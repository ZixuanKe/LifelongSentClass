If you like rally cars get this game you will have fun.It is more oriented to & # 34 ; European market & # 34 ; since here in America there is n't a huge rally fan party . Music it is very European and even the voices from the game very & # 34 ; English & # 34 ; accent.The multiplayer is n't the best but it works just ok .	1
I had Dirt 2 on Xbox 360 and it was an okay game . I started playing games on my laptop and bought a few new games to build my collection . This game is very fun to play . It is so much better than Dirt 2 . If you like racing games you should check this out . The graphics are perfect on my compter .	1
Overall this is a well done racing game , with very good graphics for its time period . My family has has enjoyed playing it a great deal . I personally think a steering wheel controller is almost a necessity for this game , but an x box type controller would probably work . The keyboard would be almost impossible , and not very fun . The `` windows live '' system detracts greatly , since you must log in and be online to play or save game progress . There was a mees up with my `` Live '' log in and the game would no longer accept my activation code and I had to rebuy the game if I wanted to play . There is no customer support at all . Dirt 2 suffers from this serious flaw as well . 4 1/2 star game 1 star Windows Live feature .	1
Loved playing Dirt 2 and I thought the graphics were good . Purchased Dirt 3 as an addition to the other ... and the graphics are absolutely `` Gorgeous '' If you liked Dirt or Dirt 2 ... you are going to love Dirt 3 . The game was easier to configure with my Logitech wireless rumblepad ... and with my EVGA GTX 580 , and all detail set to full on graphics at 1920 x 1080 I get over 100 fps . The game looks good , plays well and is a blast !	1
I initially gave this one star because it was crashing on me constantly but I recently narrowed it down to a plug-in I was using for my porsche wheel . Game plays well and looks gorgeous when image spanned across three monitors . I would have given it five stars if it was n't for the annoying Microsoft Games for Live application that makes you go through hoops to set it up and causes problems of it 's own ( occasional crashes )	1
I 'm not quite finished with the game 's DiRT Tour mode , but I believe I 've experienced the bulk of what the game has to offer . And I 'm happy to say that the game is indeed awesome . Great cars , great tracks and racing modes , excellent gameplay and graphics . The highlight has been racing in the snow on various tracks in Aspen . There are also some really cool obstacle courses on pavement , which are new to the series.At first , I felt that the game was plagued with the same difficulty spike DiRT 2 had , where you can win any race without trying on casual difficulty , then lose big time on medium . Then I found the custom difficulty settings where you can choose from 5 levels of challenge , then pick and choose from all the other assists and handling options . Basically , you can let the game play itself by just holding the throttle and steering , or take gradual steps to reach what you feel works best for you . Love this feature ! Sadly , there is no option to increase the 360 controller 's dead zone or adjust the sensitivity . I 'm doing ok as is , but some tweaking would be ideal.Much like the previous two games , the handling is a bit flighty . But that 's speeding on loose ground for you . Still , I feel things have tightened up somewhat since DiRT 2 . Still no cigar , but it 's a step forward . The game runs as smooth as silk on my 560ti wih all the settings maxed . No issues whatsoever . If you enjoy racing games , this is not one you should ignore . It 's the best DiRT so far .	1
I have been playing car racing games since their early beginning on PC . I currently have a logitech G25 force feedback wheel to play with.I have played most of the Colin Mc Rae , Need for speed , Grid and Dirt2 games before . I also tried my hands at more simulation oriented games like GTR , GTR2 , GP Legends ... Dirt2 came in as a nice and pleasant surprise . Dirt3 tops it off.As I am sure many will detail everything about this game , I will limit myself to the most important points for me.Pros : - Amazing graphics- Amazing physics- Challenging but entertaining racesCons : - Gymkhana- InterfaceWhat went through the conceptors mind about gymkhana ? Racing is not easy for most but gymkhana is really a pain in the neck.I saw the videos of Ken Block on Youtube and indeed he is really impressive . Am I even dreaming of doing the same ? No ! Racing require good racing skills to start but Gymkhana requires a perfect control of the vehicles and most of us will never achieve such level . So I find the attemps slightly pointless and extremely frustrating.Now , what about the interface ? Simply put , it does not remotely compare with Dirt2 's interface . It is messy , I had to search online to figure out where to find my best times . There are not enough info about the cars , the races , the sponsors ... It leaves a lot to desire . A complete miss.Conclusion : As far as rallye racing . This game is the best out there today.If you are one who needs crazy challenges , try the gymkhana and good luck ! In spite of my criticism , I definitely do not regreat this purchase .	1
Dirt 3 on DVDi collect racing games so had to add this to my collectionSon wated one also	1
In today 's game market it 's easy to miss racing games that are n't part of the license-heavy Forza or Gran Turismo franchises . Dirt 3 for PC is in an even worse boat than most since it 's been a giveaway for a couple years now with every DX11 compliant ATI video card . As a result a lot of people who get it send it straight to eBay and most people who do play it have not bought it new.This is a shame because Dirt 3 is a fun little game . There 's a great assortment of multinational tracks , and a wide array of classic and modern rally cars to choose from . As a rally game , Dirt 3 ditches the comfortable confines of tracks and sends you headlong across snow and gravel in a world where keeping control of your car is a greater skill than making it around the turns . Dirt 3 wears a veneer of noisy , fun arcade-style game play , but under the hood it calls for quick reactions , a good understanding of road surfaces , and nerves of steel . Sadly , it also calls for a gamepad or wheel- you will almost certainly find the keyboard too all-or-nothing for serious racing.PROS : -Visually stunning engine that makes full use of DirectX 11 effects-Soundtrack is an appealing mix of classic prog rock and modern music that does a good job of being vaguely European and not too intrusive-Successfully models an arcade-like complexity of play with a surprisingly deep simulation of track conditions and vehicle handling-In-car camera gives a stomach-churning stream of nonstop thrills as you launch over crests and 2-wheel hairpins-Probably the most realistic depiction of drifting/powersliding to appear in a video game ( it 's frightening , nauseating , and usually a bad idea ) -3D support ! CONS : -Lower difficulties are n't much fun , highest difficulty is brutally hard-Small fanbase of hardcore racing nuts may make multiplayer a bit hard for newcomers ( Dirt 3 players seem pretty nice though ) -Essentially requires some sort of analog input-May confuse players who are n't familiar with the rules and conditions of rally-style racingOther thoughts : -You need to plug your youtube credentials into the game to let it export your highlights to YouTube . I do n't think CodeMasters wants to rip you off , but if it makes you uncomfortable , create a new Google identity for use with Dirt 3 . Easy ! -LEARN THE TRACKS . Learn the tracks , learn the tracks , learn the tracks.-If you want to win , employ a Fin !	1
lot of people do n't like RALLY because they already tried gran turismo game . to tell you the truth gran turismo RALLY physic is just boring boring boring . gran turismo only good for racing simulation but RALLY part is suck ! ! ! ! dirt 2 amazed me how much fun it was and now dirt 3 with 3 time more race tracks than dirt 2 . MUST BUY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
This is a must have for any gamer . Codemasters really hit a home run on this one . I would like to see F1 2011 be this good using the ego engine 2.0 and the physics model in this game is right on the money . This game is the reason everyone should buy the best graphics card they can afford . I am using a nvidia 460 overclocked , and I have on order a 590 . I want to run this game with everything on highest level . I swear to you that even with the 460 + , the graphics are very realistic and I really enjoy racing at ground level . This game makes Codemasters the king of graphics realism . BUY THIS GAME ! ! ! ! ! December 6 , 2011 I saw my review of the Internet and wanted to update it for you . First of all anyone with this program , BUY the extra environments and cars . It is money well spent and a first class job of an addon . I wanted everyone to know that this program is still the top of the heap in graphics . I bought Battlefield 3 and it is good , but not the standard of the ego 2 engine . Codemasters are the king of graphics so far and I find that the more realism a game has , the more adicted you will become . No other program running with all variables to the max , looks like Dirt 3 . Thank God for codemasters and I can hardly wait for GRID 2 in the summer .	1
Works good , however is not `` like a new '' with a little not important defect in appearance ! Really good , and works fantastic !	1
I bought this microphone to further enhance my Rock Band experience . I was not disappointed . It kept in tune well ( which was a problem I saw with other microphones ) and was light enough to not be a burden of any kind . I do n't mind that it is not wireless , since I would n't move around much anyways . Also , the fact that it does n't have buttons did n't bother me , mainly because I do n't mind using a controller to navigate . I do think it could have been packaged better , but I do n't fault the microphone for it . Overall , a very simplistic , yet functional , design that works well .	1
I love it ! Use it all the time . Really works perfectly with all games that you need a mic for .	1
Works great ! Another cool thing , even if a song does n't have `` harmony '' ( parts for more than one singer ) you can still do fake-harmony as all mics plugged in remain active . However , the back-up singers will not be rated and will actually mess with the lead as the game does n't differentiate what mic is being used for lead UNLESS there actually is a harmony part . Meaning = if you 're just singing to party , you can use all three mics on any song and they 'll all just be treated as lead . Pretty cool when you have a room full of mic hogs around the house like we do . lol It 's just like when people would gang up all on one mic during a song , but now they actually feel like rock stars having their own mics . For this reason , we just always keep all three mics plugged in and anyone can just pick one up and join in . Just do n't expect a good score ; - )	1
my grandkids ( and their parents ) love playing with the microphone along with the guitar we got.this really is a lot of fun for everyone . would totally recommend getting this if someone has an interest in music ( singing ) ...	1
We bought this item for our Wii . It does not work at all for it . : - ( So that was a disapointment . We did decide to keep it though because it works wonderfully on our x-box 360 .	1
Great game ! I love the storyline and graphics , as well as the fighting style . Minus the super long time it takes traveling the ocean , this game is a blast , and a must-have for any fan of the Zelda franchise .	1
I played the original Zelda as a boy . I 've enjoyed a lot of good times playing this updated version with my 10 yr. old son . Great adventures and game play , and luckily we can find tips for problems we confront on the internet . Very well designed game that is user friendly . Awesome .	1
lookin for a rpg ? this is the game for you . filled with many hours of gameplay to find all the hidden items . casual gameplay , unless you try to collect everything , then it 's hardcore . good controls and challenging puzzels give this game its rateing .	1
Ocarina was almost beyond word . But this is a cruising , powerful , and fun rival ! The worst thing about it is the seemingly endless confusing ocean . I do not look forward to trying to finger out witch Island I have to go to in which order ( as I think there is an order ) . But I ignore all that for now and just enjoy the wonderful game . cruising blue waters , mystery , dungeons ... And I still enjoy exploring the Islands .	1
So , it 's definitely original , and true to formula , but there are a few aspects about this game that just do n't make sense to me . The cell-shaded graphics take some getting used to , but I like them.My biggest complaint is that sometimes I 'd be sailing somewhere , and could leave , make a sandwich , eat that sandwich , and come back , and still not be at my destination . Also , not including the side-objectives , it 's a relatively short game.Is it better ? No . Is it a Zelda worthy of the title ? Yeah . I recommend at least playing it before making judgments or assumptions .	1
My oldest grandson loves this game . I can remember playing it when I was young and it was good back then but even better now .	1
While the product is what it is described as , it unfortunately will give me no signal whatsoever . I believe it is a fault of the a/v cable side , as plugging that in , unplugging it , blowing on it , hissing at it , calling it names , then plugging it back in seems to make it work again . I did check and have the problem across more than one tv , so it 's not the tv 's fault . I have no way to determine with confidence if it is a fault of the Wii , but I doubt so , as the Wii has no problem with its standard definition cabling that it came with ( why , Wii , did you not include component/hdmi cabling by default ? HD is n't that rare ) . Ah , but it is the most inexpensive version of this cable I could find , and the picture is markedly better using this than the original cabling .	1
This product is very good and works fine . Buy it if you want it . it lets your we display in HD format of 480p which looks alittle better than normal Av cable it comes with . To the untrained eye you might not even notice the diffrence .	1
This was exactly what was needed and has worked flawlessly since being received . I recommend it , if you need one .	1
i got this to hook up me will to my 72inc h/d tv it set it up to 1080i not 1080p but besides that it 's a grate cable ! ! !	1
The movers packed my Wii cables in a separate box so I could n't find them . I ordered this as it would be quicker and I was n't disappointed . It is inexpensive and it works . I did have my Wii setup manual so it was no problem to get up and running right away . Sometimes you get what you pay for , and sometimes it is better .	1
This is a nice little arcade game with good graphics and some good chatter . It 's fun to play with after spending time with DCS Blackshark . It 's a good shootem up . enjoyable !	1
Anyone who has ever played a flight sim can tell this is not like A10-warthog just by reading the info on the game.This is an arcade type game with some sim stuff add to make it sell more and be kind of fun and fast to play.Sometimes we all just want to blow the ( blank ) out of things and unwind.This is fairly well made and the graphics are ok for what it is ( a game ) .If you want a real flight sim this is not it.If you just want to get online and have some fun with others for a while this is it.The target aircraft can do hard right and left turns that would take the wings of any aircraft and thats not right but this is a game and not a sim.This was made sometime ago and graphics have come along way but it is ok for it 's time.You will not have any issues installing this or running this game on most systems with a gtx460 or better.You can max out all setting with one evga gtx560ti 2gb video card.The install dose take some time to get done and it will update for you when you run the sim the first time.This all takes 30min or so counting the install of the game.It is what it is and thats a game not a flight sim but it is fun to play a few hours now and then.I have a solid system and have had no issues running this at all.If you are looking for a real flight sim that has ture reallistic flight of the aircraft and working cockpits , this is not for you.Try A10-warthog or wings over europe or wings over vietnam or IL-2.These are flight sims and run well on any solid sysetm with xp or windows 7 running .	1
The most amazing graphics you could see ! If you own a flight simulator yoke and/or throttle quadrent you can make your gaming experice easier . The Crash effects may not show in trailers or videos , but in the actual game you can see the damage . I higly recomend to purchase this product . Happy Sailing ! To Reader : THIS IS NOT A LITTLE LITTLE KIDS GAME IT IS COMCLACATED !	1
I love this simulator it is a lot of fun controlling ships and boats . I only wish the color was better , because all the water is usually grey . But , other than that you will have a great time if you love ships .	1
This game is a good way on getting at the helm of the RMS Titanic and I am very well satisfied with it . I do hope that any of you who does decied ot buy it will also enjoy it .	1
I still have my silicone protective case and it has n't let me down a single time ! Very durable , high quality and has n't rip at all !	1
covers the controller more then others and is pretty durable , great grip to it as well and keeps its color , looks solid .	1
nice skin for xbox controllers makes them more slip free and smooth softer too good deal and nice stuff try one	1
I 'm revising my earlier review . i had only rated my transaction 3 stars previously due to shipping problems . After the seller contacted me to do what they could to help with the problem I have to reconsider . They contacted me promptly and went above and beyond in their effort to make me happy . Thank you . This was the second case I 've purchased and would recommend it to anyone . Thanks again .	1
I 've bought these before . They slip right on and unless you get one with an obvious defect , they should last for years . These are a must have if you are afraid of your kids messing up your controllers . Then again , maybe they should get their own ! lol	1
This silicone cover has a very nice feel to it ! Do n't use this with dirty hands , dirt will stick to it . This is a ok product for your 360 controller .	1
Put on my controllers so it would like not get wear and tear and they are great ! BUY ! THEM ! ! AMAZING	1
My brother had one of these for the longest time so I used his until he wanted it back . I found this a lil while ago and have been loving it ever since , giving the controller much needed grip and makes holding it for long gaming sessions much more comfortable .	1
Easy install and feels great . The skin fits really well and functions properly . I did have to trim up around the triggers because they moved around while I used them , but after that it was perfect .	1
My son loves it he says it makes it more comfortable and easier on his hands for those marathon Black Ops 2 sessions .	1
As soon as I slipped this on my controller , I knew that I 'd never take it off ! ! It makes the controller much more comfortable in your hands , and does not slip if you play for a long time and tend to get sweaty fingers !	1
Have had this skin for almost 2 months and so far there are no signs of wear or tear which is good . Its sticky just enough to be grippy but not overly so . It protects the controller fairly well . Keeps it from getting dirty as fast especially if you have a white controller.Overall it feels good and is comfortable even in long play periods . The only problem I have is there is annoying little piece up by the triggers on both sides . Its right in between the trigger and the bumper buttons and there is no tension on the piece so when you switch between the bumper and triggers it can sometimes flip up and your finger will catch it . Not really a deal breaker or a big deal or anything since I plan on cutting it off anyways . Plan on buy another so far after this one falls apart . Will update my review if it doesnt last long .	1
This is not the first one of these I have had , in fact this is about my 8th . There are many different skin types and different skin makers , so you have to judge each on it 's own merit . My controller skin arrived today , well ahead of expected delivery , just as described solid black and silicone . Fit is just perfect , and installation had no problems . Good comfortable smooth texture , while still providing a much better grip than on the hard slick controller plastic . I like to clean my game equipent regularly , and I always clean even new items before using . This is a great way to test the quality of the item , I cleaned the skin using isopropanal alchohol , no gumming ( like you get with lower grade skins ) and no color bleed onto the rag , this tells me it is definitly silicone not some rubber stuff . Once on the controller grip is good , comfort is good , feel is natural . I am very pleased with this controller skin , I have been needing to get one for my extra controller . I will definitly be ordering a few more later , a friend has a birthday coming up .	1
I really like this skin . It makes the controller nicer to play with , and looks nice as well.Yes , i would recommend this to a friend .	1
Considering its just a rubber cover for the XBOX 360 controller , actually , it 's made well ... and the price -- not bad at all . Excellent product for an excellent controller .	1
Unlike others on this site , these fit very good and the material is durable , which is of utmost importance to me . I 'm glad I found this item .	1
put this on my controller no hand cramps after 7 hours of all night gaming . if you want to make the controller a little bigger and easier to hold this is what you want .	1
It works perfectly ! Nothing is wrong with it .	1
Not sure what you can really write about this item , it works fine ... I use it on the Wii to play Gamecube games and it works great and fast , but the Gamecube was always much faster than PS2 anyway ...	1
Bought this for an old gamecube i recently won in an auction . Seems to work just fine , purchased a few more since it works and the price is right .	1
Works great with my game cube . I have n't tried it with a wii , but by the description , it should work there too .	1
just right ! works great , I ' ll be ordering again laters ! hope you will still be there then ! see you !	1
This is a great and cheap memory card . It is what it is ... ..it is compatible for Wii and gamecube its 64 MB 1019 block memory . If you need one , but it.Great product	1
Works great . Cheap price and way more memory than on the Nintendo make . Really great for you retro fans out there .	1
Works perfectly for the game cube I purchased . Came very quickly and i would buy this again when i need to .	1
One of the largest memory cards for the gamecube . It works great and loads fast . No need for formatting at all .	1
My lady dug out her kids old gamecube and games and started playing her old favorite Harvest Moon titles . She quickly discovered the memory card was n't there anymore when she could n't save her games . So in search I went.I was surprised to find these were still available and not too expensive . This one does the trick , has room for quite a few saves . She is happy , so I am happy .	1
This allows me to preserve whatever precious space I have left on my console for other stuff . I may purchase another one in the near future .	1
I bought this because I recently bought a gamecube for old times sake . This memory card works great , and was one of the cheaper cards .	1
These things work really great and can be combined for even longer cable lengths but be warned that the rubber shielding seems to slip around the plug head . Not a big deal , but could lead to eventual short .	1
The product was just as the picture and works fine . It is long enough to play comfortably at a distance . There is no delay in control using this product .	1
My nephew wanted an older gamecube game to play in our Wii . Once I purchased the game for him , we found out that the Wii controllers wo n't work with the gamecube games when played in the Wii . After doing a little research , I realized we needed the classic gamecube controller and a gamecube memory card . Once we got both of those , the gamecube game that we bought finally worked ! After playing the game for a bit while being & # 34 ; tethered & # 34 ; to the Wii system because of the cable for the controller , we decided we needed extension cables to have a bit more freedom . So we got these controller extension cables . He is happy !	1
And now I can sit back far enough to see my entire TV and avoid wielders burn in my retina . So simple , yet so obvious a necessity given how freaken short the big & # 34 ; N & # 34 ; made their controller 's cords . Buy them now and heal your spine !	1
These are great . If you have a wii and use your GameCube controllers these are a must have . I can sit on the couch and not have to lean in towards the console and have the freedom to move around . They 're perfect	1
I play Brawl and Melee all the time with my siblings and friends , and sitting squished together 3 feet from the tv was a pain . So I got these cables because it was cheep and could solve most of our problems with this , even if it did not look like they would last long from some of the reviews . but when i got these they worked great and did not seem cheap at all . I expected there to be lag with the controls , but there was n't . They have survived a month of intense fighting and are still in top-notch condition . These are great if you need room or do not like sitting 3 feet from the screen .	1
I bought these to extend the length of the game cube controller reach . Everyone that uses these has no issues with poor controller reaction times and can sit just about anywhere to play .	1
Works exactly as advertised . Bought these along with a 2-pack of controllers for the GameCube , as my TV is a ways away from my couch and i wanted to play multi-player with my wife . The controller plugs into the extension cable about as snugly as the controller ( and the other end of the extension cable ) plugs into the GameCube , which is to say plenty snug enough to keep it in while moving the controller and cable around semi-violently , but not snug enough to keep a controller attached after being thrown across the room ( just an example ) . One major concern I did have when I bough these was the possibility of lag due to the signal from the controller having to travel farther . This concern was unwarranted , as I have noticed no difference in response time either way . On durability , I 've had these for almost 2 years and they have n't shown any noticeable signs of wear . Throw in a reasonable price ( $ 4 when I bought it from Amermedia in 2012 ) and this is a heck of a deal for people that need a product like this . I would recommend .	1
At 6 feet and at 4 dollars each its a good deal , ive seen some other cables for much more and these work just fine , i like that theyre black and they connect into the controller with ease . buy it with confidence .	1
This Cable extender worked great ! I used it when and had absolutely no problems with it at all ! It adds a good 6ft of extra cable length . I tried hooking two together and I found no extra input lag using these cables.Great if you need the extra cable !	1
With the amount of interference I kept getting with the wireless controllers , I was stuck far too close to the TV to enjoy many of the visual aspects of the classics . This cable extension cord made playing some of my old Gamecube games just as fun as the day it came out . A big must have if you ca n't get the wireless format to work properly .	1
i bought the 2 x Wii Gamecube GC Extension Cable Cord but after a few uses , it started working wrong , duplicating signalsif i press A in the controller , the game detects A being pressed two times , this is for all buttons , without the cord the error is no longer there .	1
They 're awesome cables though ! They work great and add those several feet you always seem to lack . Now I can play my Gamecube games on my Wii from the couch ! No batteries to change !	1
I purchased these for my Wii as Nintendo no longer produces Wavebird controllers by virtue of them being sued by a patent owner over the technology . I did n't want to pay for a used Wavebird on eBay , so I bought some of these . I sit back from my HDTV about 9 feet so I needed these for the wired Gamecube controllers and they work very well . Even with Mario Kart Wii , there is some lag with the Wavebird , but there is no lag with these extension cables . Highly recommended !	1
My living room is fairly large , so these chords make it nice to play games which require the old controllers . My family can play video games from the comfort of our couch rather than sitting on the hard floor close to the console .	1
I can now sit on the couch to play instead of putting a chair in front of the TV . There are no problems .	1
For people who still have a GameCube , but do n't have a wireless controller ( do n't bother , you 'll be disappointed because none of them come with the damn adapter , ) these cords are fantastic . I can take my controller all over the house with them if I please , and they do n't cause lag or short out to any degree I can tell . They 're not shoddily-made and have lasted well so far . I 'd buy them again .	1
These awesome-sauce things make any GC controller as far extended as a wavebird . Given these days any games I have time to play are all via the Wii anyway , having the extra length for GC controllers is great .	1
I bought 2 sets of this product ( so 4 cables total ) . I was not disappointed . They all work perfectly and they accomplished what I bought them for . I have 2 big screen TV 's and the 2 rooms I use for these have couches that sit back a lot further than the standard gamecube controller cord would reach . Hook 1 of these extensions up to each controller and problem solved . I also like the length because I still had room to go back farther but this allowed each cord to rest on the ground so there is less of a tripping hazard for those people that never fail to walk in front of everyone and do n't pay attention to the cords . They even work for Bongos so that is a nice feature to be able to move the bongos back as well for those games .	1
I always hated how Gamecube controller 's cords were so ridiculously short . Since I use them on my Wii now , it is much more hazardous for my Wii if someone trips over the short cables . This was a perfect solution to my problems . So far I have n't had any problems with them and they allow me and my friends to not sit 6 ft away from the Wii . Another great thing about these is that you can plug them end on end to make a longer cable .	1
This is n't a particularly deep product . They are wire extenders to be used for the Nintendo Gamecube controllers . They come in a pack of two which is fantastic for the cheap price . They extend approximately 6 feet in length , and with the already fairly long wire on the Gamecube controller already , these come in handy if you need to sit somewhat far away in a regular sized room . I have had no trouble with these at all as they function properly and connection just as easily to any controller . Getting these beats paying the higher price for the Wavebird wireless Gamecube controllers . I 'm on a budget so I 'll just stick with a wired controller , no big deal .	1
The gamecube controller wire is length has always been annoying . Once got these that solved that problem . They work great , fit right , and do not cause any controller lag . Great buy .	1
this really cam in handy we need a extra length for the controller and it was perfect exactly what we needed	1
These extenders work as expected . I bought them when I wanted to buy Double Dash for the game cube to play on my Wii . If you 're used to playing the Wii , you probably sit much further away than a standard GC controller will reach , so definitely pick some of these up .	1
This Is Eaiser Than the first one , but it 's pretty fun i liked it . You get to play some original characters like , Bad Mister Frosty , Taffy , The Blob , Bonker & Ickybodclay ( My Favorite ) .If You liked this game then check out , Clayfigter , C2 : Judgement clay , Clay Fighter Extreme , Clayfighter 63 1/3 : Sculptor 's Cut , Clay Fighter : Tournament Edition .	1
Why do so many people love to hate the Clay Fighter series ? Okay , even I 'll admit that the Genesis installments were far from masterpieces . But this one gets almost everything right.I first read about this game in an old back issue of Nintendo Power , from 1997 . It mentioned numerous characters that eventually got the axe ; some , like Lady Liberty and the Zappa Yow Yow Boys , were remolded for the `` Sculptor 's Cut '' released to rental outlets . Another , HoboCop , was gone for good . However , since I only had molasses-fast dialup , I was unaware of these facts . When I saw it , along with a Nintendo 64 , in a game store less than a year later , I knew I had to have it . As the first N64 game I ever owned , it may not receive a totally objective evaluation , but I 'll try my hardest to be fair.The one thing that immediately jumps out at the player is the self-mocking sense of humor . The moment you see the P in the Interplay logo fall apart into a C , you know what you 're in for . During fights , the characters themselves spew out one-liners and funny quips almost as much as they do punches ; while this gets repetitive after a while , it still brings on a chuckle or two.As one would expect , the fighters are all made out of clay , and animated via stop-motion . While a few ( namely 'Ickybod Clay ' ) are a little uninspired , the rest are a joy to behold , and all are animated smoothly with nary a hint of pixelation . Unfortunately , the polygonal backgrounds , while often funny in their own right , do n't hold up nearly as well ; they range from decent to horribly angular.The selection of characters is slightly limited at the start , giving you nine clay combatants , but three more can be unlocked . Numerous characters return from the previous outings , including mainstays Bad Mr. Frosty , the Blob , and Taffy . Ickybod Clay and Bonker return from the first game , and Hoppy from C2 : Judgement Clay ( not making that up ) comes back as T-Hoppy . The other fighters include Kung Pow , Houngan , and Interplay 's own Earthworm Jim . The characters are balanced well for the most part , and their moves are just as funny as the fighters themselves.My favorite aspect of this game is the control . The N64 's controller has its share of detractors who say it 's not ideal for fighting games ; they could n't be more wrong . The six-button scheme works in the same way as other one-on-one fighters , but here each level of punch or kick ( weak , medium , and Brutal ) has a noticeable difference . The combos are also easy to grasp and easy to execute , something that few fighting games as of late are able to get right.The story , as with most fighting games , is so inconsequential as to be vestigial , but it 's slightly humorous nonetheless . Basically , Dr. Kiln , who took control of the clay meteor in Judgement Clay , is now trying to take over the world by spreading the clayified state to the whole planet , and then he can somehow control it . I dunno , but you fight him as the last boss.Overall , this game is certainly the best in the series . Anyone who likes fighting games at all should grab this , as it 's certainly worth claying .	1
I have been a fan of the whole of the Clay Fighter series and i have to say that i am slightly disappointed with this one . The graphics are okay , there are plenty of characters to choose from , but i think that it is far to easy and that the game had been rushed . The price is excellent and i recommend to everyone that you get this as the price of this game wont be around for long . If you want the best fighting game on the N64 then i wouldnt recommend this , but if you want some fun then this is the game for you	1
have n't play for long time and love this game as enjoy play . it good play game I guess well alright	1
So glad I ordered this game , it was like nostalgia overload of awesome , it helps that it was in PERFECT condition with the case and booklet and got here super fast . One of the best RPGs I have ever played . And just a heads up , you totally can not beat the two unicorn bad guys in the beginning no matter what the internet tells you so do n't wast 20 hours trying to .	1
With the genre monopolized by the the Final Fantasy series , it is not suprising that this game is absent from most people 's top RPG list . To clarify , it is not as good as an FF game , but it is nonetheless enjoyable and fun.The story is pretty linear , the characters are well developed , and part III offers much of the same fun that was the original BOF for the SNES ( which was produced by Squaresoft , not Capcom ) . The only drawback is the clunky controls , which can be frustrating when you are trying to move down stairs or bend around tight corners . And while the graphics are not on par with Final Fantasy IX or Chrono Cross , this is still a great looking game.Try it . I think you will like it .	1
Breath of Fire III 's old-school graphics capture the feel of old RPGs , and how good they were , playing on NES and Super NES , back in the old days . Now I still play SNES , playing such good games as Super Godzilla , Breath of Fire I , and the Final Fantasy series . The storyline goes as follows -- Ryu is a survivor of an ancient race of dragons , the Brood , which nearly destroyed the world . However , he is a good dragon . He allies himself with Yraall Region thieves , Rei and fellow dragon Teepo , who at the time does n't know he 's a dragon . He aligns himself with the young Princess of Wyndia , Princess Nina , and the daughter of a smart scientist , Momo , a mutated vegetable named Peco who has a lot of significance at the end of the game , and a Guardian of Urkan Tapa who 's race once fought and defeated the dragons in a war , Garr . Together they quest to find Ryu 's origin and other members of his race , and to find out if Ryu is evil or not . With beautiful music , surroundings , and a great storyline , this is one of the best RPGs of all -- with many mini-games abound and a fantastic battle system . Definitely get this if you 're a fan of Capcom RPGs .	1
Basically , Breath of Fire 4 stole a lot of ideas from it 's predecessor , this one . It 's kinda like a degraded Breath of Fire 4 actually , but still truly brilliant , and well worth buying .	1
Love the game thanks ! This game is great from the look and the level of detail and the combat . Thanks	1
After defeating Xenogears , I was looking for a game that was fun to play , and did n't require me to do much thinking . Xenogears was a monster game that had a fantastic , yet confusing plot that really made you think . Breath of Fire 3 is a complete change of pace . Instead of going for an engrossing and confusing plot like FF7 and Xenogears , Breath of Fire 3 continues a simple , but fun plot that feels refreshing to play after finishing a monster game like Xenogears.Breath of Fire 3 does n't have an overly confusing story . Once long ago , there was a clan on earth known as the dragon clan . After gaining enough power to destroy the world , the dragon clan suddenly disappeared . You play as Ryu , a young boy who suffers from amnesia . He soon befriends two thieves named Rei and Teepo . After he gets into trouble with the authorities , he soon finds out he is an ancestor of the dragon clan . So he embarks on a journey to uncover his mysterious past.Sound original ? Sorry , but if it 's originality that you want , you wo n't find it here . Even the battle system is painfully unoriginal . As you play it , it will feel like you have played something else exactly like it . The story , the battle system , everything feels like it was used many times before , and i hate to say this , but the ending is very disappointing.However , with all gripes aside , Breath of Fire 3 is a fun and engaging quest . My favorite part of the game was the characters ; they are interesting , and very funny . I also liked that the plot never once got confusing . Even though it was unoriginal , it never got off target and it even sometimes kept you on the edge of your seat.With all the complaints aside , Breath of Fire 3 is fun game to play through . After playing through a monster game like Xenogears , it is refreshing to play . Unfortunately , do n't get too excited about the ending .	1
This game is one of my all time favorites , I give it a 10/10 in the RPG genre . It is a turn based RPG , that is fun to play . I own this game for the PSP and the now the PS1 . This game is a rare find in good condition . If you find a better RPG than this , besides the final fantasy games of course , let me know !	1
Breath of Fire III is one of those games that can induce a trance of nostalgia upon thought . I can say this about few games because most are powered by processors that reflect obsession with graphics and innovation . Innovation is necessary , and appreciated , but games like BOF3 need never disappear . It caters to the old-time gamer in all RPG veterens , delivering a simplistic save the world storyline and involving gameplay . And what gameplay ! It 's simplicity and charm will , hopefully , impress those who give it a chance because it is very deserving of credit . Last , I must mention the fishing system . It 's incredibly addictive , simple , and enjoyable . Nothing else could more easily describe it . Throw in about another hundred fish and a wider variety of rods and bait , and you 'd have a full game that I would have to own ! It 's that good . For everyone : whether an RPG-newbie or a hardcore veteren , you should give this game a chance . Fun does n't begin to describe it .	1
This was the only Breath of Fire game I 've beaten . But I must say that it was fun . The story and side quests kept me going.One of the downers was that you ca n't hardly change your angle.A big thumbs up going to the fact that you do n't have to change screens to get into a battle ( like Chrono Trigger ) . This saves lots of time and makes thing more dramatic ! Fighting in narrow hallways and thick forests was great ! I 'm not going to spoil it for anyone ... but the ending sucked badly . But not enough to stop me from buying the next sequel . ^_^	1
Breath of Fire III arrives almost three years after the fun-but strictly orthodox-Super NES title , Breath of Fire II . Although BOFIII is n't a radical departure from the earlier games in the series , do n't let that turn you off ; it 's reassuring to see that sprite graphics have n't given way entirely to origami-style polygons . Sporting a quasi-medieval European setting , a heroic story line , and turn-based battles , BOFIII will appeal to fans of Square 's Final Fantasy series and Working Designs ' Lunar titles . An Epic Journey Breath of Fire III starts with the discovery of a tiny dragon that goes on a deadly rampage before it 's captured . The dragon escapes and is transformed into a young boy named Ryu , who is befriended by a pair of delinquents , whose thoughtless pranks get them captured by some truly evil people . Ryu is left for dead , but his dragon powers revive him , so he sets off in pursuit of his friends ' captors , unaware that he 's about to be drawn into an ever-deepening pool of danger , deceit , and death . Like earlier BOF titles , Ryu can befriend several partners during his epic journey . Nina , the princess of Windia , makes another appearance in the series , although in this game she 's apparently unrelated to her earlier incarnations . Ryu , too , shares the name of a character from the series , but he 's also unrelated . However , Gobi , from the first BOF game , makes a cameo appearance . Nostalgic Graphics Graphically , BOFIII is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessors . Texture-mapped polygons are used to create the backgrounds , terrain , and buildings , while sprites are used to compose the various characters . More animation , colors , and special effects have been added to this version , but the look of the game will still be familiar to fans of the BOF games . The three-quarter-overhead view field map can be rotated somewhat so you can peek behind obstacles , but not to any great extent . Battles are fought directly on the field map , with characters and monsters displayed diagonally in one of four directions : Two are seen from the front and two from the rear.Solid Craftsmanship The battle system is turn-based , with some consideration given to quickness : Characters move in sequence to their speed parameter . For example , in some battles you may want to use light armor so that your character moves quicker instead of heavy armor which can slow you down . Also , certain characters have speed parameters higher than their enemies and may get extra turns while fighting . Beyond the usual manual , magic , and item attacks , characters can transform into dragons . Initially , only Ryu has the power to transform ( and only when he 's far into the game ) , but the other characters gain that power later . Transformation , though , requires crystals called Dragon Genes and AP ( magic points ) for the Genes chosen . By combining up to three Genes , different dragons can be created ; the more Genes you use , the more powerful your dragon , though you 'll use more AP . AP is also consumed at a constant pace while the dragon is in battle . Finally , you can learn monster skills for special attacks and spells . The construction of Breath Of Fire III 's battle system-and of the whole game , for that matter-is very polished-thanks to excellent controls . You wo n't be moaning about the way this game handles . Sound Bites However , all is n't well in BOFIII . The sound effects are fine , if not particularly inspired . In battle , the characters emit rudimentary shouts , screams , and spell names , but not much more . And even though the sounds can get annoying , they 're not anywhere near as badly done as the soundtrack . The music veers widely from unmemorable electronica to hopeless schmaltz , and more often than not , it does n't add to the atmosphere of the story . The music seems more appropriate for a corporate infomercial than a heroic fantasy RPG . Aside from the inexplicably bad soundtrack , BOFIII is worth a long look from RPG fans . Although it does n't possess the visual and aural magnificence of Final Fantasy VII ( which few games will ever accomplish ) , Breath of Fire III holds up as a very enjoyable RPG in which sure craftsmanship is easily evident .	1
Many may disregard the Breath of Fire series as just another RPG but Capcom has done a beutiful Job with this title . They pulled out a lot on this case . Beutiful 2D graphics that only Capcom can do , good music , simple controls make this an excellent purchase . Chances are you may find this at a good price somewhere so I say go for it .	1
& quot ; Breath of Fire 3 & quot ; is a very interesting and well made game . The plot is pretty good , and the characters are interesting and memorable . One thing I do miss from the older & quot ; Breath of Fire & quot ; is the way they transformed into dragons ; the process in the current game is excellent ( I just prefer the older methods ) . My favorite part of the game is that you start off playing a young version of the character , and then later in the game , you get to play a more mature version of the same character . This game is a lot of fun and suitable for most people who enjoy the genre .	1
Street Fighter is perhaps the definitive fighting game series . Should you feel it necessary to buy absolutely every individual cartridge/disc of the six games contained on the two SF Collections , then do so and spend a ton of cash . They are all excellent titles , but the two collections of a game that defined the fighting genre are perfect . Street Fighter Collection , the original that is in the spotlight , is actually the more up-to-date one . While it does not contain the original Street Fighter II , it does contain 3 classic Street Fighter games . First is Super Street Fighter II : The New Challengers , released on SNES and Genesis in 1994 . It was mindbendingly good the first time I played it . It had a solid 16 fighters . All 8 from Street Fighter II , the bosses , plus 4 new characters never heard of before : Cammy , Dee Jay , Fei Long , and T. Hawk . You might think , `` Oh wow , a new edition with new fighters . Never seen THAT before . '' Well , you 're wrong . Super Street Fighter II did contain 4 new arenas ( respectively the ones for the new fighters ) . It also had newly mixed music , newly animated profile shots , and newly animated backgrounds . Basically , it was a perfect upgrade . Super Street Fighter II Turbo is also included . It may seem like Super Street Fighter II with the speed like Street Fighter II Turbo , but it added something . Each character had one SUPER MOVE . From Ryu and Ken 's Shinkuu Hadoken to Chun Li 's Kikousho , they really gave a great new edge to the series . Akuma is even hidden in this upgrade . Also , the definitive of the three Street Fighter Alpha games , Street Fighter Alpha 2 , gets upgraded to Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold Edition . Cammy is added on , and Evil Ryu becomes playable ( YAY ! ) . What 's strange is that some of the cast gets an additional playability in their SFII : CE animation . So it 's definetely worth picking this up ... if you do n't already have all three of these games for your SNES ( Alpha 2 is also on the PS ) .	1
Forgotten amidst the blood of Mortal Kombat and 3-D presentations of Virtua Fighter and Tekken , the Street Fighter II series initiated the fighting game craze . Whereas its successors won their fanbases with graphical geegaws , Street Fighter II 's strength was superb , well-balanced , uncomplicated gameplay that was simple to learn but exhausting to master . Street Fighter Collection accurately reproduces that gameplay , making for an excellent anthology , but not a flawless one.Firstly , the omission of the first three iterations of Street Fighter II is glaring . Given the lack of complexity of those games , one has to wonder if Capcom 's developers were too lazy ( or their marketers too greedy ) to finish those titles for this release , instead leaving them for Street Fighter Collection II . Graphically the games are preserved admirably , although CD audio forces the game to start each track over when speeding the tempo up , unlike in the arcade games . The long load times are excruciating , as is each title requiring its own Memory Card block , when the high scores for both titles could easily fit into a single block.The inclusion of Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold is nice , but seems out of place in what is supposedly a historical collection . Perhaps the developers felt they rushed the original Street Fighter Alpha 2 to market , and tried to save face by placing the more polished Gold version in this compilation . And since this third title requires its own Memory Card block , Street Fighter Collection actually requires three blocks in all , not one as is advertised on the packaging.Still , all three games have withstood the test of time , and are worth purchasing for gameplay if not historical value . But the aforementioned drawbacks of the Street Fighter II games and dubious packaging do detract from the compilation as a whole .	1
The one thing people are missing to consider about this game is that , if you notice , the collection is a collection indeed , and a fine one at that , but mostly shows how the Street Fighter series evolved . If you note that it goes from Super Street Fighter II , to SSFII Turbo , to SF Alpha 2 gold . Well , my point is that it shows in order how the series evolved to becoming more complex and technical with Super Combos added . 1st it starts with Super II , no supers at all , just classic , then goes to Super II Turbo , where the super combo made it 's debut , and every body had only one super , then goes to Alpha 2 Gold , where it really shows what you can do with a super combo , plus more characters , and every body had atleast 2 super combos.Lets go over it:1st - classic with no supers lots of characters2nd - classic with supers making debut same amount of characters3rd - advance from 2nd with more characters and 2 supers for eachNot only that , but it 's a classic game , mostly to me , just an example of the evolution of the series , if you are still looking for what you thought this game would be , get the 2nd one , otherwise , it 's a wise decision to go with this one .	1
Finally , after YEARS of seeing Mega Man in 2D shooter side-scroller gameplay , Capcom began to realize the video game scene was changing , and realism was becoming more important than ever . So in 1997 Capcom decided to take the classic gameplay of the old Mega Man games and bring Mega Man to an ENTIRE new 3D world . I finally got to experience the 3D Mega Man adventure a few days ago , in July 2006 . So it took me NINE years to finally play it ! What can I say ? I 'm slow ! I have a few problems with certain parts of the game but overall , I 'm happy to report that the jump to 3D was a good one ( not to mention a NECESSARY one ! ) Mega Man spends the entire time in Legends jumping and shooting through a unique 3D environment.I 'm surprised so many people hate the graphics in the game . They 're quite wonderful if you ask me . Sure , the graphics may be dated because the game is nearly 10 years old ( and walking around in Mega Man Legends is sort of like walking around in a giant land of legos ) but none of that should matter because you have to take into account the amount of FUN a game provides . Mega Man Legends provides a LOT of fun.I really loved one of the very first boss fights in the game where I had to keep running and hiding behind buildings because these giant walking blue , red and yellow machines were throwing bombs and shooting laser beams at me . The first time I completed this battle it took a good 30 minutes ONLY for a bigger , badder machine to come in and defeat me in seconds . At first I was angry because the game would n't let me SAVE before fighting this fourth boss . `` A half hour of work flushed down the toilet '' was the thought that went through my head.That led me to think the game might be too hard for me to handle , but it turned out I just did n't have the right upgrades for my X-buster equipped ( actually I did n't have ANYTHING equipped ! ) so when I went back to do the battle again I defeated him ( her , actually ) rather easily.Most of the enemies throughout the game are rather easy to defeat ( including the boss fights ) . Many of the boss fights will keep you on your toes , though . The strategy to defeating many of them is to KEEP RUNNING and only turn around when the moment is right and BLAST them ! The only boss who is n't easy is the very last boss ( who sounds like Michael Jackson ) because he has TWO forms . The first form you can figure out with practice , but on the second form he turns into a giant machine and THEN the challenge increases . But it 's possible to find enough money to carry up to 10 Sub-tanks to help you out DRASTICALLY . If you were to carry 10 Sub-tanks he would be a VERY easy boss ! Despite that , the game provides a nice challenge because the way the story unfolds forces you to do a LOT of things . You have to go HERE , you have to go THERE ! You have to collect THIS , you have to collect THAT ! You 'll find out just how many items and weapons are in the game when you hit the Start button and see everything in your inventory . It 's borderline INSANE.You see , to help make the game easier , what you have to do is go around searching for things ( things located in treasure chests or holes in walls ) and then you have to bring the things you collect back to this yellow vehicle where your female friend ( or sister , I forget who she is ) will be inside . She can find ways to turn many of the things you collect into important weapons for you to use . She must be smart ! I think I explained myself correctly , there . It 's kind of confusing because there 's so many things you have to collect and that 's the main reason I ca n't give the game a perfect 5-star rating . TOO MUCH ! In Mega Man Legends you will find SO many weapons and SO many upgrades that it can easily confuse someone ( like me ) who 's normally not exposed to this much activity in a video game.You have to find a little dancing monkey to save your game . When you 're lost , he can also help you by telling you where to go , unfortunately many times he does n't provide enough information . So you can be left wandering around for hours until you finally have no choice but to find a strategy guide on the internet to help you out.The music in the game is nice . It 's usually played quietly which is odd because most Mega Man music is RIGHT in your face . If you can actually hear the music , it 's pretty much what you 'd expect from a Mega Man game.Listen to those sound effects ! ! Sound familiar ? Think South Park ! One of the children ( or `` pirates '' ) sounds JUST like Butters , and a newswoman who appears later in the game sounds like Kyle 's mom ! Some of the animation looks like South Park , too . When did South Park come out ? 1997 ? Hmmm , makes you wonder ... Once again , the graphics . They are n't as bad as I thought they 'd be . Sort of blocky , of course ( since this IS Playstation ONE we 're talking about here ) but I ca n't bring myself to really hate the graphics because there 's a certain mysterious charm about them . Mega Man Legends LOOKS like a children 's game but it 's not , really . Most children would n't be able to complete the game because some boss strategies require careful timing and it would be difficult for a child.The play control ... goodness . It 's definitely not easy to figure out at first . To make Mega Man walk straight , you have to hold down the L and R buttons ( this rotates the direction Mega Man is facing ) while at the same time you have to use the up , down , left and right buttons to make Mega Man walk forward . So , because you have to do a lot of running in Mega Man Legends , when an enemy is chasing you and RIGHT behind you , you have to turn around , use the L and R buttons to face him , and THEN hit him . In the middle of hitting the L and R buttons will probably be the time you take the most hits . It may take a few hours to properly pull off but you *should* become better at it with practice.A trick to help you : when an enemy is chasing you , run as far away from him as possible and THEN turn around . Usually the enemy will be far enough away that you will have time to control Mega Man so he 's facing the enemy directly . Then , simply wait for the enemy to get close and fire away ! I would n't blame you if you could n't figure out the controls- it 's not the greatest way to control a character . I 'm not sure if Capcom improved the play control in Mega Man Legends 2.I find it funny and insulting that when you find a hole in a wall , many times a *very* small amount of money will be located there . Small enough to not be able to afford ANYTHING . It 's funny because Capcom made it like `` wow , you found money ! '' only to insult you with sofa cushion money . To find a LOT of money you have to run around shooting enemies.Just running around shooting enemies and collecting zenny ( money ) is a lot of fun , not to mention addicting . A pretty good game worth picking up .	1
Looking anywhere else people will charge more than $ 80 for an old wonderful game like this . Classic games like these are hard to come by , wish I had traded in LESS of my games when I was young .	1
Megaman legends is capcoms answer to bringing Megaman into the 3d realm on the original playstation . However this game is extremly diffrent then any other megaman game out there . In fact it has a lot in common with zelda : ocarina of time and a few rpg elements such as final fantasy while still somewhat feeling like a Megaman game . Coming from the NES and SNES Megamans I never thought I would ever compare zelda and megaman together but surprisingly it works well . Its not the greatest game or even the greatest megaman game ever but it is really fun in its own way.Most people do not like the graphics in this game but i think there done really well . The only problem graghicly is due to the early psx hardware most 3d games looked blocky and pixely at the time and this on tries to smooth things out kinda cel shadish but not quite this leads to some blockeness but its still better then most 1998 and before graphics . Kinda a 3d playable anime style to it . The sound is n't to bad in this game . Voice acting can be really good or painfully bad andThe music is catchy maybe not as much as the nes megamans but still good . However there is moments without any music . Technically speaking I would say the game has aged well.The thing I find most memorable about this game is the gameplay . Like I mentioned earlier this game takes megaman into zelda like enviorments with a few rpgs elements . There is a open world which was decent in size for its time , which the game takes place in a small town . There are dungeons to explore which you do so in order to find upgrades to your equipment . Speaking of which you can purchase and find diffrent armor and weopens with diffrent specs ( attack , fire rate , etc ) in a rpg like menu . With that being said it still manages to feel like a megaman game . There is plenty of missions of which you are running and gunning while jumping on platforms . The bosses while set up like zelda can be taken down easier by weopens you find around in dungeons.As for the story it is n't to bad . It is a little childish but its still pretty good . The characters while the voice acting can be off at times can be good are very memorable . Tron Bonne makes her debut here as a villian who became popular enough to get her own game misadventures of tron bonne and a apperance in marvel vs. capcom 2 and appearing without megaman in the 3rd . There is also a N64 port of this game which isnt as good but if you dont have a psx its still playable plus a sequel . Anyway while the hardcore 8bit megaman players may be turned off by this i would still recomend getting this game	1
This game was very good . The first 3D megaman game to be released .	1
I remember playing this when I was 12 . The story was great and I played it through more times than I can remember .	1
This was a very chanllenging game for me it . Took me about three months to beat the even old original 64 verison way back in mid 2000 I think it was when back when I was about and was midway through my final and last growth ssuppert . I belive I later when I was about 14 got the newer playstation version . I unfortunatley due to a couple years lack of experience had to use the invulerability and zeeny to comple in a lower completion time of about maybe 10 to 40 hours compared to the original completer time of about maybe 30 to 80 hours maybe more or less . This game will be fun once you get used to some changes . One megaman like in the later games of the original series was original drastically increased in size at a huge height of abou 4 to 6 six feet tall and abhout probaly weighs about 130 to maybe 350 pounds witrh his armor on this is the biggest mega man ever made . Once you learn how to concort the stroneger boss with high atatck strenght and to dog them this may be a piece of cake . To beat Jungo increas e every thing one the midssle launcher to max this will give you infinite ammo . With this one the ammo update to unlimited if you pay up enough zeeny You cane beat juno easily . Just hold down the button the missle will shot of function like heat seakers . As long as you have infinite health slash cantina points one you can sit there turning your missle into the ultimate automatic fire weapon . Pushbed the out fire down and keep shooting them of at rapid speed . Even if you get hit you should be able to take this boss down and complety both parts of the battle in about maybe 45 second 20 minutes maybeless . This is a fun games I hope you enjopy it even though roll is now longer robotic , and Rusha and Beta no longer exist . If you like this and want a really challange to test your patience and enduranc eplay the insanly hard megaman legends 2 also avilable in playstation format .	1
To me , Mega Man Legends is one of those games you 'll remember years after playing it . The game itself does n't break any new ground and has its share of flaws , but the overall experience is definitely rewarding.Mega Man Legends pretty much plays like the earlier Tomb Raider games control wise . Unfortunately , there are a few problems with the control scheme , such as a lock on system that does n't allow you to move while locked on an enemy ( which was fixed in MML2 ) , and the fact you also must contend with moving the camera manually in order to compensate for the lack of a better lock on system to hit your mark.Legends also uses a pretty similar graphic engine as Tomb Raider as well , complete with all the flat , 2D scenery that rotates with the camera and all the pixilated surfaces and clipping problems that accompanied that era of Playstation gaming . Unlike Tomb Raider , the environments in Mega Man Legends are much brighter and colorful , adding to the games cartoon-like feel , rather than the dark , dank death-trap ridden tombs that Lara Croft raids.The pretty low difficulty level of the game is also an important factor to look at as well . Considering this game is somewhat geared towards an younger audience , this is n't an error so to speak , but older , more experienced players will fly through the game in a handful of hours ( especially considering most of the game bosses can be defeated by constantly circling around them and firing ) . Thankfully , Capcom added an unlockable difficulty setting to make the game harder for those looking for an additional challenge ( oh and is it ever a challenge ) . Add to this Capcom increased the difficulty on Mega Man Legends 2 a few notches , and all can be forgiven here.So with all these problems , why is Legends such a good game ? Heart , and lots of it . Mix in a good story , a wonderful cast of characters ( and enemies ) , and throw in some of Capcom 's more respectable forays in voice acting department , and you got a winner . While some may claim that Legends carries a `` kiddy tone '' , I actually find this to be one of the game 's charms and strengths . Honestly , if you do n't laugh when one of the Lego Men , err , I mean Servebots messes up and angers Tron , there is something wrong . Seriously , it is n't anymore kiddy than a Mario or Zelda game ( or most of Nintendo 's gaming library for that matter ) .The other thing that makes the Legends series so great is the fact Capcom decided to quit while they were ahead . While I myself still wish they would churn out a Mega Man Legends 3 ( considering some of the unresolved issues in Mega Man Legends 2 's ending ) , at least Capcom did n't make a zillion sequels and drain the series of all it 's fun and respectability , of which they have done a fine job of doing to the original series and X series.In the end , Mega Man Legends is not a game you 'll remember for amazing graphics , razor-sharp control , or challenging quests . Instead , you 'll walk away with a overall memorable experience .	1
Megaman LegendsThis is my undisputed favorite game of all time . I bought it in 1998 or so because I had played and lovedMega Man 3for theNintendo NES System - Video Game Consolewhen I was young . This game was nothing like that game or any other Megaman games . It was in 3-D and had a story that would blow your mind . I have played through this game around 50 times and no every single part of it by heart.Graphics- 7/10The transition to 3-D for Megaman is n't an ugly one , but a decent one . Most of the trees have a 2-D look to them and a lot of characters are blocky . Still , you can tell what everything is easily and there is no slowdown at all . Not to mention , there is hardly any load time to wait through in this game.Story- 10/10You are Megaman Volnutt . Roll Casket and her Grandpa , Barrel Casket , have raised you since they found you when you were a child . Following Barrel 's footsteps , Megaman and Roll become Diggers . Diggers are people who search through ruins , infested with Reaverbots , to find parts and other things . The main thing a lot of Diggers are looking for are Refractors , which are extremely powerful crystal-like objects that power society . The world is almost entirely ocean so people must use flying machines or boats to get around . Megaman , Roll , and Barrel crash-land their flying ship , The Flutter , on an island called Kattelox . You go on to discover the island 's many secrets and fight off the treasure hungry pirates.Sound- 7/10The music and sound effects in this game are decent . Nothing will blow your mind away but nothing will annoy you to death . Some tunes even become catchy , like the Apple Market tune.Gameplay- 10/10You play as Megaman : exploring ruins , fighting pirates , and just helping people out . There are a lot of side quests you can do . You can join a secret gang , fill a museum with underground arts , help a little girl recover , play in game shows , and so much more . The main storyline has you exploring the Sub-Gate ruins in hopes to learn more about the Island 's great treasure , or disaster . While in Sub-Gates you can find all kinds of items to do things with . It 's not just in the Sub-Gates either ; you can search in other digging sites for parts . You have a primary weapon called a Buster Gun , which can be upgraded with 2 buster parts initially . These buster parts can be bought or found and change different aspects of your Buster Gun 's shooting . You have a secondary special weapon that can be equipped and upgraded as well . You will get many different special weapons in the game and one of the most fun parts of the game is upgraded your weapons to perfect ability.Difficulty- 4/10 ( Note- This is how much I like the difficulty ) Since this game is more story based , the difficulty is slight . There is hardly a time where you feel that you are going to die , minus a few bosses . Once you beat the original game , you can go back and play it on a new Hard Mode option . The game is still not that much more difficult but some of the bosses will give you more trouble . Also , to top it off , the game is n't that long . Even the player who likes to talk to every single person and gets lost often can still beat this game in less then 15 hours . That includes the main storyline and all side quests , minus special weapon upgrading . I can now beat the game on Hard Mode in around 5 hours.Overall- 10/10Despite the game being easy and not having the best graphics or sound , it 's still 5 stars . The game 's storyline and gameplay is so good that the rest does n't even matter . You 'll still find yourself going back and playing this game over and over again .	1
Mega Man Legends is a great new series for mega man . The story takes him to an island searching for energy crystals on his dig adventures . Game play is fun and easy to learn . The game has plenty of secret goodies for you too discovery adding hours of replay value . easy and fun to play but not easy enough that you 'll only spend oh ... one week or so one it . Loads of fun a most have for hardcore mega man and new mega man fans of all ages ! ! !	1
I will never forget the first time I played this game . A friend of mine had been talking about it for months when I was finally able to borrow a PlayStation and rent a copy of this game . It is really a fun Action RPG with elements of Mega Man , Indiana Jones , and Zelda .	1
Mega Man Legends revolutionized The Blue Boy wander forever.Mega 's 1st 3-D appearence.I strongly suggest that you buy this game. $ 15 is an awesome price.In the game , Mega Man is looking for the & quot ; Mother Load & quot ; , the greatest prize of & quot ; Diggers & quot ; .Mega Man also thinks that if they find it , it might help solve the mystery about Roll 's past.In the game , you can find air shoes ( the famous X & quot ; dash & quot ; ) and the famous helmet.You start with Mega Man having no helmet , but thts cool . You can also get special weapons , like the sword and a drill.I would say this , and this only ... .BUY THIS GAME NOW !	1
Game works great , amazing story that brings back childhood memories , i love it ! ! ! Awesome game to have that is old school .	1
Legends is one of the rare Megaman releases that takes place in a 3D world as opposed to the traditional 2D side scroller most MM fans are familiar with . Both Legends and Legends 2 are among some of the best made story driven 3D adventure games the PSX has in its massive and sometimes daunting library .	1
I already own this game but it 's in terrible condition . This is due to me lending it out , which is something I certainly do n't do anymore . My favorite Megaman game period , along with 2 , I had to get it again . And I have no regrets . Besides , I have 2 copies of the game now : One with only case and disc that have seen their better days and a newer complete copy that reminds me of my original copy in its prime .	1
Good game overall . Its fun and easy but rewarding . The voice overs are so cheesy that its actually funny and enjoyable to listen too . If you have not played this game yet and you enjoy mega man get this game .	1
I personally like many types of fighting games and FUN is the thing that keeps me coming back for more . A game can have pretty graphics sound great , and have all the bells and whistles in the world and still play like [ ... ] . This game might not be as pretty as the Saturn version , but who wants a Saturn ? One of the biggest flops since the future flop of Sony 's [ ... ] PS3 . A few frames missing and slowdown which I have not experienced personally are by no means reasons to dismiss a game that combines X-men with Streetfighter very well . One more thing to mention about the price . Not to insult anyones intelligence but simply supply and demand . It is discontinued , there are fewer and fewer copies available thus causing those on the open market to raise in value .	1
X Men vs Street Fighter was a big hit in the arcades everybody said that game was the s**t. The Saturn was the only home port that gave us tight controls great graphics good animation & still had tag team mode unfortunately thanks to Bernie Stolar we in the US did n't get X Men vs Street Fighter nor the 4 MB RAM cart so those of could n't get the Saturn version got this s**t on the Playstation which is bad on 2D it did n't have tight controls it did n't have beautiful graphics animations were bad sluggish speed oh NO TAG TEAM MODE ! I remember renting this version & thinking it was terrible it 's just this game was n't made for The Playstation . Now the Action Replay that bypasses region coading & uses a 1MB & 4MB RAM function I would also require a Ascii Saturn arcade stick for this game too so any owner of The Sega Saturn should get that version it 's a great fighting game that plays like the arcade .	1
i love ryu i love wolverine , ryu invented the fire ball not goku , goku who ? you could suuuuper juuump and throoow fire balls fire balls bring out your second character fire power	1
I wasent as inpressed with this game as I thought I would be . First of all , the load times are forever . Second , this game has cartoon graphics . Theird , I hate the street fighters in this game . Forth , I love the x-men ( they are absolutly fabulus ) .	1
I bought it to complete my set of Batman games for the PS1 . I would recommend it to anyone who collects Batman games .	1
The Playstation version of Riven is definantly not as good as the PC version , but it still adds up to be a great experience . Solid gameplay , crips graphics , and top-notch sound . But still falls short in some areas . Disc changing can get very tedious . That 's one reason why I recommend the DVD version for the pc . But it 's no doubt this game will suck you in and keep you sucked for a long time . Get ready to experience a whole new world .	1
ive played this game on my pc when i was really young . i thought it was actually creepy ( which i kinda still do ) . i just love the myst series and this is my favorite . i got it for ps1 to play on my ps3 and its still that awesome game i remember it as ! the case i got it in was pretty broken , but its just a case . THAT can be replaced . i really wish they still made games like this .	1
I liked this game alot , it 's challenging and it took me awhile to beat ( longer than most other games ) . I do recommend buying the strategy guide because it 's easy to miss alot . Anyways if you like the original Myst you 'll love this . Great graphics , only flaws was there was a glitch here and there but nothing major .	1
Back in 1993 , a little game called Myst appeared . Everyone went crazy for it -- it featured amazing graphics , addicting search and explore gameplay , and it was actually educational . A main part of the game was reading , so it figures that many parents were so supportive of it . It was also , though , terribly spooky at times . You could be anywhere in the world of Myst and still feel a general sense of ... well , spookiness.But Myst was in 1993 -- and even though it held well throughout several years ( which is amazingly good ) , it started to be noticed more as a classic than current technology.So how well can & quot ; Riven : The Sequel To Myst & quot ; hold up against & quot ; current technology & quot ; and the original classic ? By simply making the adventure more intresting , more long , and with more & quot ; spookiness & quot ; -- an original Myst-cliche that adds drama to the game. & quot ; Riven & quot ; is even more rewarding than & quot ; Myst & quot ; so much to the fact that it is sometimes speechless . There 's five CDs to the game -- that 's clearly enough for anyone to buy this game . Even as it starts out , you better look for clues . The developers made it so that if you do not look for enough information , you could go from one disc to another in less than 20 minutes.The graphics , while nice , are n't the best in the world . Even the control ( using the Playstation controller ) is sometimes sticky . But believe me , you 'll get used to it.It 's definetly worth a buy from any fans of the & quot ; Myst & quot ; era .	1
Except for having to switch discs all the time ! ! ! I know it 's a fact that this game was so big , you had to swap discs , that 's the only reason I did n't give it a 5 ! ! ! Other than that the game is completely immersive . It puts you right in the world of Riven . This game inspired me to purchase Myst . Part I in the series . I hope that they make more of these games for the Playstation 2 and 3 coming out . Myst III : Exile was the last game to be ported on the Playstation 2 . Come on Cyan , put more out for the Playstations ! !	1
While the game may be outdated and not as fun to play as some of the more recent titles , I ca n't fault this game because this is where it all started.On its own merit in 1995 , it was a smash-box hit and everybody was ahhed by the graphics , 3d environments , and the musical score . Back then , we were used to Super Mario World and Final Fight . This was something completely different . No one cared about the flaws the game had back then . It was par for the course.Now , in 2012 , a whole 17 years later ( really ? that long ago ... ) , a person can easily recognize the flaws of gameplay , sound , and playability . Sound effects are lo-fi , almost like comparing a cassette to a CD . The soundtrack is still amazing though , as if it were mapped on an entirely different bit format . Playability , there is one overall mode - the 1P Arcade mode ( unless you count options and 2P ) . Every successful completion of the game with a character unlocks a new character to choose - the same one you fight in round 8 . After that , you have all of the characters and there 's not much else to do . There 's no team battle , no survival , just ... 1P Arcade . So it works for 1995 . The ending movies are pretty bad , all having the same soundtrack and really blocky ugly CGI . Of course in retrospect , this WAS 1995.The movies never got better in the series until much later , but they did improve some.Overall , Tekken deserves a place in your PSX collection , right next to 2 and 3 . You wo n't play it often because Tekken 2 covers all of those bases and more . So to me , at least , this game is merely a collection piece .	1
The first time I played this game I was amazed by the sheer quality coming out of this game . The grahics were absolutly incredible and the gameplay was out of this world . This was all in 1995 . Now that tekken2 and tekken3 had arrived on the scene it seemed as though tekken had faded to a fairyland . Back then in junior school everyone was in conversation about all the characters and the secret ones and how you unlocked them . And know that games like tekken2 , tekken3 and soulbade coming to the playstation tekken was suddenly never an issue . All I know is that tekken was a fantastic game at launch and had also beaten virtua fighter on the saturn which was a rival to tekken . If tekken had never come out then I believe with a 100 % that none of the existing games that I have mentioned above and their sequals would have been in existance . Despite these games being in existance tekken is still a soulfighter and is the game that made namco famous on the playstation .	1
works well for me , except i ca n't get my championships to show at the end . Im not sure if that is a glitch or not .	1
Well i bought it because i wanted to collect all the tekken games ( i did : D ) and it brings back alot of memories	1
Ever since I was young , I have been in love with the Tekken series . Brings back a lot of good memories . I bought this game to bring back the memories and the fun . Though the graphics are n't as top notch at games these days are , but it 's still an entertaining game to play . If you collect either Tekken stuff or video games , this is a must own .	1
THIS GAME WAS GREAT . THOUGH IT DOES N'T COMPARE TO ITS ORIGINAL ARCADE MACHINE , THIS HOME VERSION IS NICE ANYWAY . THE FIGHTS ARE ALL FUN , THE GRAPHICS STILL LOOK FANTASTIC EVEN THOUGH THIS GAME IS NEARLY A DECADE OLD NOW , AND THE CHARACTERS ARE ALL GOOD AND THE STORYLINES ARE ALL INTERESTING . TO UNLOCK THE BOSSES [ WHICH IS THE MAIN THING ] , YOU HAVE TO BEAT THEM ALL WITH THEIR ALREADY AVAILABLE COUNTERPARTS . THE FIRST TIME YOU BEAT HEIHACHI [ WHICH IS THE MAIN BOSS FOR THIS GAME ] , YOU GET HIM UNLOCKED . BUT THE REST OF THEM , YOU HAVE TO PLAY AS THE COUNTERPARTS TO GET THEIR BOSSES . EVEN WITH THE PLAYSTATION 2 AND X BOX AND STATE OF THE ART SYSTEMS LIKE THAT ON THE MARKET , MANY OF THE GAMES THEY PUT OUT TODAY CA N'T COMPARE TO CLASSIC GAMES LIKE THIS ! THIS IS ONE OF THE ALL-TIME GREATEST FIGHTING GAMES EVER AND I DARE SAY THIS MIGHT BE THE BEST OF THE TEKKEN SERIES . EVEN HAS GREAT MUSIC .	1
Never actually owned the original Tekken but I played it . Since I 'm the best Tekken player in the universe , I 've decided that I want to own the game that started it all ... .	1
From the cool first cutcene to the classic music that plays while picking a character , you know this is special.Do n't just button mash , learn the combos because this is the only game ( out of 100 ) that has made me curs at the TV . If you 're a beginner , start of with someone with fast kicks like marchial Law and not Jack 2 . BUY THIS because it 's an ABSOLUTE CLASSIC .	1
I really like playing this game with my son . He has so much fun with it .	1
all i can say is that this game is a classic , possibly the best game ever made for the playstation 1 .	1
Well , I just recently bought this game again , after finding it broken from unkown causes quite a few years ago . People keep on saying , `` Tekken 2 has HORRIBLE graphics and the gameplay is horrible ! `` , To those people , did you ever think that this game came out during the 90 's and was probably awesome graphics back then ? If you 're a fan of good fighting games , I reccomend this . It has lots of characters , fair graphics , and is a good collectible for your Tekken collection .	1
the cd worked for about 4 days and then ... BAM ! ! it was skipping like crazy , it froze wen i picked Jack-2 or Kunimitsu , and now it wont come on at all.IT WAS A PRETTY CRAPPY COPY	1
Ever since I was young , I have been in love with the Tekken series . Brings back a lot of good memories . I bought this game to bring back the memories and the fun . Though the graphics are n't as top notch at games these days are , but it 's still an entertaining game to play . If you collect either Tekken stuff or video games , this is a must own . This sequal is too good to miss out on . Buy it before it 's gone for good .	1
THIS GAME WAS A VERY GOOD GAME . BUT THIS AI N'T AS GOOD AS TEKKEN 1 . LIKE ITS PREDECESSOR , HAS GREAT GRAPHICS , GREAT LOOKING MOVES , AND GREAT BOSSES TO UNLOCK , WHICH GIVES YOU A REASON TO WAN NA WIN THE GAME WITH EVERY CHARACTER . THE MUSIC IS GREAT HERE TOO . THIS IS A DEFINITE GEM . GET THIS AND ITS PREDECESSOR FOR THE ULTIMATE GAMING EXPERIENCE ! !	1
Though this review may be 14 years 2 late , n my opinion TK2 is the best of the PS1 Tekken games.From the cool fmv intro 2 the ending credits TK2 is by far the best looking/sounding 3D fighting game on the ps1 console.TK3 backgrounds , music , fmv cinemas , light source shading , animations/combos just does'nt measure 2 the standards set by this 1996 classic and it was release 2 years later , go figure !	1
I remember Tekken 2 being one of my first fighting games I have ever played , and one that I kept coming back to . It was n't just the nostalgia that kept me coming back , but the overall gameplay as well . Almost everything about this game was done right , and there is very little to complain about.Tekken 2 takes place 2 years after the events of the first Tekken . The plot is n't very well developed and is n't really involving , but everything else more than makes up for it . The graphics ( for the time ) were amazing and the animations were also nicely done . The roster includes 24 characters who are all unique and feel very well balanced . The game is very accessible and almost anyone can pick up this game and get a pretty decent grasp on it . The controls are simple and intuitive , and I always believed that this control scheme ( each button controls a limb-ex . left punch , right punch ) is one of the best for fighting games.For modes , you have your basic arcade mode which you complete to unlock new characters . You also have a vs. mode , a team battle mode ( which is very enjoyable ) , a survival mode , a time attack mode , and a practice mode . All of these modes offer allot of replayability as it is easy to dump countless hours into any of these modes.The combat system is still excellent to this day . The amount of combos that each character can do is pretty substantial and you will discover new moves without being too overwhelmed . There also are n't really any cheap tactics unlike some of the more recent iterations of tekken ( such as excessive juggling ) .Overall , this game is one of the best fighting games that I have ever played . With plenty of characters to learn , plenty of modes to choose from , amazing looking backgrounds , and a terriffic combat system , there is no reason to skip this game . If you still have a ps1/ps2 , BUY THIS GAME . I recommend this game wholeheartedly , and you wo n't regret it at all .	1
This is my family , s favorite fighting game . From my six year old daughter on up to my 10yr . old son they love this game . The graphics along with the sounds and moves are excellent also , there is a great character selection to choose from .	1
The sequel to the very popular Tekken , Tekken 2 takes everything that the original had and expands upon it . More characters , more levels , more moves , Tekken 2 is a classic and should be in the library of any fighting game lover.The combat in Tekken is one of best ever . There are so many possible combinations , it 's almost impossible to remember them all . Each Tekken gets better and better . Another thing I love about this game is the music . It suits the stages , and characters , well .	1
Tekken 2 it the huge sequel to the best selling fighter , Tekken , this game includes advanced fighting and secret characters to die for . Not only theat , but it had a plethera of gameshark codes to make the game easier . this game also introduced the 10 hit combo , the automatic win . Namco has done it again and they have done it with flying colors , this game is a must have for the fighting fans .	1
Same goes for Tekken 2 : played but never owned . Now that I 'm officially the best Tekken player period , the urge to own all of them , even the first 2 , just consumed me ... .	1
what is there to say . this game has everything you want in a fighting game ! plenty of characters to choose from and the gameplay is top notch for a ps1 game . definitely one of my favorites !	1
This game works great on my ps3 I would recommend this game for all arial fighting game thanks again love you guys thanks	1
This has got to be the best one of the playstation one series.Ca n't wait for my ps2 to arrive to continue the series , hopefully they will be better than Ace Combat 3 which was an utter disappointment .	1
This is an excellent game for spending some time on . I have played it before on a demo cd long ago so that 's why I decided to buy it . It 's about passing missions and destroying planes , bases , ships , etc . It find it very fun . The missions happen in different ambiences and time of the day which makes it more interesting . You can get new planes with different attributes according to what you want . A great title for the ps .	1
There seems to be a curse on Ace Combat akin to that on the Star Trek movies . And by that I mean that the odd numbered members of the series are forgettable , while the even numbered ( save perhaps zero , but zero is the absence of value , right ? ) are stellar . Ace Combat 6 . Awesome . Ace Combat 5 . Uneven and over too quick . Ace Combat 4 . Perfect . Ace Combat 3 . Had half the missions removed for the U.S. release . Ace Combat 1 ( Air Combat ) . Stone Age . And Ace Combat 2 ... If you 're into classic gaming and love the Playstation ( and especially if you love air combat games ) this is a definite buy . The sheer imagination that was put into this game is wonderful . You have night missions , sea missions , desert missions , high-altitude missions , ravine missions , and oh-so-wonderful city-liberation mission.I 've said it before and I 'll say it again , there 's more to graphics than just how many polygons you have and how detailed your textures are . Graphics , even low-res graphics , can and should be BEAUTIFUL . And beautiful this game is in all its Playstation polygon glory . The lighting , the jets , the far off cityscapes and the clouds in the sky , it 's all just beautiful ( to me at least ) . And better yet , unlike other air combat games of the era , everything moves at a rocketing speed . Even when you get close to the ground ( where other games look like you 're moving in slow motion ) , the game keeps a great sensation of speed.The controls are uniformly tight , utilizing the analog controls to the full . And you can bank and pitch completely upside down , something that many similar arcade-style games of the time do n't allow . The game also features a wonderful cockpit view that brings you into the experience even more . There 's also voice chatter as you go , some nice arcade style music , and full voice command briefings ( nice ) . Of course you also hear `` Bingo ! '' every time you hit a target and get a comment every time you miss too , but that 's just keeping with the arcade feel . The enemy A.I . might not be as good as you can get now , but it 's definitely good for when this game came out , and you can still get shot down if you play on hard and do n't watch yourself.In my opinion this game was the first great console air combat game . If you love arcade style air combat games and play Playstation games , you just have to get this game .	1
For the & quot ; Ace combat & quot ; initiated , this game is a lot better that the original & quot ; Ace Combat & quot ; for it 's graphics and play , although I have to say how much I enjoyed & quot ; Ace Combat & quot ; too , in the beginning . Not only have the grapics been improved but the game now includes a scannar that actually tellls you which way the enemy planes are pointing - a must for the correct deployment of missiles . Missions are plentiful and , in addition to the possibility to select a wingman ( or , indeed wing & quot ; woman & quot ; as sexual equality aware NAMCO has included ) you can even direct him or her to take on a certain part of the mission , or do the mission without support , as you wish . There are the usual night missions and canyon-runs , and plenty of planes to choose from . Game action is very smooth too . The planes available in the more advanced stages of the missions are great . An enjoyable game !	1
My first Ace combat game was Electrosphere or number 3 in 98 so 12 years later i decided to give this one a go . It 's a lot of fun , and after you configure your controls to how you like it becomes even better . Compared to 3 , this one is a bit more fast paced , but the graphics are noticeably lower in quality.The one quarrel I have , though it is a given for all pre 96ish ( i think ) PlayStation games is you ca n't use the analog sticks , which i always used in the third AC , and even though it 's just a little stick , not having it really takes away from the flying feel .	1
This is a pretty fun game . if you like hardcore killing games then this is for you . this game rocks	1
I 've played this game when I first got the Playstation around the year of 1997 . First Mature rated game and after all of these years I return back to the dungeon to claim victory . Luckily , I did . Deathtrap Dungeon is not for the gamer who is use to FPS , Fighters or 3D Games that runs on the Quake Engine . This game is for collector 's of games when they were in the early stages of become Platinum Hits in the world of gaming as of today . The game works fine but , keep in mind that when you order this game get ready for a journey and one heck of a challenge . Its not hard but , this is a game that you really need patience with .	1
If you love castles , goblins , monsters demon vixens and skeletons swinging swords this game is for you . I thought the graphics were excellent and solving the levels wasn , t difficult . Some may fine the dismemberments a little to gross , but my kids enjoyed it .	1
maybe I just am a mediocre gamer but this game is a challenge from hell.message me if you have beat this one .	1
i would recommend getting this game for many reasons you have 4 characters to choose from you can pick the route you want the levels are well designed along with the chaacters , the fighting style are also great you get to pick up weapons & use tit against them the playstation version is the best one to buy	1
This game is very fun . I have only played a demo that my cousin has but I 'm dying to pick up a copy . The demo is short and we like to come up with different themes to it like we 're going to a party at the building at the end of the demo . This game is kind of funny . Some of the enemies are pure fools . I like to run around the van with them chasing . Then I turn around and and knock the crud out of them . I like the guns and sticks that you can pick up and when you run out of ammo you can throw your gun at the enemies . That 's pretty funny too . The characters have awesome moves . I love fighting games and this is one of my favorites . If you like fighting games and games that are just plain fun , buy this game .	1
I played this game when i was a kid and forgot all about it . Then remembered it , ordered it , and have been having fun playing it .	1
Fighting Force was the wanna-be `` Streets Of Rage '' for PlayStation . If you grew up in the 90 's and owned a Sega you 'll know what I 'm talking about . The game had tons of flaws such as the lo-fidelity sound effects ( sssshhhhheeeewwwmmm ) and the blocky PC-like design of the characters . Heck , it looked like a Windows 95 platform game.There are four characters to choose from : two chicks , a big giant and the handsome one . They each have their own moves but have serious shortcomings . Smasher can take a lot of damage and deal it too ; but he 's slow as a mule . Hawk is a decent fighter but is open to a lot of hits . Alana and Mace are both quick ( alana moreso ) but are weak and fragile.The game was unduly hard due to the overhaul of the game 's engine . Back then , games overloaded easily especially if they were not rendered correctly . The load times on this game tell you there 's a lot of extra space here . An obvious pitfall is when there are many enemies/items on the screen it evokes slow command response but ONLY from players ' controllers ( remember trying to grab a guy and your player executes an 'air grab ' 1 second after you press the button ? ) . This resulted in getting beat up from 5 or more directions and having a briefcase hurled at your head . Not fun . Items were also a bother as you found that punching a guy mysteriously involved you picking up a crate first . Then you got kicked in the shin and you dropped the crate as two more guys fired shots at you and you 're spinning through the air . Fun ! Yet when you want to pull a pole off the wall you instead invoke a reverse backhand that misses and makes you look like an idiot . And for that ugly move sir you get a pipe to the face.You eventually either get frustrated with the game or you learn to live with it . The game experience for me is always bitter sweet because even though I 've learned to live with the quirks they still get in my way . The game gets progressively harder as you advance through the levels and sometimes you white knuckle your controller to keep from using a continue ( which , by the way starts you over on the level ... totally bogus ! ) . When you finally DO finish the game it seems underwhelming . You 'll see what I mean when you finish it.All in all , despite its obvious and frustrating flaws , the game is still a classic . If you do n't own it you owe it to yourself to take a trip back in time . Re-live the polygonal loading-screen glory ! !	1
Got the game . After I came home from work , it was on the kitchen table . My brother probably got to the mailbox first . I hope it is good . My little nephew wanted to play it with me .	1
Alrighty , let me just start off by saying do n't let people who play `` Final Fantsay 7 '' sway your judgement about this . While `` Final Fantsay 7 '' is an amazing game , it varies VERY HEAVILY from `` Fighting Force '' , so what some people like ( fun fighting games ) and others love ( RPG gamers ) we are at war with the worlds . It 's better to agree to disagree here . Okay , let us begin with the review . I love this game . From the very beginning where you can choose your favorite character ( Mace Daniels is my personal favorite ) , to the last moment when you deliver a crushing blow to your enemy . It is ingenius . I love how you can pick up weapons like guns and bats and that you can deliver really `` snazzy '' throws/blocks . Like people have said , it is like a `` Streets of Rage '' for the now . Let me break it down overall for you : Graphics- Compared to now , it is not up to bar . Compare it to when it frist came out , bar none ! 5/5 , although the animation can sometime slow down.Sound- Ai n't nothing more prettier than hearing your enemies bone crunch ! 5/5Control- Obviously this is the black-sheep of the family . The controls are clunky and choppy , and sometimes they interfere with the great gaming experience . Thank God for infinite health codes ! 3/5 ( ouch ) Overall- Aside from the controls being what they are , the game is a smooth ride of fun fighting and brainless beat-'em-up . I feel this game is totally undercredited , and that we need to change that . ONLY YOU CAN PREVENT FOREST FIRES !	1
this game lacked the ability to live up to name `` Tomb Raider '' its more of a `` City Raider '' half the levels deal with city-time scenery . and 80 % of the enemies are humans . more like a 007 than a Tomb Raider - but the game play is fun in the cities ( Venice ) so i cant complain too much - just wasnt feelin the whole China scene . I liked to level skip those . and the twist at the end was a lil boost - so all in all ill give it 5stars - but it lacked challenge for me - i beat it in a week . just run around and jump for the most part .	1
Tomb Raider 2 is my absolute favourite PlayStation game of all-time ! I bought the game in December 1997 , around the same time I got my PlayStation . But I never really liked Tomb Raider 2 and only managed to get halfway through the first level , before forgetting about it for a while . Four years later , in the summer of 2001 , I dug it out again and decided to give it a go with the help of a strategy guide . What a shock I got ! After the phenomenal , worldwide success of the original Tomb Raider in November 1996 , the Eidos Interactive guys put together the sequel , which , in a rare case , surpasses the original with flying colours . To save the game in the first , you had to find a crystal before continuing , wheras in Tomb Raider 2 you have the ability to save the game whenever you feel like . This comes as a great help , especially before taking off into a running jump over deep caverns and steep slopes . Lara also has much greater weaponary comapred to the last game . The first game featured Pistols , Shotgun and Uzis - that was about it . But with this game , you get weapons such as the Grenade Launcher and an M-16 Assault Rifle . While Tomb Raider 1 focused more on enemies in animal form , Tomb Raider 2 has a more worldly feel because the foes are mostly human . But the most notable change on Tomb Raider 2 is the welcome addition of vehicles . Tomb Raider featured none what so ever , but Tomb Raider 2 has a wide variety from the enjoyable speedboat in Venice and the snowmobile in Tibetian Foothills . Lara also took advantage of a make-over . The graphics where background scenery is concerned is still the same as the first game , but Lara herself has changed a lot ; her hair is no longer tied in a bun , but flows freely down her back in a pony tail . The reason this was n't featured in the first game is because the technology was n't good enough for her hair to be in a pony tail - they could n't get it to move in motion with her body ( rather silly when you think about it now ) . Lara also possesses the ability to climb certain surfaces . The improved engine also served better lighting facilities , which allowed Ms Croft the ability to wield flares whenever she finds herself in dark areas . When it comes to the levels , the highlights are Venice , Offshore Rig , Tibetian Foothills ( short but sweet - involves driving to one end of a road over pits to find a key , before driving all the way back to open a door that allows you to exit and begin the next level ) , Barkhang Monastery ( HINT : Whatever you do , DO N'T shoot the monks , they are here to help ! They will dispatch any henchmen who try to kill you so you do n't have to kill them ! Accidently shoot one , and you 'll have hundreds of monks trying to kill you ! ) and Temple of Xian.OVERALL GRADE : 10/10Tomb Raider 2 is , in my opinion , the greatest PlayStation game there has ever been . Yes , the graphics are laughable now because they have come so far since - especially on the PlayStation 2 and X-Box , but it all boils down to how enjoyable the game is . And in that category , it is still the most enjoyable and exciting game ever . Hundreds of titles try to replicate the suspense and adventure that is seen in the Tomb Raider games and fail miserably . Buy this now from Amazon - it 'd be a shame not to and to ignore it would be missing out on one of the most classic video games of all time ...	1
They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good . These games are still great for people looking for a challenge , but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order , as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next , as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises . But , even though there is n't as much actual & # 34 ; Tomb Raiding & # 34 ; in this one , it is definitely a step up from the previous version . Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara 's house is raided by a Mafia strike team . Although , does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game . ( The extended version has two more levels , but it 's only for the PC )	1
From the Great Wall of China to the canals of Venice , Tomb Raider II is the rare case in which a sequel is better than an original . In fact , I find this game to be my favorite of the series . In it the legendary Lara Croft sets out to find the Dagger of Xion . In her quest she navigates the globe , and even takes a couple of trips to strange and magical new worlds.Tomb Raider II offers significant improvements over the original , and its game play exceeds the other games that follow in the series . The game has drastically overhauled weapons and artificial intelligence . Though the puzzles are not as hard as later versions , they still are quite difficult . Lara has new moves , many new weapons , and more dangerous foes . What more could a Tomb Raider fan - or even the casual gamer - ask for ? I highly recommend this game , whether you are an avid Tomb Raider fan or somebody new to the series . I do n't believe you will be disappointed - in fact , you will probably find many hours of action filled entertainment . And if you do enjoy it , I strongly recommend other games in this series .	1
This game is great to get into and back again never mind . So the level 's are great you get to go Tibet , China , Venice and a sunken , ship . The background is not so good but it 's ok.And you get small heath and large heath packs . These heath packs will be somewhere in the game keep a good eye out for them.Arm yourself with : automatic pistols , harpoon gun , rocket launcher , M16 rifle , Uzis , shotguns , flares and more ! Kill them or be kill by : monks , yetis , great white sharks , killer eels , dobermans and more . BE CAREFUL PLEASE ! ! Your quest is for THE DAGGER OF XIAN.It 's hidden somewhere out there I know do you ? And the good news is lara is BACK !	1
I recently started re-playing this game to find that it is actually quite fun . I remember first playing this game when i was a little kid at my friends house but never gave it any attention . I just thought of it to be boring and hard . But since i remembered it , i sadly asked him if i could borrow it and he said sure , keep it . So i did . Anyways , when i started it up , i remembered everything about the first mission , very hard especially without anymore ps1 memory cards . When i finally beat the first mission . `` The Wall '' It sadly took me hours , because after those tumbling rocks after you , you got ran over easy and died . Every time you die you have to restart the whole mission , so this is what took me the most time . Soon i got on to the second mission , i got pretty far but then the disc `` old and scratched up '' quit on me . It kept freezing . I have had this problem many times before on the first mission , so i had to restart it back up again . After that i pretty much quit . This is why i keep all of my games in their cases . So they will work about 10 years later . Sorry for such a bad review but later i looked up online and watched the whole thing , well the missions in speedy time . And saw how good the game layouts and graphics were . I really enjoyed this game , well the first couple missions of it . So maybe i will buy a ps1 memory card and start to savin ' soon .	1
The first Tomb Raider was a classic in terms of its 3D gameplay , sense of exploration through massive levels , and a unique main character . The 2nd installment in the TR series is not much different . The levels are still HUGE , and exploration is still the name of the game . But this time around , the environments and enemies are more varied , there are more action-based enemy sequences than the first , and the difficulty level has been approriately increased . In terms of the level of challenge , I feel that this is the best in the series . The later Tomb Raider series felt frustrating and downright cheap at times . This one is definitely not a cakewalk , but is very possible without a strategy guide . You do n't feel as though you have to play for half an hour just to get into the next room . Progress is slow , but steady , and you do n't ever need 6 or 7 different items to move on . Progress is more based on actually getting where you want to go rather than finding the right items or hitting the right combination of switches . Some of the level designs are incredible , such as the Venice-based levels , the Opera House , the beastly Barkhang Monestary and the massive Temple Of Xian . This is the key strength of the first two TR installments , and why the more recent ones have been less inspiring . Resourcefulness and attention to the environment is extremely key , as medipacks are in light supply in this game . Also , every level has 3 secrets in the form of dragons . You do not receive the bonus items unless you find all 3 dragons in the level , making exploration even more vital in building your inventory . Finding at least 2 of the dragons in every level should be quite easy , but some levels have one especially well-hidden dragon . The gold dragons in the first two levels are remarkably difficult , but the reward of finding them ( especially the first one ) is worth it . If you did n't like the first Tomb Raider , this game wo n't change your mind . If you were blown away by the first installment ( or even the 3rd , 4th or 5th ) then this game is a real treat .	1
I recently backtracked and played all of the earlier Tomb Raider games . ( avoid Angel of Darkness . Horrible game ) TR2 is about as fun as they come . Graphics are outdated of course , but there is so much to do and to much fun to be had . The game is long , keeps your interest , has plenty of cool weapons , and a good story . I 'd love to see this game redone with today 's technology . `` 10 out of 10 '' .If you 're a TR fan and have n't played this , I 'd advise that you do .	1
Tomb Raider 2 is by far the best sequel game out right now . Lara kicks way more ... in this one then in the first . Some of the reasons why are listed here : Excellent 3D levels such as -1 .

this is a good game here and i recommend it to anyone who likes adventure type games . 10 out of 10	1
A major Tomb Raider fan , I decided to play all the games over again and finished both part one and now part two and they 're both still as great as I remember . I think both are strong and worthwhile games with great plots but Tomb Raider Two is more tough , but that 's the point of a sequel . It 's longer ( or at least it felt that way , especially when it came to the Ocean part of the game ) yet I enjoyed playing it.Both Tomb Raider One and Two have interesting plots and both are different . In Tomb Raider Two it has to deal with a Dagger that throughout the story grows more important to find and soon . You go through many different levels than you did on Tomb Raider one- including the Floating Islands- which is one weird level but very fascinating . My favorite levels were in Venice , the places in Tibet and yes the Floating Islands . Home Sweet Home level was a little scary- being attacked in her own home ! - but I thought it was a good twist . The ending itself was tougher than the first one that 's for sure , and I did say a few curse words while trying to finish the game , but eventually when I did finish I knew that it was worthwhile . I had to get a strategy guide nonetheless to beat this game , because indeed in many levels it was a little too tough for me to figure out , but then there 's no shame in getting a little help.Overall the game is more hard and challenging and just as creative in plot as part one was ( the storylines are way good ) . I enjoyed it and I recommend it to everyone who loved part one .	1
This game is amazing ! ! ! The level design and all the awesome puzzles make this game the best TR game I 've ever played ! ! This one is perfect to start if you are too young and never had a chance to play the Tomb Raider classics from PS1 . After playing this one , play # 5 , then # 1 , then # 4 . Tomb raider ... THE BEST SERIES EVER ! ! ( ESPECIALLY THE CLASSICS ONES FROM 1996 - 2000 )	1
This is one of those classic games that everyone who was a fan of Playstation 1 must own , aside from the 1st Tomb Raider of course . Got it used , but it works great .	1
A game that set the standard for the series IMO , clearly the newest one out there set the bar for the entire franchise though .	1
Ya know , I remember playing this game as a kid.I could n't find this game anywhere , and I did n't want to continue playing the Anniversary or the Windows version , so I decided to buy this game as a kid.It has a great storyline , and for everyone who likes Indiana Jones , then you 'd love this game.Pros ( or cons ) : Easy to maneuverChallenging puzzles in which you have to think ( do n't worry because it 's not like Balder 's Gate or anything that brainstorming ; ) Unique storyline involving AtlantisCons ( or pros ) : Low quality graphics ( then again it is from the PS1 , so do n't expect 128 bit graphics ; ) No music except for select portions where there are orchestral themesSurrealism/constant element of surprisePersonally , I like most of the cons but those are most of the things people I 've known complained about.Also , if anyone buys this game , then I have to tell you this : Please , if you 're gon na use cheats ... Then at least beat the game before doing so . > _ >	1
If I could have give 6 stars for this game , I would have . I played this originally when it first came out in 1996 . Back then , games such as Resident Evil and Tomb Raider were ground-breaking milestones in entertainment known as video games . I wo n't talk about Resident Evil here because everyone knows about that.Tomb Raider was the first game to give players control of a character in a true 3D environment . Sure , you had games like Doom and Wolfenstien , but they played only on a single plane with your character spinning on an axis . Tomb Raider allowed you to control Lara , the feminine version of Indiana Jones , an use the environments such as cliffs , roofs , etc . to progress through the levels . Level design in Tomb Raider is really what the game is centered around . Beautiful , stunning , breath-taking , eerie , surreal , all describe the level design here . Nothing short of ingenious.The game mechanics and control of Lara were never the best , but they were also adequate to get the job done . Lara spins on a fixed axis when the player turns left and right , and forward makes her run in the direction she is facing . Turning can sometimes be a chore , especially when the action is turned up a notch . Luckily , the circle button makes Lara do a somersault tumble , for a quick & quot ; about-face & quot ; . The shimmying and climbing from ledge to ledge and jumping has always been amazing . Combine that with sliding down angular rock formations and time jumps and grabs to ledges , and you are bound to fall in love with the action that Eidos developed ( NOTE : This kind of mechanics shined most for me in this game as opposed to all the predecessors , including Angel of Darkness for PS2 . This kind of action became less and less as the series went on , save for Last Revelation , maybe ) . The swimming sequences and puzzles are also a really wonderful treat as well.There are plenty of surprises in this game that I do n't want to give away , however , I will tell you that some of the levels in the game will stick in your memory for a long , long time after . For example , & quot ; The God Room & quot ; of St. Francis ' Folly has got to be one of the best and most memorable and beautiful levels of any game that I 've played.So why am I writing this review now , 7 years after the release date ? For a few reasons . First , being that I ca n't get the game out of my head for more than a few months . Every six months I go back to it . The second reason , is that when I bought a PS2 , I knew I would be playing the original Tomb Raider again and wanted that backward capability . And THIRD and quite possibly the most important ( and the reason I titled this review & quot ; Dear Eidos & quot ; ) is that Angel of Darkness was the single reason that I sold my PS2 for an X-Box . At first I enjoyed AOD , but the game has rampant problems . I 've always welcomed a new Tomb Raider game in my life and gave AOD more than one chance . I loved all the other PS1 Tomb Raider games , including III , which got a lot of harsh and unwarranted criticisms in my mind , but whatever . I hated AOD and want Eidos to know that . And FOURTH reason is that I repurchased the new and compact PSOne last week . I still own my Tomb Raider from back in the day . Last night I played it and the magic was back like from the first time I played it . Sure the graphics feel older , but they are by no means bad at all considering that I play games like Halo , Crimson Skies , Prince of Persia , and Rainbow Six 3 on the X-Box . There will always be a large place in my geeky video-gaming heart for this true classic.EIDOS : TAKE THE POWER BACK !	1
OH YES ... .this game is what it 's all about . Sure , it looks totally archaic now with its primitive low-polygon 3D ( cf . Lara 's Madonna-style pyramid breasts ) and jerky low frame rate - BUT WHO CARES . `` Tomb Raider '' was one of the first fully-realized 3D games , with huge environments and a camera that lets you explore them fully - something next-gen developers still seem to have a problem with sometimes - and , of course , best of all , an action hero that players across the board could instantly connect with . Yes , Lara Croft - men want her , women want to be her ... lol . Forget about her later misadventures on celluloid and ( worst of all ) the PS2 platform . Even on the PS1 , all the new innovations in graphics and AI that cropped up in subsequent TR installments could n't improve upon the originality of gameplay you have here in the debut . The puzzles , the secrets , the at-times relentless action , this game has it all.Much like Indiana Jones , we first encounter Lara as she explores some ruins in South America - allegedly the village of Vilcabamba , an actual archeological site in Ecuador , although as it appears in the game it 's more of a generic hotch-pot of pre-Columbian art and architecture . Of course you have the rolling ball traps everywhere , and of course she eventually finds a golden idol - more nods to Indy . Later she explores Las Vegas versions of Rome and Egypt , slaughtering more endangered species in the process than are even left on the planet ( PETA just loved this game ) before proceeding to - where else ? - Atlantis , which is naturally swarming with freakish and bloodthirsty mutants . All this because she 's in search of an artifact whose magical powers , if in the wrong hands , could destroy the world , or something.It 's easy to punch holes in the ridiculous plot , but that does n't affect the entertainment value - again just like with Indy , you know it 's stupid , but you 're more than willing to suspend disbelief just to go along with the wild ride . Getting through the levels is not always easy ; you 'll need to sharpen both your combat and puzzle-solving skills . There 's also a lot of replay value owing to the oftentimes diabolically-hidden `` secrets , '' which usually contain caches of weapons and the infamous `` medi-paks . `` Play this game - it 's almost like a cool retro thing to do now - and forget about everything that came after . They have a new TR in the works now but it 's got a lot of bad karma to overcome ... so far nothing has matched this original masterpiece .	1
So , this is where it all began - the original Tomb Raider . In November 1996 , Britain was changing . With the phenomenal success of the Spice Girls and the phrase `` girl power '' , there was n't a better time to bring out an all-female computer game heroine who kicked [ rear ] ! Enter Lara Croft . The game went straight to No.1 all over the world and shifted more than 10 million copies to become THE biggest selling PlayStation game of all time . Lara soon became a cultural icon , gracing hundreds of magazine covers the world over - and not just computer magazines , mainstream magazines such as Rolling Stone and Time ; undoubtedly the biggest magazine names in the world . Four sequels followed in the form of Tomb Raider II , Tomb Raider III , Tomb Raider IV : The Last Revelation and Tomb Raider IV : Chronicles . The five games have sold a combined total of 40 million worldwide and secured Eidos Interactive and more importantly , Lara Croft and Tomb Raider , a place in video gaming history as undoubtedly the greatest , most popular and enjoyable computer games of all time.The story of Tomb Raider is simple really . Lara Croft is a semi-famous archeologist adventurer and has been hired by a mysterious woman , Natla ( last name unknown ) to search the globe for an ancient artifact , known as the Scion , that is beleived to have come from the lost city of Atlantis . Lara sets off on her travels to find this artifact but before she can find it , she must search other areas of the world to find clues and hints that will open the way forward to her ultimate prize . Around halfway through the game , while uncovering clues about the artifact in question , Lara also unveils the truth about Natla ; a story told through amazing cut-scenes . The storyline is intriguing to say the least and keeps you on the very edge of your seat as you beg to know more , yet never for the game to end.The game begins with simple , pedestrian levels for newcomers to get to grips with the controls . The enemies are only small in the first few levels ; bats , dogs etc . that can be eliminated with a single shot of Lara 's Pistols - a weapon that she has with her always that features an unlimited amount of ammo . The game has a massive 16 levels that will keep you playing for months - it took me 10 months to complete . In fact , I finished the week Tomb Raider II came out so once I 'd finished with the first , I spent the next 10 months playing the second one ! This has been a regular oocurance and has resulted in me playing all five Tomb Raider games for around 6 years without a break ! I remember the days when I bought this game ... I was only 10 and it scared me to death ! The enemies may not look very real , but remember that controlling Lara is ! You control her every move so her life is in your hands ! At the time the game was released , the graphics were unbelievable and the scenery breathtaking . The former is not so much now , but the latter still stands . Graphics in computer games have come a very long way since 1996 , but half an hours ' play on Tomb Raider with Ms Croft , and its superior excellence shines through . The final levels are set in and around Atlantis , and are classic moments in video gaming history . From the rocky cliffs of Asia , to the hot muggy forests of South America and the haunting and eerie lost island of Atlantis , there 's something here for everyone . Buy it now ! OVERALL GRADE : 10/10All in all , Tomb Raider is the ultimate PlayStation game . Everything about this game is so enchanting and memorable . The atmosphere , the sounds the animals make , the noises Lara makes when falling off a rock , the music that cues to tell you something exciting is about to happen - everything ! This is a true classic in video gaming history that deserves all the critical praise it recieved 6 years ago . If you have n't got Tomb Raider in your PlayStation games collection , it is not complete . Only when you purchase all 5 Tomb Raider games will your collection be complete . With the soon-to-be released Lara Croft Timb Raider VI : The Angel Of Darkness , all six Tomb Raider will keep me playing for decades , literally . I will still be playing Tomb Raider when I 'm 60 years old , and I 'm sure I 'll not be the only one ...	1
Despite awkward controls that seem to be designed more for a computer than a Game System ( and get used to it , because that lasts until the PS2 era -- aka , the sixth game in the series ) this has to be one of the funnest games of all time . It gives a challenge on multiple levels & inspires you to keep playing to find out what happens next as things get progressively more dangerous and more bizarre . Was re-made as Tomb Raider : Anniversary , but I 'd prefer the original any day .	1
From the ruins of Rome to the futuristic setting of Atlantis , Tomb Raider takes the gamer through a variety of wonderful worlds . Unlike its sequels , it stays in the tombs and out of other settings . I believe that it is one of the best games ever made , and it certainly is a classic . However , I believe that its sequels in many aspects overshadow it.The scenery in Tomb Raider is better than most games , although it is mostly cubed and flat . The game play and plot are wonderful , and the graphics and sounds are acceptable . However , the artificial intelligence enemies are less than intelligent , and the gamer is often left feeling underestimated with the ease of some of the puzzles . Laura 's moves are limited , and the weapons supply is less than perfect.I would recommend this game to any fan of the Tomb Raider series and to the average gamer . However , I do feel that other versions have better qualities . Tomb Raider II offers wonderful AI and is perhaps the best for a gamer seeking combat . Tomb Raider III combines the better aspects of the previous two , and Tomb Raider : The Last Revelation offers the best plot and character mobility . If you are looking to stay in the tombs , or if you are not into puzzles , stick with this game . However , do n't miss out on the other great qualities the Tomb Raider series offers .	1
Like I 've said before , Tomb Raider will always stand as one of the most influential games of all time . Back in 1996 , the only competition in this genre was Mario 64 . Nowadays , every other game is a 3d adventure `` in the vain of Tomb Raider '' .The game is very solid . Well placed and thought provoking puzzles . Some nice action , great graphics which still hold up today , and lots of fun . The only complaint is the lack of a decent ending , and that I have to shoot a fellow human at least 60 times in order to kill him . How untrealistic is that ? While TR 2 is the best in the series , this one will be the most remembered.Story : 6/10Graphics : 8/10Sound : 7/10Fun : 8/10	1
God , it was ages ago when I last played the original & quot ; Tomb Raider & quot ; . The first time I played it , maybe six years ago , I was amazed and frightened . I was frightened because of the very first level . You know , the awry music , dark caves , and vicious bats , wolves and bears . That will always be my first memory of playing & quot ; Tomb Raider & quot ; . Even though it 's dated now , it still lives up to its name despite several sequels and dissapointing movies.What really made this game famous , and made Playstaion fun , was the goddess Lara Croft . She 's absolutely gorgeous ! You play the adventrous archaeologist in a quest to recover an ancient artifact ; Croft travels the world in style , from Peru to Egypt and to the lost city of Atlantis.I think that 's the story for the game . I lost track since I have n't played this game for awhile . But what was original about this game was n't really Lara 's beauty , it was the gameplay . The gamer has to solve complexed puzzles , battle hard enemies ( including dinosaurs ! ) and go through hidden rooms and collect treasures from ancient cities.There is also a good amount of weapons for Lara , including her trademark dual pistols . There is also some health packs in case she gets hurt , in fact she gets hurt alot ! No human being could ever do the things she does ! The very physical Lara jumps impossible feats , does handstands and survives in very dangerous situations . She 's a female Indiana Jones ! Anyway , & quot ; Tomb Raider & quot ; is an entertaining game . It has good graphics , solid gameplay , and Lara Croft is hot ! But the & quot ; Tomb Raider & quot ; series has lost track of its self . The gameplay is all ready becoming old , and its lack of innovation has n't made gamers happy . Including myself . Only part 2 is the best sequel . But the original game that made Lara Croft famous is a must own game for every classic game collection .	1
Tomb Raider was one of the first games I completed and it was tough . Really challenging throughout and educational , one of the most intriguing and fun games to pass while shooting at random things and at Dinosaurs and Bears and other animals , really great !	1
Brought this game for myself , it brought back memories when I was 6 playing this all summer long . Game came as described and fast also .	1
It 's great to play if you have nothing to do well anyaway . The level 's are so cool it 's get 's better each time you go to a new level . Each level have something you must do before you go on . There are alot of little places that you can fine little small heath pack 's get those you will need it because there is always someone trying to stop you and kill you O , if you fine anything useful get that too.Sometimes the informate is right there in your face you just got to look that 's all.This was my only game that I own for my playstation . That the time I did't know if I sould play it or leave it alone will I play it and you know what , I like it for once a woman is doing the thing and I said it 's about time , do you know what I mean ? ? Well go have fun I did . Take your time and do it right I did and I got good at .	1
Ive had Tomb raider since July and this game is off the meters ! ! When I first played it , I was frustrated with the controls , but once u learn them , this game is the best ! ! ! The worlds are long and puzzling , but its never too hard to finish . The action and suspense make u feel like its a movie . I reccomend this to anybody who likes action or 007 fans like me . You WILL love it , trust me .	1
I absolutely love Tomb Raider . It is definitely my favorite game of all time . It has everything you need to make a wonderfully fun game . There is action and adventure , thriller , problem solving , and an entertaining story line . I love the challenge of the problem solving . It is n't a game you can finish in a couple hours , but take a long time to get through all of the different puzzles . You definitely get your moneys worth with play time on this game . It will always keep you thinking . I could n't ask for a better game .	1
I had to go back and play this game after playing ( and loving ) Tomb Raider Anniversary . Playing Anniversary and then going back to the original really makes you appreciate just how awesome this game was . The level design was just amazing with all the different areas you get to explore . I have n't played the original since it first came out so I did n't realize just how much Crystal Dynamics took from this game . They took a lot . Some of the level designs are almost identical . The biggest difference between the old and the new is the difficulty . Anniversary is way easier . But not because the puzzles or enemies are easier . It 's because of the controls . Back in Tomb Raider 1 , the controls were pretty terrible . But what do you expect from a game breaking new ground in the world of 3D ? So I 'll over look it and give it a 5 out of 5 .	1
I have n't played Tomb Raider 1 in a long time but a month or so ago I found it at a used cd store and bought it . I just finished the game and am still thrilled at how exciting and tough this game still is . The plot is interesting enough for you to continue caring for the story and Lara Croft makes a fun character to use to get to your next destination . She is strong , knows how to carry her weapons , jump great heights and is truly fearless when it comes to dinosaurs , bad guys and even messed up creatures she meets up with in the end . You have to constantly be kept on your toes throughout the game and the settings themselves are yes very old compared to nowadays improvements but for back then were well done and even nowadays not bad at least to me . This game is a fun challenge and I recommend it to anyone interested in adventure games for Lara will take you on great journeys in this game . My favorite is where she is facing a Sphinx- like statue- now that was a fun level.Tomb Raider is one of the greatest storylines ever created and that is why it is so popular even nowadays . The older stuff is better though , aka like 1- 4 of the Tomb Raider series is the best to me- everything after 4 seems to have gone downhill . Angel of Darkness honestly I could n't even finish it was so bad . So take my advice and try out the older version of Tomb Raiders first , they are much better and more exciting .	1
This is the best game I have yet to play . It took me six months to finally defeat , figure out and fight my way to the end of this game . This game was like a very suspenseful movie that I was controlling . Many times in the game I was actually sweating from fear . You don , t know what , s waiting for you around each corner , waiting to jump out at you and scare the crap out of you . Even my family and onlookers were startled or to afraid to play this game because of the realism captured in enormous worlds and creepy CD sounds .	1
If you are a fan of TR you 're gon na love to have this one in your collection ! ! The graphics are better though on the pc version ...	1
The original Tomb Raider was a landmark game for the Playstation and the start of a very long running series . It holds up well , but is a definite acquired taste.Tomb Raider begins with adventurer and treasure huntress Lara Croft being hired by business woman Jacqueline Natla to search an ancient cavern in Peru for a piece of the Scion , an ancient talisman of great power . However , after finding the piece , Lara is betrayed by Jacqueline 's men . Now it 's a race across the world to find the remaining pieces of the Scion before Jacqueline attains its mythical power . Tomb Raider is an early Playstation game , and unfortunately the graphics have n't aged very well . Although many set pieces in the game are very impressive all the levels tend to feel very samey . Despite this the game 's length is impressive . There are over fifteen massive levels with hidden caches of ammo and first aid packs , giving you a great sense of exploration throughout the game . Lara moves in a very stiff fashion . Her controls are tank-like and You have to hold down a button for her to walk . She takes very long jumps , but running jumps have a delay that requires you to plan your jumps ahead of time in most cases . Fortunately there is a training mission where Lara instructs you on how to play in her home . The game is primarily a puzzle platformer . Each level contains a series of puzzles that will test your problem solving skills.Scattered throughout the many ruins and caves are vicious animals and hired goons all chomping at the bit to impede your progress . This is where combat comes into play . Lara starts off the game with twin pistols that have unlimited ammo . Through out the game you will find a variety of firearms , however these weapons do have limited ammo , but the pistols ensure you will always have a fighting chance in battle.The last gameplay feature to talk about is the process of saving your game . The PC version of the game allowed the player to quicksave wherever they wanted . The console versions of the game on Playstation and Sega Saturn do not have this luxury . You can only save with the use of crystals that are placed along the path you are intended to follow . Unfortunately , once a crystal is used it is gone . This makes it really difficult when you 've got a very long stretch ahead of you and not much health . Some areas have multiple crystals forcing you to carefully plan how often you save.This game has many flaws , but it is a very rewarding experience . I would recommend the game for those expecting a challenge . The later games in the Tomb Raider series ironed out many of the issues experienced here . If you 're curious about the beginning of the franchise you wo n't be disappointed , but maybe a little stressed.For classic PC gamers I 'd recommend Tomb Raider : Unfinished Business . This is the original game plus two bonus missions with two new levels a piece .	1
The story line for both the orginal Tomb Raider and Tomb Raider Anniversary are the same . I would consider the old Tomb raider is more harder then the new Tomb Raider Anniversary . If you like better graphics and such get Tomb Raider Anniversary . If you like harder challenge get the old version . Either one is both good on game play .	1
The first installment in the series , turned many heads and imaginations of many . A good flick if you 're bored and looking for an adnventure . Can tend to be frustrating .	1
This takes back memories when I first played Tomb Raider . It 's both chalenging and fun . Its remake is just added stuff and newly improved stages .	1
This is my 400th review & I really ca n't believe the past 3 or 4 years have gone by so quickly . I mean almost 4 years ago I came on here & started with video game reviews then I ranted on movies that I hate which turned into reviewing movies I love . The 8 months on this account I have been reviewing old wrestling show I reviewed a lot of the old NWA-WCW s Pay Per Views I have just started with reviewing WWF PPV 's this past Friday I reviewed Survivor Series 1995 . I 'm going to review In Your House 5 Seasons Beatings soon . WWF Warzone released inj July of 1998 for The Playstaion & Nintendo 64 . This game I feel gets undeserved flack it 's not as good as The THQ games on The N64 like The WCW games or the 2 WWF games or any of the THQ games on The Playstion or PS2 . But this game is better than most of the wrestling games put out by AKKLAIM previously . This game & WWF Attitude were the only good wrestling games put out by AKKLAIM . I have The Playstaion version which was the version I played the most . I bought it again recently cause my N64 does n't work anymore . So getting into the game you have Challenge mode which is a career mode where you go after The WWF Intercontintal Championship & The WWF Championship . When you play through it you have wrestlers challenge you to a rematch it will be either a normal match a weapons match or a cage match . Thankfully when I as Stone Cold I did n't have to face Ahmed cause The Playstaion check out fun with Ahmed on youtube . If you do win The WWF title you can keep on defending it & opponets become harder & can evade your attacks . Then you have normal versus mode where you fight a random opponet the wrestlers you can play as are Stone Cold Steve Austin , Shawn Michaels who retired for 4 years before this game came out due to a back injury . Ahmed Johnson who left The WWF before this game came out . The Rock who was in between being Rocky Miavia & The Rock . Bret Hart who as we all know was in WCW when the game came out . But it is fun to play as Bret Hart the most easy wrestler to play as . Owen Hart . Farooq , Goldust , Undertaker , Kane , Mankind , Ken Shamrock , The British Bulldog who left The WWF in late 97 due to what happend in Montereal . Mosh & Thrasher . So this is more like the late 1997 roster but no wrestling game I 've played had a totally up to date roster . You have tag team mode it would 've been nice if you could 've went for The WWF Tag titles . You have weapons match which is a no disqualification match . Cage match where you face an oppent in a Steel Cage match . You just have to beat your oppent up until there health meter is in the red & climb over it . The Nintendo 64 version had Royal Rumble & Gauntlet Matches . You have training mode where you can learn the moves come up with stradegy when you play as whoever you want . The only problem is you ca n't do your finishing move in training mode . Look online how to do the finishing moves & there not really that difficult to pull off . You have create a wrestler mode back then it was neat now it 's just not that great . But you can listen to the wrestlers enterance themes you can listen to them in The Bio 's as well & The Playstaion version had the real themes while The 64 had chip tunes but they really were n't bad at all . You have options mode where you can save the game adjust the difficulty set the time of the match . You have the basement where all the unlockables are at if you want you have to play through on medium or hard with a certain wrestler to get stuff unlocked . I enjoy playing through as Austin Bret Hart is fun to play as cause of all the ways he has to work the legs . I mean if you 're just getting started playing this game then guys like Bret Hart , Owen Hart , The British Bulldog & Shawn Michaels would be the best for beginners . Undertaker & Kane are also fun to play as . There is an option where you can check your stats that shows how many wins & losses you have . I do like that if you or your opponet repeats the same move over & over again the crowd will boo you . But when you do different moves & bigger moves then they will cheer you . Although I do n't think AKKLAIM knows what a pump handle slam looks like cause a belly to back suplex is called in this game . You get commentary by Jim Ross & Vince McMahon . Warzone is a great game when you learn how to play it , it is pretty fun . The only problems I had was tag team mode feels like it 's broken at times . Like you partner will just stant there & let the pin be broken sometimes the opponet wo n't break the pin & let his partner be pinned . I wish they would 've included The Royal Rumble in The Playstion version . More wrestlers could 've been put in the game The Road Warriors who returned to The WWF in 1997 guys like D'Lo Brown & Kama from The Nation Of Domination & I wish Brian Pillman could 've been put in the game . If I ever get WWF Attitude then I 'll review it .	1
I enjoy the shows and PPVs . this one is a great one to get if you like wwf wrestling .	1
Use to play this as a kid and when I played it , it brought back all kinds of memories from my childhood . Definitely a game to have if you are or were a fan of wrestling .	1
I played this game a lot when I was little . It was always fun and I enjoyed it . The music in the background , the colors , the graphics ; its all great . The coolest thing is that this game is one of a kind , and it is really a good one to add to any Nintendo 64 collection . Gameplay is easy and overall a really awesome game !	1
This was n't widely released in America though those who have played it swear by it as being just as fun as Mario Kart 64 . I agree with this comparison . However this has some fun twists that Mario Kart 64 lacks . One such twist is that laps occur when you get to the bottom of the hill and jump back on the lift . This can cause for some HILARIOUS chaos ! If two racers have a good lead on opponents but are trying to bump each other out of the way to jump on the next lift chair , it can give other people a chance to catch up and possibly sneak onto a chair first if their opponents knocked each other over . I love this dynamic ! Because it makes it more than just your average Mario Kart racing clone.Other features include the ability to buy new boards and perform aerial trick to earn extra cash . Money earned during a race can also be used to `` buy '' weapon items encased in boxes littered throughout a course . I also ought to mention the music ; it 's wonderful ! ! ! It features bubbley techno music reminiscent of dance/pop groups like Aqua . You 'll dig the energy the music provides.If you are a fan of Mario Kart 64 style crossfires , I think you 'll find this is a unique addition to your N64 collection .	1
Snowboarding games are a dime a dozen these days , so it 's nice when a good one comes along . Although it 's rare to see a snowboarding game play out like Mario Kart , it makes for a really fun game . You play as one of 6 grade school children , collect items and weapons , knock off enemies with these items and weapons , do tricks , and get money while trying to win the race . Even though the childish characters may intimidate many who see this game , this still is a great game . The game looks pretty nice for N64 standards , the controls are tight , the sounds are good and the music is very catchy . This game also uses great ideas , such as saving money to upgrade your snowboard or playing on really wacky ( but really enjoyable ) courses . In fact , some of the courses have no snow on them ! But that 's the fun of this game : getting to snowboard down unimaginable terrain , while at the same time , hitting your opponents with pie-pans , bombs , rocks and other items . It releases some kind of childhood glee deep in your brain that I just ca n't explain . But it 's not all fun and games though . There are some problems . First , is the game 's image . Many are really going to be turned off by the childish nature of this game , though I liked it so much , I did n't care . The biggest problem is that you need a Conroller Pak to save your data . The real gripes here is that there is no battery backed memory option along with the Controller Pak use and since the game requires 121 of the 123 pages in the Controller Pak , you 'll need to spend more money getting more Controller Paks if you have other games that require it also ( Mystical Ninja starring Goemon , Rugrats In Paris ) or games where you want to save data for safe keeping ( Wave Race 64 , Perfect Dark ) . But even with these issues , the game is still really fun and worth playing . If you like it and still want more , try its sequel , Snowboard Kids 2 . But try the original first to see if you like the style of play . I 'll bet dollars to donuts that you 'll enjoy it , though . Great Job , Atlus .	1
I liked all of the tricks you can play being a kid . I like being a kid rather than an adult sometimes . The boards look cool .	1
If you like Mario Kart 64 , then you will absolutely love this game ! Its sort of a rendition of Mario Kart 64 , but instead of riding karts , your riding snowboards . Now in my biased opinion , I love snowboarding games , and this one was a classic among my friends and me.I recently played it again and noticed several pros and cons that made it such a good game . It had hilarious sound effects , great controls , a few varieties of boards to chose from , and solid looking graphics . It is also fun to get power ups and shoot down your friends to get in the lead . What 's really cool about this game is the chair lift at the end of the run . To get back to the top of the mountain you have to go up a chairlift , but the chaos that happens to be the first person to ride the chairlift is hilarious . The only thing that turns people off from the game is that there are only four riders to choose from , and they 're all little kids . In other games like Mario Kart , there is more characters to chose from , but the character choices are only a minor con . It also has an incredibly babyish look towards it that can be a slight turn off for older kids . But once you can `` read past its cover '' the game can be so much fun to play with friends and family . It is almost nothing like the immature style the game gives off.Overall , I rate this game a solid 4.5 out of 5 because it is fun and exciting , and in my opinion , better than Mario Kart 64 .	1
I have to admit something , I love the way this game looks ! It is spectacular in the graphics sense , but the story just left me out to dry . The orginal command and conquer storyline was way better . The GDI missions are a joke in this game and I have to say it ... NOD RULEZ ! The NOD missions are very fun to look at and play especially the evil HAL computer that talks to you in the cool voice . The game play units are completely unbalanced ! On GDI side , all you have to do is amass a huge army of Tank Mechs and you can destroy any base no matter how fortified it is . On the NOD side , amass a huge army of 30 mobile artillery and nobody can stand in your way . The game is worth buying to see how it looks , but the gameplay is horrible and some of the missions are close to impossible which may frustrate some novice players . Ok Westwood you have provided the interface , now quit slacking and give us a good story !	1
Tiberian sun is an example of how a real time game should be . Great campains where you can be either Nod or GDI . This game also has great skrimishes . Where you can play the computer on a diffrent level of difficulty and can play anwhere from 1-7 enimies . With alot of diffrent units and buildings this game is not to be missed .	1
This was the first C & amp ; C game I ever purchased . I got this game when I was n't playing much else apart from EVERQUEST , upon a friends recommendation . I was n't to familiar with the C & amp ; C franchise of RTS games from Westwood . Now I am a fan of the series.If you do n't know , TIBERIAN SUN is a RTS about two military forces at odds with one another . The evil NOD , that wants to rule the world , while the honorable GDI wants to protect the world . The single player missions are on two discs . One is GDI and the other disc is the NOD single player missions . Both are quite fun and it helps you to learn the gameplay . I ca n't say I liked the full-motion-video sequences , but they are quite funny in an unintentional way ! The online multiplayer is where the real fun of TIBERIAN SUN is at ! There just is no way to describe winning a long 2 hour match online and not getting booted off ! This is a good value for the money . It may not be as great as AGE OF EMPIRES or STARCRAFT , but TIBERIAN SUN is fun nonetheless . Enjoy !	1
Loved it ! ! ! One of the best games in this genre . Good story , and even has the guy from the first Terminator who protects the woman ( ca n't think of his name ) as one of the main actors in the cutscenes , and James Earl Jones . High production values . The game play is top notch .	1
I am writing this review from what i thought of it before red alert 2 came out . this is a great game with a pretty good story line , though it lacks graphics . Westwood online ( the multiplayer sever ) is also very good . if your lookign to buy a good RTS i recomend red alert 2 , but if you do n't want to spend the money on RA @ this is still a great game .	1
Well , it seems that those idiots who gave TS a low rating was because they thought TS reused Red Alerts units . That is completely wrong . TS is set in a futuristic world with advanced units . Red Alert was a PREQUEL to the original C & amp ; C and was set throughout the Cold War . TS does not use standard tanks and the new units were made as it would have been seen in the year TS took place which was 2030 . This is especially true with GDI and there titans , disruptors , firestrom defense , rpg towers , MMK II and a whole lot more . Nod has has the cyborgs , underground units , and and the banshee aircraft etc . Now , are these the same units from RA , i dont think so . Westwood retained a couple of units from the original C & amp ; C such as the devil 's tougue and light tank but they upgraded the functions of these units to please gamers . Nothing from this game was copied from RA- trust me . As for Starcraft some say its better than TS and some say it isnt . I personally hate that game . Its way more complex to understand than TS simple interface , no deformidable terrain , you have to RIGHT CLICK to deselect units ( very awkward ) , structures take extremely long to build - as well as units , those same structures look like they have legs ( terran barracks and engineering bay ) . I also have no idea what the storyline is about ( no real actors - jus bad FMVs ) .I could name a whole lot more but it would take up too much space in this review . The only single thing i like is the marine responses which give u a good laugh now and then but it still gets repetitive after a while which is common in almost all RTS games . Sure , Starcraft is an original game with new features that pleases people just like the old C & amp ; C. some people ask for too much in a sequel and when they find what they havent been looking for , they disgrace the game . We 'll see what sequel is in store for Starcraft but for now , if youre a serious fan of C & amp ; C 's then pick up a copy of TS- you 'll find an intersting game with a whole bunch of new features including some old time favs that would have remembered .	1
Okay I admit it , the two main reasons I bought this game are James Earl Jones and Michael Biehn , whom I believe are bloody great . However , the game in itself is lots of fun . I 'm making my way through the GDI games at the moment , and having a good time !	1
This is this is the first strategy game I have ever liked that I played , so maybe I 'm partial to it ... but I love it ! I do n't understand why some people are so crushed when their & quot ; favorite & quot ; game series puts out a bad game . It 's not that big of a deal . For all you Red Alert buffs , Red Alert 2 will be out soon so chill out for a minute . There are a ton of different strategies to play this game with so it becomes extremely addictive . Once you get the basics down ... the sky is pretty much the limit on strategies you can use so this adds replay value to the game . It will definitely keep you busy until the next installment by Westwood . The online play is great and easy to use . I have n't even played the single player game because I just ca n't get enough of the online play . So unlike the other people who are saying they hate it ( but they probably still play it often ) , I like it an awful lot .	1
I just do n't understand those who want to give this game low marks . This is a game that when modified with the numerous free online downloads is as good a game as any out there.To start this game is a sequel to command and conquer not red alert which is the much more popular westwood game . That was a problem for some who just assumed that westwood would come out with a red alert sequel first . Never the less there are features in this game that improve upon the original . The original CnC did not allow for skirmish play against the Al opponent only missions . This game does allow multiplayer play and the Al is very competitive at the more difficult levels . There are some other small extras as well such as more colors to choose from and the oppportunity to make a map right at the game menu . Just set your specifications and it makes a map that 's meets those specs . One new feature i love is the option for a deployable mcv . This allows you to start a base and then move your command center to another area . This game is also much more strategic then the originas CnC . The maps are spectacular with many cliffs , ridges and rivers and lakes . No game has better maps and terrain . I wish i could say the same about the units though . While the structures are creative and attractive the units look down right bizarre and cartoonish . Some may like this but i do n't . The colors of the units and structures are rich and pleasant but some units are too strange looking to enjoy . The infantry look alright but the tanks take some getting used to . Another unfortunate aspect of the game is that the nod is given the more strategic interesting units . The gdi has more size and firpower while the nod is more sneaky with it 's burrowing apcs and missles . One feature i like is the infantryman . The disc throwers for the gdi or the rocket guys for the nod have armor that makes them much more competitive in battles than a rocket guy or grenade guy in red alert . You ca n't just run over these infantrymen . A group of 10 disc throwers can do serious damage to a camp if allowed to sneak in or they can quickly do away with a harvester . The basic play is bascially the same as CnC or red alert but there are enough new features here to make it a worthwhile purchase at $ 20.Overall i would rate the stock tiberian game that comes from the store as a 3.7 to 3.8 stars . A good solid game . What makes this a truly great game is the numerous free downloads and upgrades available both at westwood.com and many other sites . On the program menu for the game is an upgrade option from westwood that helps to work out some of the bugs and improves the game . In addition there are literally dozens of web-sites devoted entirely or in part to this game that provides an incredible array of free downloads that provide game modifications , new maps , units and game tips ect . Also included are opportunites to join klans and clubs , things that really enhance the enjoyment of the game . One download called & quot ; resistance 2.0 & quot ; will add 50 % more speed and firepower and will double the number of units and structures . You can find this download at tsden.com . It is these additional modifications and options that convert a good game into a fantastic game . These upgrades and downloads are absolutely free and require very little time , effort or computer savyness to add and if you 're ambitious you can do your own modifications.The only complaint i would have of my modified game is that there is no navy . All these wonderful maps with water but no opportunity to make destroyers or crusiers like in red alert or total annililation ... ... ... ... ... ... socks	1
This pretty good , it has a good story , great in-game movies and adequate gameplay . However most of the marketing for this game has centered around it being a sequel to Red Alert . This is simply not true . The two games have almost nothing in common and Red Alert is a far better game . In saying this I mean that Tiberian Sun takes a huge step BACKWARDS in terms of gameplay from Red Alert . Gone are the ships and air planes to be replaced by boring helicopters and cheap & quot ; hover units & quot ; .However this game is not a total waste it has a very good storyline and execellent cinematics , featuring performances by several Hollywood stars ( well maybe not stars but close enough ) . The graphics are pretty good but other games have done better.Sure it 's a classic and if you really like the series go ahead and buy it . But if you want the true best strategy game of 1999 , go and check out Homeworld it 's a far better game .	1
When I first got the game , it was & quot ; Wow & quot ; , thinking it would be the best . I have to admit , it is better than some games I have already played , but it just did n't have the zing of the other C & amp ; C games.The computer stinks . I could beat them playing as GDI ( good guys ) , which is hard because NOD ( bad guys ) has all the best vehicles , units , and structures . I love the Missile Silo . Talk about blitzcrieg on your opponent ! ! If you want to have about a 65 % chance of winning , stick with NOD.I would n't recommend the missions , because they are all too easy or all too hard . I stick to skirmish and internet games myself.I might venture to say that it is worth an inexpencive look . Maybe even borrowing it from a friend.All-in-all , I would have to say that the graphics are superb , stories are bad , sound is so-so , and gameplay is dependant on which side you choose ( NOD being better ) .	1
Final Fantasy 7 is the best FF I have yet to play . I have played 8 and 9 also , but 7 has the best music , battle system , and junctioning system of all of them ( not to mention the greatest story-line in the history of everything ! ) . Besides a couple of translation errors , this game is perfect . I was introduced to Final Fantasy 7 , 3 years ago , and I still do not know many things about it . So if your looking for a long challenge ahead of you , but not a challenge so hard that it sucks the fun out of it , you should buy this game , and before they stop selling it .	1
I have always been a FF fan ever since 2 was out . I 've been loving it ever since and was glad that i played this . Let me tell you about the game : As you have probably found out from other reviews , it is about a rebel orginization named AVALANCHE who is saving the planet from Shinra Inc. , who is polluting the Earth . One of these members is a man named Cloud , a 21 year old guy who was in a orginazation called Soldier , which is the army of Shinra . Possibly the greatest plot and climax I 've ever seen . Great battles , they proved to be a challenge . Cloud , Sid , and Red 13 are my favorite charecters . Also some of the best movies in a game that i 've seen for a long time . Espeically the 11 minute ending . Man that was good . ENJOY !	1
In this world , nothing is as it seems . No one is who they say they are , and surprises lurk around every corner . This is a wonderful game , with a rich story , great side quests , and great animation . The evil Shin-Ra corporation has been mining Mako , an energy source that is the lifeforce of the Earth itself . Avalanche is an underground resistance group headed by Barret , a man who 's arm was lost in an explosion at a Mako refinery . Cloud is a mercenary who used to work for SOLDIER , Shin-Ra 's private army . Sephiroth is a great warrior for SOLDIER , who has been lost for many years . Now , Cloud is working with Avalanche , and Sephiroth has resurfaced , but he is now an insane , powerhungry man with a desire to use Black Materia to summon a meteor to destroy the world . Materia are energy sources used in weapons to add skills to the user . This game has a great story and a great battle engine , where you can customize 9 different characters with different materia . This is a long game , but it is legendary .	1
Final Fantasy 7 is yet another gold brick in the shimmering castle of Squaresofts frequent triumphs . You will fall in love with the characters , you 'll wish you could jump right into the world . The game 's events are structured very well ( except for the ever-present `` level up before the final boss '' stage of the game ) . The graphics are wonderful in their own right . It 's just as deep and enthralling as any Final Fantasy should be.But , to be honest , it 's a hassle to bother with the PC version . It 's best to get a playstation and play it that way . FF7 's system requirements are strict and tend to make the game look and run worse than on the Playstation even if you have a good computer . And keyboard control is no fun at all ( ironically , I used a gamepad that resembles the PS controller ) . And otherwise , this is a striaght port so you 're not missing anything if you go for the PS version . But , if you refuse to/ca n't buy a playstation , this version is better than nothing and you certainly wo n't want to miss out .	1
FF 7 has always been my favorite game in the whole world , in fact , it is my whole world . I play it everyday , but I was always sad , because I had to leave the playstation to go on the internet to read about and discuss FF 7 . But not anymore ! Now , FF 7 is out on the PC , and you have to buy it at any cost , so that you can laugh and cry and live the greatest experience of all time , the experience that is Final Fantasy 7 , on your computer ! Just thinking about it is making me tear up a little . I promise , you will not be disappointed . The stunning , gut-wrenching visuals , the passionate , heart-wrenching storyline , the exciting , ball-wrenching combat system , the absolutely awe-inspiring characters ... nothing could be more perfect . You have not lived if you have not played this game .	1
This RPG is a blast to play ! The graphics and battle system will blow you away when you first play it ! There 's even a tutorial , so you can get in the game quicker ! As for the storyline , excellent ! The storyline goes all over the place , but that 's what fun about it ! The game itself is also long and entertaining . It took me 73 hours to finish , side-quests and all . You even get an amusement park filled with games and wonderful items to help you on your quest . Get this game ! ! ! It will get you hoooked on hours to come ! ! !	1
I 've never played the Playstation version of this game and this was my first time playing any sort of Final Fantasy game . I originally purchased it to watch the computer animation but quickly fell in love with the world , the characters , and the dozens of things to do.You start off playing Cloud ( or whatever you decide to name him ) and are an ex-soldier now fighting for a group called Avalanche who want to shut down a company called Shinra because they 're using Mako energy to power the city . Mako energy is the life energy of every living thing on the planet and once its used up the planet will die . From there you 're quickly plunged into a story about love , betrayal , duty , and saving the world.I easily got 40+ hours of gameplay and the story blew me away . Every time yu think you know what 's going on another clue pops up and blows everything else away . There 's an even balance between combat and actual RPG where you talk to folks in towns.This game also has great replayibility with dozens of sub-quests and side games to keep you busy . Can you raise a gold chocobo ? Can you defeat all three weapons ? Can you find all the mega-elixers ? Can you gain the secret characters ? Can you find everyone 's super technique and ultimate weapons ? The story was amazingly detailed , the characters were all unique , and the game pulled no punches . I highly reccomend it .	1
This game is fantastic , and you wont be able to put it down for a long long time . I have over 120+ hours played on my game save . Final Fantasy VII Platinum Edition features a revamped old soundtrack ... that I find 2x better than the PSone version 's soundtrack . Although it takes a while to adjust to the numpad controls , after playing for a while , you 'll wonder how you would have done it any other way . The on-screen controls are bizarre and during scenes such as the timed puzzle in the rocket ship , you 'll have a hard time typing in key combos . Materia allows you to use different magics on different characters , allowing for different characters to use Summons , Magic , and Cure . My tip : dont give up solely because of the controls -- -this game is FANTASTIC and although I found the console experience more enthralling and easier to jump into , the PC version was much more cinematic and was totally worth it . FF7 is by far the best game I have ever played , and you do not want to miss out on this adventure . My only tip : dont save over the same file , especially before you enter the Northern Crater -- you wont be able to exit it if you do.Replayability : ***** ( Tons of extra caves , quests , missions , mini-games to find , extra materia , weapons , limit-breaks , and bosses to fight well after the game is over . ) Gameplay : ***** ( Amazing boss fights , you will be on the edge of your seat during battles , incredibly fun ) Story : ***** ( The plot twists , the depth in the story , the emotions ... its AMAZING ) Graphics : ***** ( You can view on a big resolution , better textures and stuff . More crisp than the PSone version ) Controls : **** ( Takes a while to get used to , you wont want to try another control setup once you do ) Sound : ***** ( Sound effects are recycled from the PSone game , BUT , the music was totally redone , and that is one of the biggest parts of this game ) Addictiveness : ***** ( I stopped playing my other games for almost 4 months when I got into this game ) The best part of this game is that it is so easy to pick up and play . The Ruby and Emerald Weapons provide you with more challenge than the last boss of the game . Raising chocobos and minigames at the Golden Saucer couldnt be more fun , and this remains the only game besides World of Warcraft that I havent uninstalled from my computer . Final Fantasy VII is a keeper , and dont be discouraged by the prices on Amazon , by the time you 're done with the game , you will believe it to be the best $ 50 you have spent on a game . I would know , because I said the same thing .	1
this game is awesome , but see my playstation reveiw for results .	1
This Final Fantasy 7 is one of the most influenced games of all time . The fan bases for this one game blows out all FF fan base out of the water . Never has any other FF game seen such an influenced with multiple related games/story characters found in different games . Multiple Movies . Toys , cards , etc based on this game . Why was that all necessary for this one game ? It 's just that DAMN AWESOME ! This game has everything ! Story , characters , battle system , music , humor and more ! If it did n't why else did this game influenced so many other things that followed it after ? Because it was just damn awesome ! You can play this game over and over before getting tried of it , but you will keep it in your hearts forever . The amazing game play , the amazing characters , and amazing graphics . ( Back in those days . ) They just ca n't make anything that even comes close to what they did back then . I wish they did , but they ca n't ! It was just too well done ! lol	1
I 'll preface this by saying yes I have played through FFVII on the playstation when it first came out . I 've probably played through it at least a dozen times as I just enjoy the story , how it unfolds , the characters you meet and the events that transpire that intertwines their stories together.Prior to this game , I was mostly into sports/FPS type games . An RPG ( heck I did n't even know what that meant at the time ) game was not even remotely on my list of games that were coming out that I wanted . A friend of mine where I was working at showed me a gamer mag that had a full rundown of this game . Indeed it seemed very impressive and the more he talked about it , the more I got interested in it.Then came release day . I still was n't sold on it but after leaving work I figured ... what the hell . Drove 45 minutes north to the nearest mall where a buddy mine worked at EBGames . Soon as I entered he was like `` Did you preorder this ! ! '' . I told him no and that I was n't really interested in RPG 's as they always sound boring and I 'd lose interest quick and waste my money . He showed me a quick demo and I admit , it got me thinking as to `` I wonder what happens after this ... '' . I finally said sure . He hooked me up with the strategy guide , free tshirt and the 3 disc game ... 3 DISCS ! ! When I cracked open the case and saw 3 discs ... I knew this would be an epic , legendary tale . I just did n't know how epic.I wo n't go much into the characters as they have been around a long time and most know who/what they are . But the story ... wow . I could not have been more hooked . At first it started off a little slow , mostly to get you introduced to the characters and get some backstory going . After the 2nd mako reactor explosion and you get knocked into slums and fall through the church and meet Aeris ... it all changes . The direction , tone and emotion starts running higher . Battles get more intense . You really get the feel that something big , much bigger than even all these characters is building up . It all seems to point to Shinra , but even as you infiltrate it , something is even more disturbing . JENOVA . Soon as I saw that short cutscene with Cloud peeking inside its stasis chamber.. my jaw dropped . I wanted to know what it is , where it came from , what they are using it for etc etc etc . But thats what set this game apart . The more answers you get , the more questions were raised than before.The world is huge , lots of explorable areas with side quests and storylines . I spent alot of time raising the Chocobos and racing them to get the Gold Choco so I can access the caves that contained important and powerful items and materia.Materia System : One of the best magic systems I have encountered to date . While you wo n't use all the materia you buy/find . Its the reward of seeing that glowing green/blue/red/yellow/purple stone that makes you fight to get it and see what it is . Summons are excellent with great animation for the time it was made . Knights of the Round was very long to summon , but the damage and wait is well worth it.Characters : Some of the most diverse ever seen and very deep with different backgrounds . I think the first time I really got a sense of how immense this story was getting was when I first went into Shinra Mansion with all the creepy creatures you fight and head into the basement where all the Shinra research was stored regarding JENOVA , Sephiroth and the experiments . The characters sucked you in with their drive and emotion to the situations . Making you want to keep going and see whats around the next corner.In conclusion , for us long-timers here this game never gets old . For the newcomers , get ready to experience something extraordinary . To quote the back of the Playstation case.. `` What erupts goes beyond imagintion '' .	1
An interesting aspect of the Final Fantasy series was that all of the games were essentially an experiment . The first game was the ultimate experiment : will this game succeed or will Square go under ? But each game was a stage in development.FF- Choosing party , and character sprites in battle ( Before that , the Dragon Warrior games had battle head-on ) FFII- wound-developable characters ( Romancing SaGa later employed this , when you survive near death your hp goes up , when you fight alot attack goes up , etc . ) FF3J- simple job system ( completely changes characters , no permanent skills ) FF4- Changing characters ( a dark knight becomes a paladin ) FFV- Advanced job system ( level up with one of the non-command skills to default class , and you permanently learn it , for instance the run skill you can learn from the thief , and then de-equip it ) FFVI- basic GF system ( mainly just boosts skills ) FF7- basic weapon systemFF8- GF systemFF9- I heard it had some sort of advanced weapon system where different weapons learn different magic , never bought the gameLikewise , the plot in each was experimental . They fiddled around with the crystal concept in FF1 , FF3J , FF4 , FFV . They had ruthless kings , dark overlords , and the occasional malicious squid . But the most intense game I have played so far was Final Fantasy 7 . Why ? Well , when halfway through the game your character does n't even know who he is anymore , it is pretty interesting . Not to mention you have combos to build , chocobos to raise and race ( never was good at this ) , and some pretty weird items to collect ( I mean honestly , what other game has you give some girl digestant in exchange for perfume and a dress for your male character to wear ) .	1
Words really can describe how wonderful this game is . The first thing you will notice is the incredible graphics ( note : a 3D card is not required ! . ) Everything is drawn in great detail right down to character traits and facial expressions ( who would have thought a fleshless person would be so good with expressions . ) The story is also very entertaining and added with the graphics , it makes this a very absorbing adventure . This is one of the few games that I ca n't say anything negative about . This is a must have !	1
Grim Fandango will definitally be enjoyed by fans of film noir and mexican mythology . I 'd give it a 4 and a half if i could . The graphics have their flaws and the game runs choppy on systems not far ahead of the system requirements . Some of the puzzles are utterly impossible to figure out without incredible luck or the aid of a stradegy guide but the game is truly astonishing . You follow the character Manny Calavera , a travel agent for the dead , guiding souls to their final resting place in the best way possible . For some reason , Manny is denied any premium clients . Whos behind all this ? Find out over a 4 year journey from the dusty streets of El Marrow , to the edge of the world and back again . Absolutely beautiful backgrounds and film noir-ish music immerse you in the atmosphere . Clever interface and variable controls are great . A very involving game . Not too long not too short . Humor and wit are weaved through every scene . In conclusion , film noir style , surreal visuals , toe tapping and ensuing music , gripping story , charming characters , and challenging puzzles will intrigue all game fans .	1
I had problems with it at first - crashing but then i installed the patch that i downloaded and it worked great . The game did remind me a lot of the Monkey Island series . Although monkey Island i 'd say had the best music . Grim had ok music . Game was funny and at the end i wanted more- i finished it too fast ( i should n't have used those cheats ) . Really recommended , I wish there was a part II .	1
This was truly one of the best games I have played in a long time . It has challenging puzzles that may at times seem impossible but the solution is often right before your eyes . Based upon the Mexican Day of the Dead it gives the player a little bit of background while keeping them entertained . Great game , lots of P.I . cliches , mentally stimulating , and just plain FUN !	1
Not a whole lot to say except that as far as adventure games go , this is the standard that all others should try to exceed.Outstanding voice acting and scripting . Hilarious game without making fun of itself . Tough but logical puzzles that will have you scratching your head . Beautiful and ORIGINAL storyline , movie material right here.This is what adventure gaming was fated for .	1
I was very dubious when I started playing Grim Fandango . An adventure game with polygons ? And the SCUMM menu interface system that was in every single past Lucasarts adventure game was gone ? But I gave it a try . Thank goodness I did.Grim Fandango is a story about Manny Calavera , a travel agent for the souls of the dead . He sells packages to the departed for their four year journey to their just rewards , and if he sells enough he can earn enough to make his own trip someday.Imagine the theme of Casablanca with some mexican folklore and Mayan art thrown in for fun . Add big orange demons , hot rods , killer beavers , cat races , and the grim reaper and you have Grim Fandango.The story is supurb and the voice acting was top notch . It 's very difficult to do a dramatic yet humorous story , but somehow this game pulls it off . Grim Fandango could yank me to the brink of tears one moment and cause me to almost bust a gut another.The things that make a good adventure game are all there . Logical puzzles that do n't cause your gameplay to come to a standstill until you solve them , good acting , good animation , and good code ! If I were ever forced to reccomend only on adventure game to someone , this would be it .	1
This is without a doubt one of the best games ever made - adventure or otherwise . It is fun , amusing , original , colorful , and challenging without being annoying . The only games that came close to it may be the Monkey Island series or The Last Express . The game is beautifully designed , with unforgettable characters , amazing landscapes , and reminds me of being inside a really well-written movie . Sadly , LucasArts stopped making games like this , a loss for the world .	1
If they made more games like this , I 'd be a pauper . Intelligent , funny , easy to use , easy to solve , and no bloody chess problems . It 's also thought-provoking , gorgeous , well-written , and as believable as talking skeletons and elevator demons can make it . One of my favorites that I play over and over again . One caveat : At least one puzzle seems to be tied to processor speed , so if you have a fast machine you 'll need to download a patch from the manufacturers ' website . Well worth the trouble , though .	1
This is the EPITOME of graphic adventures . No other game has even come close to GRIM FANTANGO when it comes to humor ( of all shades and shapes ) , inventiveness , delicious irony , creative graphics and plain good-ol ' FUN ! ! This is a 10-year old game mind you - yet , it retains its freshness as any true work of art . THIS IS HOW COMPUTER GAMES SHOULD HAVE BEEN - and not the pathetic cookie-cutter products of mega-corporations working in-tandem with GX-card companies ... Your character ( hilarious and lovable Manny Calavera ) is already ... dead when you start . In fact he has been dead for some time , stuck in limbo , trying to pay his way to a better afterlife by selling tickets to other souls on their way to paradise . Guess what : corruption is not limited just to this world . And where there is corruption , there is oppression ; and where there is oppression , there is always a revolution brewing ... Realizing he is being duped , Manny reluctantly joins the afterlife underground and takes us in a tour de force of one of the MOST BEAUTIFUL GAME EVER PRODUCED . Immersing noirish atmosphere , detailed art-deco settings , fast Bogartian dialogs - with a subtle ironic frosting.WARNING : There are known problems with today 's faster processors . So , unless you have a really old system running Win98 you will need the WinXP PATCH ( otherwise you will not get past the crane scene ) .WITH THE HIGHEST RECOMMENDATIONS ! ! !	1
I still remember when I first bought this game in the 90 's and I still playthe game from time to time for both entertainment and nostalgia . As with most of the pc games in the 90 's there was no type commands but just the point and click with the mouse usually but still the humor and video cut scenes in the game were more than enough to keep you playing until the end . The short story-plot was your character was a civil servant for the spiritual plane where the recently departed had to stop before making their final passage to eternal rest . Your character for whatever reason had to work off a certain amount of time to clear his debt before going to the place of eternal rest as well . The job was you worked to see how well the person who just died was in life meaning the more compassionate , and humane they were in life the faster to paradise they would get to meaning the usual ways to get to paradise depending on the person was bus , boat , car , and if very high on the morality meter the number nine train which would only take nine minutes for the person to get to paradise . Of course there was more to the game and that is why it made it very entertaining to play . The video graphics are of the 90 's era so again if your used to playing recent pc games you might feel the graphics are sub par but do n't let that dissuade you from this game . The voice actors they got to do the characters were incredible both in their acting for their characters and their ability to bring the humor and excitement into the game itself . I know while some think this does n't have the fighting or the action of recent pc games but I still feel that it 's one of the few classics that many people will still find very enjoyable to play both for themselves and children without worrying about to much violence of the game .	1
Grim Fandango is best described as a detective story in the Film Noir tradition . The hero of the piece , Manny Calavera , evokes the private eye of the 1940 's or '50 's melodrama whose story begins with a dame walking into his office and who quickly finds himself enmeshed in a vast and corrupt conspiracy which may do him in . The difference here is that at the beginning of this story , Manny is already dead , and the events transpire in the Land of the Dead , the place where , according to Mexican folklore , departed souls go to embark on their journey to the hereafter.Blending Mexican folk mythology with the Film Noir genre , Grim Fandango is ultimately respectful of both traditions , and the striking art design is in keeping with this approach , combining Art Deco and pre-Columbian elements . The dialogue , refreshingly witty and literate , draws the player in to the characters and the story , as does the varied musical score , which includes Mexican folk melodies.The characters are for the most part vividly drawn , and due to the superb performances by the voice talent ( particularly Tony Plana as Manny and Maria Canals as Meche ) are fresh despite their mostly formula roles . One character which may provoke mixed reactions is that of Glottis , Manny 's driver . A cartoonish , Jar Jar Binks-like figure , Glottis skews the story in a younger direction ( at odds with the mild epithets employed by other characters in a few instances ) , and while my children liked Glottis , I expect most players will find him either endearing or irritating.The interface in this game is unusual . Rather than pointing and clicking with a mouse , the player controls Manny 's movements with the arrow keys , waiting to see Manny 's head turn to an object he becomes interested in and clicking & quot ; enter & quot ; to see what happens . This approach takes some getting used to , and can be cumbersome at times , but it places Manny at the center of the action and increases the player 's identification with Manny , ultimately serving the story.The puzzles , many of which are multi-step , involve crafting Rube Goldberg solutions to various problems . Some of the solutions are thoroughly counterintuitive ( I wo n't give anything away , but let 's just say that objects such as balloons or a crystal paperweight are employed in bizarre ways ) , and are best solved through aggressive trial and error . Clues may pop up from time to time to expedite this sometimes tedious process . That aside , the Lucasarts team , especially writer Tim Schafer , deserve high praise for this highly original and literate adventure .	1
If you liked Full Trottle and love LucasArts ' games in general , you 'll love this game . It 's one of the funniest games I 've ever played . The way all the charters talk hispanic is enough to me laugh out loud . Manny Calavera is the most likeable anit-hero you 'll ever have the pleasure to control , in this fantastic Land of The Dead adventure game . Who said the adventure games was dead . Grim Fandango proofs them all wrong ...	1
I do n't go for adventure games , personally . Ninety percent of the time , I prefer shooters . But this one ... man , it 's so weird , so unique , and so GENIUS through and through , how can you not love it ? Here 's the story . Manny Calavera is a low-level salesman trying to earn an honest commission and make a decent day 's pay , but it never seems to work out for him . His boss is constantly on his back , he 's routinely snaked by a competitor , Domino Hurley , and the right sales never come his way . It 's a lousy life to have.Especially if you 're already dead.That 's the twist ; Manny , and just about everyone else in the game , is dead . This whole game takes place in the Land of the Dead of Mexican/Aztec folklore , with a strong Art Deco influence , with heavy doses of '30s crime noir thrown in . Everyone in the game is fashioned to look like the sugar skeletons used in Day of the Dead festivals ( called 'calaveras ' ; get it ? ) .Manny works in the Department of Death , trying to work off his time for his misdeeds when he was alive . He does that by trying to sell 'travel packages ' to the recently deceased , so they can make their four-year journey across the Land of the Dead , until they reach the portal leading to the Land of Eternal Rest . The quality of life this person lived determines whether they get to use a car , a luxury liner , or the exclusive No . 9 train , which speeds its passengers there in four minutes , instead of the customary four years.Unfortunately , the kind of lowlifes who keep coming Manny 's way only deserve walking sticks at best , which does absolutely nothing to help Manny work off his time . So , he decides to take matters into his own hands and STEAL the right kind of client.And that 's when he gets in over his head.The story is pure crime noir with a technicolor twist , like Raymond Chandler meets Tim Burton . The plot Manny uncovers is convoluted , brilliant , deeply twisted , and diabolical like you 've never imagined possible . It 's also incredibly , unspeakably funny . Tim Schaefer is one absurd individual , make no mistake.Yes , it 's an old game , I know . But the true classics know no age , and this is a classic all right . So take advantage of the price , snap it up , and book a trip with your new favorite travel agent . He 's waiting for you ...	1
Grim Fandango combines every element you look for in an adventure game in a fluent and involving fashion . The plot , the comedy , the political intrigues , an occasional romance ... All right here ! One of the things I found most amusing was , whenever Manny ( the main character ) manages to build his life ( or is it death ? ) up again , you ( the player ) takes over and manages to ruin it in a day ! ( Whew , think I got enough parenthesis in ! ) If you enjoy an easy-going adventure game with a great story to tell , this game 's for you !	1
Possibly the most original game idea in the history of adventure games , _Grim Fandango_ has a charm which is all in the execution . This is as close to being in a movie as the adventure game genre has yet allowed . Blending the tradition of Mexican folklore with the suave of sixties ' beat culture and the style of _The Big Combo_ , _Fandango_ is a sensory explosion . Somewhat courageously , it does *not* attempt to make its graphics realistic . Rather , it searches successfully to use its medium to best effect . Like the best films , _Fandango_ manipulates its elements to produce a world unto itself . Its first-rate direction and hitherto unique-to-adventure-games 3D technology points the way forward for the adventure games.True , some of the puzzles are hard , but none of them really seem out of place . Indeed , there is with _Grim Fandango_ a true sense of plot . Maybe the characters do n't develop as they do in novels or great films , but , thanks to fine vocal talent and crisp writing , they do maintain charming integrity throughout.If I have a complaint with the game , it is the interface by which your character , Manny , communicates with others . You choose from among several sentence options , like those old & quot ; choose-an-ending & quot ; books . It 's not a *bad* way to play a game , I suppose , but just as multiple choice tests are always easier than writing essays , being able to choose from amongst a few limited options make it easier to get information out of the rest of the game 's cast . As a result , solving problems is sometimes dead simple . Of course , there are n't many better options for game developers trying to give players a sense of control of their destinies , but it makes one long for the day when the promise of a game like _Titanic_ , with its limited ability to understand unique phrases typed in by the player , might be more fully realized.Some people , though , might like the fact that they exhaust their investigations of other characters pretty quickly . It does speed game play , and is n't as frustrating as trying to find the right questions on your own might be . This *is* a big game , with lots of scenes and lots of people to meet . Speed-of-play matters . So , even if I personally believe there must be a better way to communicate to other characters , I can hardly rate the game down for what is possibly the best solution currently available.Thus , even if you think you do n't like adventure games , you should still buy _Grim Fandango_ . Likewise , if you do n't have time to play adventure games , you should get a walkthrough and cheat your way to the end , because the graphics , story , and soundtrack are just that good . This is one of the seminal achievements in the genre , and to miss out on it would be to accept a huge gap in your understanding of where the games industry might be heading .	1
This game is definitely a hundred steps past Quake and others of its type . The AI is great . The evolving story is great . The fight against the Special Forces team is nerve wrackingly great . However , all this greatness became stale , I never bothered to finish the game . The game just seemed to grow old after a time . Maybe it needs something more to carry the player through ?	1
Even though this game is almost 15 years old and uses a modified Quake engine , it is still one of the most FUN and best shooters ever to be made . In fact all other first person shooters and games in general can learn from Half Life 1 . The game world is extremely immersive . There are no level ends , there is no text to read , there are no scores and everyone talks to you without freezing you into a cut scene . All of this makes you feel less like you are a player playing a game , but you are indeed the hero Gordon Freeman . Characters recognize you , talk to you , and you can have them come with you or stay put . Security guards that come with you will shoot enemies ( slowly ) .The story is that you are silent protagonist Gordon Freeman ( you 'll feel like him by the end ) and you work for Black Mesa , your standard super secret facility . Something goes horribly wrong and uh . The formula is very simple , but they execute it so well that other games have copied it and failed ( Doom 3 ) . Needless to say you need to fight your way out through the facility , on the desert ( being chased by a helicopter ) , and everything else would just be a spoiler . There are no levels , no loading screens . Loading is seamless and happens during downtime.Half Life 1 has simple controls and an optional tutorial level . There are buttons for jumping , crouching ( sneaking ) , using your flashlight ( that needs to be off to charge it ) , shooting , secondary shooting ( for machine guns ) and `` using '' things . The game is always in run mode and character speed seems to be fast . Too fast sometimes , but there is that sneak button that will slow you down.But how is the first person shooting ? There is a wide variety of guns and each has a certain joy and usefulness to them . Even the simple pistol is useful for lesser enemies 8 hours into the game . There is a shotgun , a machine gun with grenade launcher , grenades , explosives you detonate , wall sensors with explosives , a harpoon , a laser guided rocket launcher that once it launches you point your cursor and it will turn accordingly , lasers , homing missiles , head crabs and more . An amazing array that you continue to get even up to the final levels areas . To swap weapons you push 6 number keys and press some keys twice to access some weapons like the shotgun / machine gun / harpoon.You start with a crowbar good for breaking grates , and destroying boxes . Destroying boxes is how you will find most items and ammo . Instead of just finding things scattered on the floor , on shelves or on a desk you need to bash open boxes to find the good stuff . You can also push or pull the boxes too which is nice for puzzle solving and platforming.The enemies are just as diverse and each one requires you to think and act differently . Since I do n't know the name of any enemy I 'll fumble through this . The start enemies are lesser creatures that will start on the floor and jump at you . 2 shots from a pistol take them out . There are zombie-ish aliens that take a shotgun or two , but they are easy enough to avoid . Aliens that teleport in and beam electricity at you will cause you to hide , pudgy little alien crawler / hoppers will make you shoot from a distance because they will send out a small shockwave . Standard soldiers that will shoot machine guns , throw grenades and coordinate attacks against you like flanking . Ceiling huggers that are yucky red globs on the ceiling with long rope like tongues that when they catch you , you 'll be pulled up and eaten ... if you do n't shoot them . Giant aliens with homing missiles too . There is a wide variety of enemies and bosses . I ca n't list them all.The game also shines with its tricks and traps and will throw a puzzle or challenge at you to keep you thinking . But in this game it does n't feel like a puzzle or a challenge . It seems natural . There can be a hidden turret where the fun is making your choice how to take it out ... Grenade , explosive , shooting it and getting shot in the process , running by it or just not hitting the trip wire to start it in general . Wall sensor explosives , push and pull box puzzles , pushing buttons , hopping hanging boxes over a pit , conveyer belts , using a sky cannon to destroy walls , using turrets , on rails vehicles that you have a lot of control over , water puzzles , high jump pads and so on . There is a lot of variety and it 's never the same thing twice.To sum it up , this is a diverse and VERY FUN game . It has a sense of humor to it and you 'll feel like you are Gordon Freeman through the game 's well crafted immersion . Puzzles , shooting and challenges all melded together into one fantastic game and I ca n't say that too often .	1
I was never a big fan of the first-person shooter ( FPS ) genre , but after giving Half-Life a try ( thanks to all of the glimmering reviews ) , I am absolutely hooked . From the opening tram sequence , you 're mesmerized by Gordon Freeman 's plight and the falling Black Mesa world surrounding him . It 's a game that keeps you in a trance from midnight to the first crack of sunlight ( apologies to my wife ! ) . After dishing out punishment to those Marines , be sure to frag some people in the outstanding multiplayer modes . The fun gets even better , and the taste of death is even sweeter when you blow apart that guy with 196 kills . Half-Life is truly a work of art . Opposing Forces , here I come .	1
I bought the original when it first came out in 1998 . In late 2004 Valve rereleased Half-Life with the update source engine used in Half-life 2 . There is no new content though . I decided to play source to coincide with the 10th anniversary of this amazing game . Source just has more realistic water , a better physics engine , ragdolls , some better lighting effects , cleaner mapping and new 3D skybox . I am happy I have played source but the differences between this and the original may not be enough to justify the costs . The differences are not really noticeable . So if you want to play Half-Life just know that there are two versions of the game out there . Half-Life standard and Half-Life : Source.Now , to the story so far ... In the Beginning ... There was nothing new much in the Half-Life game engine which was essentially just a modern hack of the Quake game engine , so how could a game that based itself on software that others developed succeed in becoming the biggest selling game of all time ? When Half-Life first came out it did a couple of things right that most other first person shooters failed to do ... ( 1 ) Story , ( 2 ) Story and ( 3 ) Story . Valve created Half-Life in a period of our lives when Area 51 was a hot topic among UFO buffs and the X-Files was to become mainstream family television viewing . Alien based entertainment media was a craze in the mid and late 1990 's , unprecedented since the 1950s . Smack in the middle of what could be considered the most influential era for UFO enthusiasts came HALF-LIFE where YOU get to play as Gordon Freeman , a physics researcher who witnesses a freak accident in an Area 51 type facility . All hell breaks loose and YOU have to survive . No cut scenes . No initial story . No explanation . You where just there and you had to escape . Cue interactive characters that could follow you around and say a few things , maps rich in objects that you could break eventually leading up to rapid action shootouts with monsters and marines.Playing HL again was simply reliving that experience all over . Yes games have improved but this offering still destroys a lot of the competition . Valve just did it right and there is no reason not to want to load this up and give it a whirl again . Let 's face it , this is gaming history . Half-life changed the FPS scene in ways other games have since tried but failed . Has there ever been a revolution in FPS quite like Half-life ? Some may have come close but not nearly as far . That is how important this game is .	1
The Good : Game holds up 10 years later , one of the best told stories in gaming history , a lot of memorable moments , tons of mods availableThe Bad : Graphics look hideous these days , newer gamers will hate this due to all the flaws that stick out , to many `` mazy '' levelsMan O ' man does this bring back a lot of good memories . I remember almost dying because my mom 's computer could n't run HL1 . I begged her to get the computer upgraded ( at the time not even knowing how this was possible or the cost ) she just would n't do it . All I could do was stare at videos and screenshots until I thought would be forever *da-da-da ! * until I heard about the PS2 port ! I was so excited I babysat my bratty sisters for a whole summer and laid down $ 200 smackeroonies on a used PS2 , but to my luck HL was no where to be seen . It turns out not many copies of the game were made so they were scarce . Settling with a rental I finally was able to play the game , but it was starting to feel old because I did n't get ahold of it until late 2003 . Realizing that I was missing out on a lot AT THE TIME I wound up losing my save and being so angry never touched the game again . Four years later I can finally play the game again thanks to Steam ( I actually ordered the HL1 Anthology off of EBgames for $ 20 ) and I DEFINITELY realized what I missed now that I have finally been able to finish the game.Half-Life used the Quake II engine at the time which was fighting against the Unreal engine technically . While Half-Life never looked as good as Unreal Valve pulled some strings and did some custom stuff with the physics , water , and lighting effects that was n't originally in the Q2 engine . HL is n't just your regular run & gun shooter the story is told all in real time by running into certain characters and by just progressing you get an idea of what 's going on without much dialog . This was revolutionary at the time and so were the weapons , graphics , sound , physics , and enemies . The game has your usual weapons like machine guns with grenade launchers , pistols , revolvers etc . but HL has some weapons up it 's sleeve that were never seen before . Those such weapons happen to be a laser guided rocket launcher ( you guide it with your mouse ! ) I remember people buzzing about this weapons back in the day and it 's still pretty cool . You also have the Bee Gun which is a weird slimy thing that shoots killer bees , you have some strange electricity guns , mines , laser mines , satchel charges etc.The enemies were also something never seen before like the Head Crabs , Head Crab Zombies , the Ichthyosaur , the Vortigaunts etc . The game also had HUGE bosses which was amazing back in the day and seemed very epic . The game was dark , creepy , and very hard as well . Most shooters back in the late 90 's were just run & gun nonsense in dark tunnels , military complexes etc . Half-Life is not innocent and does do this , but there are other places to see like climbing a HUGE canyon and looking out over the *ugly* vista that looks like the Grand Canyon . Today it looks like someone slapped a low-res JPEG image in the background , but in the late 90 's things like this seemed like you were staring over a GrindLift in Gears of War 2 . Half-Life was just so real and so amazing back in it 's day that it really kind of shocks you how such an old game can still make that kind of impact.The game also consists of a lot of maze like halls that you can get easily lost in and I found this the main problem with HL . Some of the puzzles were a bit confusing to do and navigating the endless halls calls for a much needed walkthrough . While the level design is excellent and you pretty much know where to go there are those occasional moments that make you wander around the whole area a few times and look in every nook and cranny wondering what switch you missed or what do you need to go through . Some neat things back in the day was being able to have the Blue Shift men help you and ask scientists to open doors for you . While this is standard these days this kind of AI was unknown to the late 90 's PC gamers . This added to the realism and made you fee like you really are stuck in Black Mesa trying to fight off the alien invasion.You 're probably wondering what the story is right ? Well it 's simple really , Gordan Freeman ( that 's you ) arrives in Anomalous Hazards as a regular employee and an experiment goes awry and Gordan must escape the facility and figure out the source of the alien invasion . The story , as I 've already said , is n't told through cut scenes , but rather in real time while you play . This helps add to the experience , but of course may bore most younger PC gamers who are used to FEAR , Crysis , CoD etc . Half-Life is for the hardcore old school PC shooter fans only and really takes cunning skill to finish . The game will give you less and less health as you go and you 'll have to figure out how to take out a room of 10 bad guys with only 2 health . While this is n't impossible it can be done and requires precise skill ( thus only for hardcore fans ) .Most of you have probably played HL2 already and these games are pretty much completely different besides the content . You still have your hazard suit , most of the weapons are the same , but there is more stuff in HL1 . About 40 % of the weapons and enemies in HL1 are n't in HL2 . HL2 is more realistic while HL1 is more of a sci-fi type game . Thankfully you can play HL2 without even touching HL1 ( which I did ) , but HL1 explains a lot of things that are n't explained in HL2 and there are bits in HL2 that are for fans of HL1 that you normally would n't know about unless you played this game.Now of course HL1 has a lot of flaws like floaty physics , being able to run 100mph , cheap deaths , poor graphics but these are flaws seen from age . If you were to warp back to 1998 the game was almost flawless . Now when it comes to upgrades and mods there is an endless ocean . There are a ton of amazing multiplayer and singe player mods available and I have spend hours and hours on most of them . You must go to FilePlanet.com and download these mods because they are super fun . HL1 also has a free hi-def pack that you can download to update the graphics a little bit . If you want to go even further pick up Half-Life : Source which uses HL2 's engine to make things look more modern . I highly recommend the Source version for people who just ca n't stand `` old graphics '' , but old school shooter fan should just get the hi-def pack just for nostalgia 's sake .	1
Half Life Revolutionized PC gaming . It is one of the greatest IF not The best pc game ever made . It has bin said that from almost every Pc Mag or Game mag . I was a few to own this masterpiece when it first hit stores and all I can say is ... wowThis game really changed about the FPS gaming . It just made me think different about FPS . It truly is a masterpiece . I wo n't spoil this games amazing story of the g man 's adventure . I wont even say how good this game is you just have to play it for your self.The graphics for that time was amazing and so will the upcoming HALF LIFE 2 BABY ! nuff saidThe gameplay ... ... .You 're a moron if You acctually think I 'm gon na go into that since we already no how incredible the game is ... .Nuff ' saidThe story is what makes this game ... a game..it 's not just any shooter ... it 's history in the making..well for games atleast ... I 'm just gon na make this short and sweet for you ... THIS GAME IS AMAZING ! Of course this deserves a5 out of 5 stars ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Amazing ... Just amazing ... Nuff said get the game before HL2 comes out..Lates..	1
Fans of dedicated single-player `` first person shooter '' games who 've never played this game before should definitely not pass it up . HL takes an utterly unoriginal idea for either games or movies and crafts an utterly unstoppable gaming experience . You play Gordon Freeman , who works in the bowels of an ultra-secret , underground research facility called `` The Black Mesa '' . ( Having played the game yet I 'm still not sure what 's supposed to be going on in BM - it 's what happens that matters . ) Oozing high-tech , the facility is host to another dimension when you/Freeman accidentally ... do something that tears a whole in the fabric of our own - allowing beings from that other world to enter ours.Now , if you think that these otherworldly denizens are peaceful beings intent on fostering cross-dimensional love , or that your fellow human beings will enter the Black Mesa unarmed intent on warmly welcoming these beings to our world , I 'm afraid you 've picked up the wrong game entirely . For in the bowels of `` Black Mesa '' you 'll confront howling dog things , flying crabs , alien-zombified versions of your colleagues , gigantic aliens that breathe fire through their fists , aliens that hang from ceilings ( and entrap their victims using these vine-looking things ) and squads of human special forces troops intent on killing everything that moves . If the above attracts you because you think it may be the setting that elevates the nobility of the human existence , I should warn you to look elsewhere - for in `` Half Life '' , you 'll find yourself acting indiscriminately with a 9mm automatic , a submachine gun , grenades and ( most regrettably of all ) a nasty crowbar ; you 'll make few friends and find yourself ( for the most part ) alone and ( not infrequently ) exiled to ventilation ducts ( again with the ducts ! ! ) to avoid getting shot at by humans , or burned , bitten , bolted or tongue-bathed by aliens . Complex problem solving skills ( as much as marksmanship or bullet-saving ) are crucial in this game - in which your enemies have above-average levels of AI . There are unfortunately times when a level may be hung up by the failure to achieve some specific mission-goal , but this is on the whole a game in which the goals are sufficiently complex to make you feel cool for achieving them , yet not so complex as to be impossible to solve . The settings are fantastic - from the vast to claustrophobic . The game is long - uncommitted gamers may find it tedious - but the scope of design here rewards those who keep up with it.I ran this game on an XP-equipped P4 , with a 64MB AGP card , and had no problems ( other than those involving the evil aliens and homicidal fellow humans ) . Graphics and sound were smooth , and I suffered no CTD 's .	1
Made in 98 , but still better quality , play , and design than most games on the market in '05 . Good storyline , great AI and graphics , not-overly aggressive system requirments , tons of add-ons available . Incredible single player mode , good weapon selection , and arguably one of the best FPS online games of all time . If you like HALO , you will like Halflife . Very similar , but no limit on how many weapons you can carry , and the levels are n't as repetative . ( My biggest complaint about Halo , though it 's obvious why , many of the levels and hallways are exact copies of one you 've seen dozens of times already ... gives a feeling of being lost , and even fed up at times . ) Halo does have the edge as far as cars and what not though . I also recommend Halflife 2 , the sequel to what I 'm talkin about here ... INSANE graphics and gameplay .	1
posibly the best game i ever played ! this game is great , u may think u should just rent it , but dont.This game is so long it took me bout 2 months to pass it.there is a great storyline.i played all of HL games and this is the best one.for example in half life 1 u get to a radio , and a soldier says there to retreat . if u play opposing forse ull see this guy saying same thing to abort and same voice.great story line , great wepons , great multiplayer.trust me ull never get tired of this game.GET THE GAME ! ! ! P.S . : you wont regret this .	1
I usually turned off all lights and played game in deep night after a whole-day work , even on bloody Quake I or Doom II , it is ok. And I was for a long time a Quake II fan , esp . in single player mode . With numerous add-on levels distributed on the web , I thought the 3D-shooter game has reached the limit in Quake II . But alas , what a game the Half-Life is ! I DARE NOT played it in the deep night alone with all lights off . With a very good storyline and excellent atmosphere , the game is horrible ! You never know what the next step will be . The monsters are not stupidly standing there waiting for your bullets , instead they are chasing and hunting you . It is simply the best single player 3d shoot game so far .	1
Alright already . It 's a great game . Good AI , graphics . Runs well . Atmospheric . Great story and dialogue . Comedy . Blah , blah , blah.Wait a minute . I got a complaint ! That movie in the beginning . You ca n't escape it . It just goes on and on babbling while you 're stuck in a stupid tram car . Sheesh . What a bore . That kind of nonsense will cost you a star . Later , I went thru that ride a few times because I grew to like the eerie understated music . Still , I think I should have been able to skip the intro movie . Ruined the whole game for me .	1
Great game . Old now of course , but still fun to play . Good gameplay and pretty good graphics , not the best but good . Fun shooter . The Half-Life series is really successful and this is the game that started it . You dont have to have a great computer to play this game and thats the plus of it . I never beat this game , but got close to it , I just got stuck lol . If you are new to the Half-Life series , then this is the game to get . Check it out !	1
i did n't like this game when i first saw it at E3 , but when i went back and played it , it turned out to be pretty good . Not too many boss monsters ( i hate those things ) , some of the monsters are rather agile , the weapons are new , the graphics are extremely pretty ( nice colors , great water ) , you can configure all sorts of things , there are some good guys to help you out ( they show you hidden goodies ) and the game makes a lot of effort to be stable . Hey , they even have a story and little logs you can read to get a feel for the story.It 's not as story-scripted as Half-Life ( but then , it does n't have the awful Xen world either ) , and many people prefer the realistic weapons of Quake to the unusual ones of Unreal . i like the built-in bots in multiplayer ( i think this was the first game to ship with them ) , but i 'm told the net play is really slow	1
I was feeling nostalgic last week so I started playing Unreal again . Probably for my third time through at this point ! While Unreal does n't have as much replay value as a game like Half Life it certainly does have its moments ! Unreal was one of those really impressive FPS games for it 's time . It boasted great graphics and intense game play . Of course by 2008 's standards these graphics merely look silly ! But if you were picking this up in '98 like I was , you were pretty impressed.I figure I 'll throw in some points about playing this on a more current system , since I experienced some issues here and there . Being a game made for Windows 98 it does n't translate perfectly over to an XP 32 bit system . I have no idea what this would do on Vista 's 64 bit architecture . Basically when re-installing it I got a strange error with the option to `` ignore '' . You can definitely get away with doing that and then it will install fine . Strangely every time you reinsert the disc to play some more you have to cancel out of the install process and that `` ignore '' message comes up as well . I 'm not sure if this is just my system , but I recommend saving quite frequently , at least every time you hit a `` load '' screen . For some reason the game will randomly crash after a little while and it exits out completely for you . This can be frustrating if you 've been playing for a while , because it does n't auto save between load screens . Otherwise it played very smoothly on the newer system . You can also get the Unreal Anthology which has been updated to handle Windows XP . Oh and this was on a Pentium 4 , 3.0 ghz system.That being said , I 'll move onto the actual review for anyone thinking about delving into this great game for their first time . The first thing you notice is that you have almost no health . You begin to discover why as you start wandering around a crashed space ship and it appears you were some kind of prisoner . Naturally the first things you need to do are finding some health and then find some way out of the ship . The ship is kind of a boring part of the level , but it leads you a bit into the story line because you clearly crash landed on an alien planet . When you finally get out of the ship the first thing you 'll notice is how amazing and stunning the world is that has been created for you . Outside it 's very bright and vibrant in spots . This felt a little different compared to games like Quake , Half Life , Doom , because a lot of those games are very dark and have a major dungeon crawl atmosphere to them . Unreal has a lot of that usual stuff as well , but it also has a lot of time spent outside where you get to see amazing scenery . One thing the developers did right was making you feel like the in game world was huge ! This was really impressive and fun when you first got into it.As you explore and interact with the world you learn more about what 's going on with this planet called Na Pali . Apparently the native people are called the Nali and they 've been enslaved by an alien race called the Skaarj . The Nali are extreme pacifists and I ca n't help but think their designers wanted them to be Buddhists for the most part . The Skaarj on the other hand are the main enemy of the game , though not the only enemy creatures you 'll face . They are a warrior race that pretty much takes over wherever it sees fit . You 'll notice that the Skaarj design is clearly influenced by Predator . They have a humanoid lizard design and have a mouth design that looks just like that of a Predator . To brandish even MORE similarities they also have energy weapons and steel double claws attached to their arms . As you can see this is n't very original . Another part that is kind of unoriginal/strange is the Nali castles that you come across . They are clearly living in what we would term a medieval level society versus the Skaarj who have high grade technology . Strangely you come across large castles that look like they 're straight out of thirteenth century England . I know ... strange for a race of pacifists . Despite all this , those parts are some of the most fun to play through . I loved going into the castles and running around ! Another aspect that made Unreal very special , when compared to other FPS games , was the sheer amount of atmosphere that is injected into this game . It truly does feel like you 're on an alien world . The sounds , the textures , were all there perfectly bringing you into this world , almost so much that you did n't want to leave ! You even hear echoes off of cliffs if you 're walking through a cavern , it 's like they tried to get as many little details in order to immerse the user . For it 's time the Unreal graphics engine was also very impressive and really took things up a notch in the gaming world . They also programmed enemies to react more realistically to the user when confronted . So when I 'm fighting against the Skaarj enemies they will actually make an effort to jump out of the way of my shots . This was really cool to see and I really only found that in games like Half Life.The maps you have to navigate through are pretty massive at times . I really felt like a lot of the level design was also influenced by the great game Marathon . A lot of times in order to open a door you have to search out a series of levers , or whatever , in order to proceed onto the next section . This game literally has hours of game play and probably took me in the vicinity of 20 to 30 hours to complete , so you really get your moneys worth . The downfall to having such large maps is it 's kind of easy to get lost sometimes if you 're trying to complete certain tasks . Another detriment to the game was the lighting . I put this game on maximum brightness levels in order to help me see where I was going . Sometimes that was n't even bright enough . There are sections of this game that are absolutely dark , especially towards the end of the game . While this creates a very scary atmosphere , I felt it hindered the game play once in a while . The reason this hurts game play is because the flashlight function is incredibly annoying to deal with . You have to pick up flashlights or flares in order to see in the pitch black areas . Now to make it more realistic the flashlights eventually run out of batteries or something , but this was poorly incorporated because they only last a few minutes . Seriously , the flashlights in real life would NOT die so quickly and then it 's up to you to go find another one . The only reason this hurts the game is because if you no longer have light , you ca n't enjoy the environment nearly as much.Aside from a couple flaws this is a pretty awesome game and I had a lot of fun playing it . In '98 this came out around the same time as Half Life and they were both the must play FPS games that year . Half Life ultimately won the game of the year slot mainly because of story line . Unfortunately Unreal 's story line is pretty poor in the greater scheme of things . The user does n't really feel a greater purpose to their mission and instead you are merely trying to complete levels and puzzles . Whereas Half Life created a vastly well written world where you were trying to get out of a facility and stop an experiment gone out of control . Unreal just could n't compete with something of that caliber and it 's not nearly as engrossing on that level . Beautiful world and really fun to play overall , but not the best of the year.Overall Rating : 4.5 out of 5	1
This game is fun to play just for looking at all of the scenery . I enjoy all the brilliant colors and the array of monsters to kill . This is a Quake-type game but is better in everyway except the weapons . Just plain fun .	1
Really enjoyed this classic FPS . Hardcore gamers wont be disappointed . i highly recommend purchasing . Graphics are great , story-line is solid ( and not so short ) , audio is excellent and the price is right .	1
Unreal is one of those games that has stuck with me ever since I first played it . In fact , I ca n't think of any game that I actually like as much as Unreal . The environments are beautiful and compelling , the AI is fairly clever , and the atmosphere is simply masterful.In the singleplayer campaign , you are prisoner 849 . Your prison ship has crashed , and now you have to escape . When you leave the ship , you get slapped in the face with awe inspiring environments , excellent atmosphere , beautiful skies , and inspiring music . Instead of having cutscenes or cinematics , Unreal tells its story through translator messages . I prefer it that way - cutscenes would have gotten in the way.Unreal is also great for the fact that it supports CoOp - up to 16 players . The environments vary , but all of them are generally very well done . Aside from CoOp , Unreal also has deathmatch and team deathmatch modes , and a variety of others , such as DarkMatch . Unreal also comes with the Unreal Editor . In it , you can make your own levels . Admittedly , it 's difficult to get used to , but nevertheless , is an excellent addition . It IS marred with quite a few bugs , however.Unreal is a truly brilliant game . The environments , music , atmosphere , and story have made it last a very long time for me . It may have aged , but no game since has managed to grab my attention the way Unreal did , and no game has stuck with me for so long . My advice : buy the game . It 's brilliant .	1
I played unreal when I was 9 and beat it in a week.The game is just plain awsome . Unfortenutly that was 7 years ago and I doubt this will work on XP but when Im at his house I always play this amazing game . The begining is friggin scary when youre in the abandon space ship and all you hear are the lives of the sapce crew screaming and beging for there lives.Later you soon find out that they are being torn apart by these disturbing creatures or aliens I might say . More games should be like this.The only game to be like this would probably be The suffering cause you here the voices of the CO 's getting torn apart by weird disturbing creatures . Maybe not the only game but there a little few games that are like UNreal.The begining parts were the best for me . The scream the horror . I think this is suppose to be a survival horror game . I donno but Get this game but I think they dont make this game any more ? Any ways get this and UNREAL TURNEMENT . AWSOME GAMES !	1
The game may be old , but it 's still fun as hell . The scenery and graphics are really not that bad at all . Quite a change from `` traditional '' fps games ... which is definitely a good thing .	1
In my humble oppinion this game is better the Quake II . The graphics is better , and the sound is so much better . If you have a Sound Blaster Live ! card , then get this game , because it was designed to run on this card .	1
When the day I got unreal and tried it , I loved it so much I started calling up friends and telling them how incredible thatgame was , the gameplay is one of best gameplay ever experiencedin a game , you are a prisoner in a prisoner vessel headingto a prison moon believed to be called ( the prison ship ) : VortexRikers . But when the skaarj detect you and pull you on to the once peaceful planet of NaPali , then all goes wrong ! your best friend gets eaten by a skaarj , you barely manage to escape a now turned to a skaarj slaughter prison vessel , you reach outside grounds and say this ca n't be real , no it 's not , it 's UNREAL ! Unreal takes you through 39 heart beating , breath taking missions , where you fight for life to survive , collecting itemslike defenses and weapons , travel through temples , facilitys , castles , bases , mountians , journey through what napali has to offer , and end up and the skaarj mothers ship , confronting the queen skaarj ... ... .unaided and alone ! I would indenefinetley recommend this game to first person sci-fi fan shooters !	1
This game is so incredible , the graphics , the sound quality , the digital music , the gameplay , the AI , everything about it ... .When I first stepped outside of the prison ship using opengl support ( Using 3d hardware rendering on your 3d video card ) , along with 3dhardware support , sound quality at maxium , and using a pentium2 350 , tnt 3d video card , 128 sdram , and 16 mb of harddrive space , it ran incredible , it was UNREAL.But I 've been hearing about why 3dfx support from voodoo video cards looks so incredible , I 've been wondering that it 's more incredible that opengl or direct3d support.Still , this game { kicks behind } ! ! ! ! ! BUy it ! ! ! ! ! only 7 dollars today , stop by at eletronics boutique and buy this game ! ! ! ! ! ( I reccomend at least a shiny new pentium two , a whole lot of memory , for a example , 128mb of sdram , 6gs of harddrive space , and a powerful 3d sound card , and a 3d video card with lot 's of ram on it . )	1
This was a pretty good game , but not a great game . I 'd probably rate this closer to 3 1/2 stars . You are agent Craig Wilmore . Scully & amp ; Mulder have disappered and it 's your job to find them . You have several locations to go to and many people to talk to in your search . A couple of the features I really like was you actually have a shoot out that you control in one location and in another location , you have to do a real time search to catch the & quot ; bad & quot ; guys towards the end . Most of the cast members from the show are here ( Skinner , The Cigarette Smoking Man , & amp ; The Lone Gunmen ) , but they were n't used nearly enough . There were some cool explosions and the story was pretty good , but they could have made this a little harder in some aspects and a little easier ( like being able to get a password for your own computer . Why was this so hard ? ) . Overall , a good game , but just a few more additions and changes and this could have been a great game .	1
This was not the best mystery/adventure game I 've ever played , and I 'm not even a big fan of such games to begin with , but I am a serious X-Phile . Despite the seven CDs full of Full Motion Video than make up the game , it was n't a whole lot like being in an X-Files episode . Instead , it was more like being one of those & quot ; other agents & quot ; who make brief appearances two or three times per season . You actually have to do some of the tedious legwork to collect evidence instead of having it conveniently handed to you after the commercial break . Of course , the up side to that is a more immersive , believable feel to the game and a feeling of accomplishment when you finally do spot the crucial clue.Fans of the series will find plenty of references to themes , conspiracies , events , and trivia from various episodes , as well as the familiar faces . While it 's not strictly necessary to recognize all the references to the series in order to solve the mystery , it does add quite a bit to the game.If you 're not a fan of The X-Files , there are better mystery/adventure games out there . If you find mystery/adventure games frustrating , you probably wo n't like this one even if you are a fan . On the other hand , if you do enjoy both this type of game and the series it 's based on , you 'll have a lot of fun with this game .	1
We stopped watching the series ( lack of time ) and so this was a nice way to keep the excitement going . The game is good , perhaps a little disorienting at first . I spent the first hour sitting at Craig Willmore 's desk , doing nothing : ) Once you get the hang of it , though , it follows quite nicely . Because you have so much freedom in navigation ( you decide where to go , but things wo n't happen until you come back to the right place at the right time ) , it feels like the game is non-linear . In fact , it is rather linear , although you have a few variations . I was n't disappointed in the ending , but not thrilled either , it did n't blow me away . We got stuck a couple of times , but we managed to make it without a walkthrough in about a week.The rule of this game is SAVE OFTEN . And organize your saves . Keep the last save before you change CDs ( they correspond roughly to major developments ) . You might need to restart from there because you forgot to do something crucial . Or because you died ( I got killed a lot too ) . You need lots of frequent saves , and a few less recent , and a few even less recent not to have to restart from scratch if you believe you forgot something at the beginning of the game . But overall , the storyline is quite intuitive and you 'll be fine if you make connections.Buy this game if you like the series but you 're not a fanatic ( you 'd be disappointed ) . And you 'll have a good time if you can stand occasionally being stuck and turn it into a challenge rather than into a frustration .	1
I have had this game since 1999 . I really enjoy playing it . I have been playing it again and again off and on for few years now . I just recently decided to play it again . So I installed it on my Windows 7 professional 32 bit version computer . After doing the following compatibility for it works just fine on windows 7 professional . Install the latest quick time do not install the version on the cd . Also during install it looks for hard drive space since this was during a time that hard drive was not very big it will say there not enough hard drive space just hit ignore it will continue with the install . If you have Windows 7 Professional 32 bit version all I did was click compatibility run under Windows XP ( Service pack 3 ) and run this program as an administrator was all I checked . However if you have the windows 7 64bit version you will need to enable to run at the 32bit version level most likely .	1
I used to love this game ; but now it 's dated and now that I look back on it , it 's not as fun now , either way , here 's my review.Graphics : 8.5/10 . This is a more realistic snowboarding game , so there are very realistic colors ; unlike snowboarding kids or anything with very bright colors . 1080 features very realistic physics and is very sophisticated . Anyways , the graphics I remember loving mainly because of the powdery snow . I liked to edge in deep snow just because it was it was so fluffy . For that , this game got what it got in this category.Sound : 9/10 . Whether you go through a foot of snow or right accross jagged ice , there 's a different noise . There is a different sound for everything , which is strange because really for the most part in many games on the N64 there is the same or a very similar song for everything in the game.Control : 8/10 . Very , very realistic and solid , but It 's frustrating for that reason . it is really realistic so you really have to land FLAT to get land , which can be frustrating for little kids . There is also damage ; so if you get beat up a lot you will not win the race.Fun : 8.5/10 . Nice and realistic , great events , and different difficulties for every age and cool characters make this a must play for any owner of an N64.9/10	1
This game definitly fits the thought I had of a snowboarding game when I set out to buy one . The graphics are moderately realstic , the control is ok , and the sound is mediocre . I think they could of done a lot better job designing a game like this , but this edition suffices.It is one of the only snowboarding games on the N64 , which was one of the reasons i bought it . Another reason is the outstanding multiplayer coordination . I bought this as soon as I played it at a friend 's house . You unfortunatley play with only 2 players at a time , but it is still fun to play your friend head to head . There are 6 courses , and under single player you can also do half pipe and air make . There are 5 characters that you can use to race , and more of which you can unlock . since there are only 60 head to head course combinations , there are other things you can do , like trick or time attacks.This can take a bit to get used to , as it can be boring for the single player . If you have a will and a friend however , this game will surely be worth it .	1
In comparison to other N64 games , this piece is a worthwhile buy . The single player mode is challenging enough to warrant playing for a while to unlock the secret characters . Two player mode gets pretty boring , pretty quickly because there are only 6 tracks to race on so there 's not much variety . The stunt mode is the main appeal of the game and could easily occupy you for hours . However , it soon just becomes a thumb spinning frenzy for points . Given this is fun for a while but it gets all that white junk inside the control stick holder , and ruins thumb coordination for the rest of the day . So buy this game and spin in circles to your heart 's content .	1
The game in many ways is like tony hawk . In fact , the only differnt thing this snowboarding . The graphic and gameplay are good . With 5 differnt boarders to use and alot of tracks , the game is worth the money .	1
I 'm 23 now , got the game when it first came out when I was around 12 . Still the bet snowboarding game of all time . So much fun that I still get the n64 out here and there simply to play this game . Has a time attack mode , trick mode , racing series , and a mixture of them all . Just a great classic that rates up their with 007 Goldeneye for classic N64 games that could last forever for those every now and then gamers like myself . Great game ... that 's highly reccomended .	1
When my cousin first got this on his birthday , I was thinking & quot ; this is just gon na be like all the other snowboarding games I 've played & quot ; . Man was I wrong ! With 8 levels of exciting , heart stopping jump , twists and turns , this is one game you do n't wan na miss . It has all the best modes , Match Race & lt ; this is where you earn hidden levels against the computer & gt ; , 2 Player , Trick Attack , Time Attack , and Contest , this is one game that wo n't get tiring fast . Heed this warning : if you buy this game , do n't go after the 1080 just yet , it 's hard to master . What more do I have to say ? Buy this game !	1
Once you get the hang of the controls , this game is awesome ... it 's challenging and entertaining , and everyone should have one.This game has amazing graphics -- you can even see the snow spray off the board when you make the slightest turn . Plus , the camera controls are flawless . The sound track is pretty good , too- you can hear the snowboard scraping and the snowboarders sometimes talk , and the techo tracks that accompany the races are pretty cool too.My only complaint is that there are n't enough courses . After I unlocked the 6 courses and beat the & quot ; Black Diamond & quot ; level , there was n't much else to do . But even after you 've unlocked all the courses , it 's still fun to play against your friends in the 2 Person VS mode , or doing tricks in the half pipe.I think that anyone who has a N64 should add this game to their collection , without a doubt ... it 's a solid game , and you wo n't regret it .	1
Without any doubt , 1080 Snowboarding is probably the best snowboarding game available.The difficulty of the controls are a little more difficult than other snowboarding games and may take a little bit more time to master , but it 's well worth it . Landing correctly is also a little harder to do than normal.The mode and track selection is very nice , offering a nice variety of tracks and available modes . The tracks offer beautiful scenery , sometimes very big jumps , jumping over cars , and a lot more.The tricks and the stunts selection that you can perform is very reasonable . Although you ca n't go beyond 1080 degree turns , there are other tricks that you might not find in any other snowboarding game.1080 also includes a Training mode , which includes two different sections , the halfpipe and a straight run with moguls . When you begin , you can turn into the left gate for the halfpipe to practice your tricks , or you can head into the right gate for a straight downhill run with moguls scattered all over . When you finish , you start back up at the main gate and you keep going until you decide to quit.1080 also has a few secret riders and boards within the game.Overall , 1080 is probably the best snowboarding game around , without any doubt . Would be definitely worth buying .	1
This is the best Snow boarding game you can get but you will get tierd of it soon	1
I love the Nintendo 64 ! I still play some games occasionally and this one was always a fun one . It will frustrate you though !	1
Fans of any oldschool dungeon crawler should snap this game up . In a similar style to other games of the time , you assume the roll of a monster hunter with a mission to climb a mysterious tower following in your father 's footsteps.Some may say the graphics are dated . I feel that they are nostalgic . With randomly-generated dungeons , spelunking is always a grand adventure . A must-have for any RPG lover !	1
hard to find game most anywhere and only had the opportunity to rent it a while back and wanted to play again . a lot like D and D I was told .	1
9 out of 10 people will probably see this , and pass it up as another cheap RPG , for one thing you only have 1 dungeon ( gasp ) when you leve you level back down to 1 ( GAsp ) , and you capture monster just like in Pokemon ( GASP ) . No it 's not a compelation of rip off 's , this is a classic that is highly addicting , and incredibly fun , if given a chance.The story revolves around a young lad ( you name ) who on his fifteenth birthday is given the opportunity to become a hunter and explore the depths of the Monster Tower to retrieve riches , however to do so he must not only survive , but grow as a trainer and as a man . In comes the Kewe , the monster you will likely use for a majority of the game . He is a fire type ( there are only three types ) and he is your brief tutorial , and key to success early on ... . YOu also must build up your respect to the townsfolk , to do this you must enlarge certain places ( Temple , Hospital ) and build new things ( Library , Gym , Casino , Race Track , Bowling Alley ect.. ) and the town will grow to respect you.Now as for the tower it'self , there are 40 floors , everytime you leave you go back down to level 1 . No it 's not immpossible for two reasons.A ) Your monsters level stays the same when you leave , this is due to the fact that they are more like equipment.B ) Weapons and armors stay the same , when a red or blue sand is used your weapons and armor grow more powerful , so technically you can easily dominate the first few levels without you monsters assistance.Overall this game is tricky , you will die the first few times ( lose all your items except monsters ) but once they are strong enough you can succeed . There are 40 randomly changeing floors and they get more and more difficult as you go along . YOu must adjust your mosnters accordingly by class.A ) FireB ) WindC ) WaterFire beats Wind , Water beats Fire , Wind Beats Water.I would buy this for the challenge it possess , guarennteed addiction .	1
This is most likely one of the best N64 Games Ever made , Its way better then Super mario 64 in everyway ( and possibly Zelda too ) , its rich , colorful and very addicting , The soundtracks are also one of my favorite things about the game- it has a happy and also very awesome tune to them making them addictive ( you just cant stop listening to it ! ) , and the world designs ( 10 total I believe ) are all very Beautiful and Gorgeous , I 've beaten the game to 100 % and I still go back to the worlds and gaze in thier amazement , its just really cool , this game is a MUST HAVE for any Nintendo 64 player , Im serious if you dont have this , your missing out BIG time.PS . check out its Sequel Banjo-Tooie after you 've bought this !	1
I 've had this game since way back when it was released ; I just never got the chance to write a review.The Story : Banjo 's sister , Tooty , was `` the most beautiful girl around '' and Grunty the witch wanted her beauty , so she pulled an Amber Alert and took her to her lair . Banjo 's lazy bum the whole time was sleeping . It 's up to you to get jiggy 's and notes and what-not to stop Grunty and get Banjo 's sister back.Graphics : 9.5/10 . Awesomely different and creative worlds . From a sewer , to a pirate ship on an island , to a desert and into an icy snowland , there are tons of different and unique worlds to play through . The graphics are stellar for the N64 , with bright colors and cool characters with good animations . This is one of the best N64 games as far as graphics go next to games like Donkey Kong 64 and Legend Of Zelda : Majora 's Mask.Sound : 9/10 . There are n't really any voices in this game ; just kind of sound effects that are different for each character . Blubber on Treasure Grove Cove sounds like he 's burping or throwing up , Kazooie sounds like a gagging bird , Banjo sounds like a big old hick of a bear ... and so on . The music in this game , though , is some of the catchiest and the best music i 've heard in really any adventure game . The music does n't really get old , and whoever created it is brilliant . Overall , the sound is really , really good.Control : 8.5/10 . Being an adventure game , there are a lot of different controls for a lot of different moves . And since the N64 controller is the way it is ( pretty annoying ) it 's easy to get confused even after playing for hours on end , just because you go brain dead . The controls are a bit strange at first to do some of the attacks , but you will get used to them anyways.Fun : 9/10 . A great game from beginning to end . Get the jiggys , move on . Get the notes , move on . That simple ? No . This game is challenging and is for all ages , even if it does have a kiddy approach . The game lasts maybe 40 hours or so depending on how fast you get through the game . Great characters , great level design , and fantastic music makes this a must buy . This is one of the best games on the N64 , and I.M.O. , the best adventure game . Pick this game up now ; it is better than its sequel and the Game Boy Advanced ones , even if all three are fantastic . Buy this game ! ! 9.3/10	1
Rare just has an extraordinary knack at making great games . Banjo Kazooie was released in 1998 and has been considered a classic since , and I too must agree with this well deserved honor . Well , why do I find this game fantastic ? Well , I 'll explain that in my review.First off let 's talk about Banjo Kazooie 's story . Banjo 's sister Tooty is kidnapped by the wicked witch Gruntilda . Gruntilda has planned on swapping Tooty 's beauty to her , but not if Banjo and his friend Kazooie can help it ! Okay , seriously this story is pretty lame , but hey ! It 's a game . In My opinion , no matter how good the graphics are , or how great the story is , it all boils down to one thing . And that 's gameplay . And Banjo Kazooie has fantastic gameplay.In Banjo Kazooie you play as Banjo and ... well ... Kazooie , and Kazooie stays inside Banjo 's backpack at all times , but she 's not useless . They both work as a team and learn many moves , which brings us to our next character , Bottles . Bottles the mole helps you learn different moves to help you defeat Gruntilda and rescue Tooty . But do you just walk up to Gruntilda and save Tooty ? Not at all , there are several items to collect to defeat Gruntilda . The most important one is jiggies , there are ten jiggies in each world and you need several items to collect them . Along the way Bottles teaches you to use certain items , such as eggs to shoot through Kazooie 's mouth , or how to fly when you collect enough feathers . Another essential item to collect is mumbo tokens . Gruntilda has hidden mumbo tokens all around her enormous lair and if you collect enough you can visit the great shaman Mumbo Jumbo and he will transform you into different creatures to help you along your journey . So you have plenty to do in this game , I can guarantee that . Another essential item are music notes , in each world one hundred music notes are scattered all around and if you collect enough you can open new doors in Gruntilda 's massive lair . But I do find it to become quite tedious sometimes . Why ? You may ask . Because each time you leave and re-enter a world all the notes are still there , no matter how many you 've collected . Let 's say you 've collected ninety-nine out of the hundred possible music notes to collect , well if you leave the world and re-enter , you would have to collect all ninety nine notes again , you could n't go searching for the one music note you had n't collected . And while yet this situation is highly unlikely , it 's still annoying no matter how many notes you have to re-collect . Fortunately , if you do n't care about collecting all one hundred music notes , you do n't have to because the game automatically saves the amount you 've collected.There are n't too many moves to learn in Banjo Kazooie , and it did n't take me long to master them . And there are n't many control problems , actually the controls are almost perfect . But I did get frustrated with a feature that was not added in the game , I wish Banjo could hang on to ledges , there was many times in Clanker 's Cavern where I could almost reach a ledge , but it was just barely out of reach because I could n't hang on to the ledge . While yet this was n't too big of a deal , I think that feature could of made the game a little less frustrating . I was also very pleased with camera control , there are three angles to choose from except in a few rare areas and I found it easy to maneuver.I told you this game was made in 1998 , right ? Well the graphics are terrific . The different atmospheres to this game make it twice more enjoyable . You can relax in broad daylight in Treasure Trove Cove , or wonder at dark in Mad Monster Mansion . And I thought the last world Click Clock Wood was absolutely brilliant , it 's a forest and you collect jiggies in the four season 's spring , summer , fall and winter . I especially loved Freezeezy Peak , and it was so much fun climbing the huge snowman.I also loved the music in this game , each beat is catchy and it never got repetitive for me , and the sound effects were great as well ... well the only complaint I could have is that there is no dialogue in the game , but I actually found the weird sounds from the characters kind of funny and I loved the insults between Kazooie and Bottles and Gruntilda 's rhymes cracked me up , that 's another reason I love this game , it has such a charm to it , not like some newer games , to many games have steered away from being innocent and charming , and this game has this quality.What more can I say ? This game is fun to play , it has great replay value , the music , sounds and the worlds all sound and look absolutely fantastic and the difficult final fight with Gruntilda at the end was indeed terrific as well . It took me thirty hours to complete ( without a guide ) and I had so much fun solving puzzles and this game can test your mind at certain times . I will admit I did need help online for a few jiggies , but the ending sequence makes the occasional frustrations all worthwhile , very satisfying if you ask me . I 'm now very anxious to play Banjo Tooie , as it 's been claimed to be even better than the original . Banjo Kazooie is highly recommended , this game is indeed a classic .	1
If you own a N64 and are looking for a game to play , go to your local game store and find Banjo-Kazooie ! In my opinion , this game is simply amazing . The main plot throughout the game is that Banjo the bear and his faithful breegull sidekick Kazooie are attempting to rescue Banjo 's little sister Tootie from the evil witch Gruntilda . Enjoy the game as you explore 10 exciting worlds , collect numerous puzzle pieces ( open worlds ) , and rescue your sister from the evil clutches of Gruntilda .	1
Great game !	1
If Mario 64 was good than Banjo was Mario perfected.Amazing game.Another gem from years ago that I played start to finish multiple times.Amazing levels.Perfect control.Great but hokey music.Some people were annoyed by the `` voices '' .I thought they were hilarious.The camera does get a little crazy here and there but this was 3D platforming in it 's beginning and really , the camera is about as perfect as a 3D platforming camera can be.To summarize ... Great gameplay.Awesome graphics for the time.An ending riddle that had me looking for a way in for weeks on end . ( A real bummer that the two games DID N'T link after all ) .That 's probably the biggest disappointment that all those mystery areas were never revealed by the N64.Otherwise ... .another great platformer from the golden age of platforming , collect a thons.Highly recommended .	1
Developer Rare is a master at infusing originality into their imitations . This is n't a knock against them . William Shakespeare pulled stories and plots from other writers and crafted masterpieces . Rare is gamedom 's Shakespeare , in that regard . Banjo-Kazooie is obviously influenced by Super Mario 64 , although it 's always unfortunate for a game to be compared to that masterpiece . While Banjo-Kazooie lacks Super Mario 64 's magic and ingenuity , it has its own magic that sets it apart from Nintendo 's behemoth.The Good : + A fun story+ An imaginative use of its characters+ Creative worlds to exploreThe Bad : -- Too easy and short -- The few parts that are too hardThe Ugly ? Why is Kazooie so insulting ? Story -- 9/10The first thing that stands out is the dialogue , especially of the evil witch , Gruntilda , or Grunty , who speaks in clever rhymes . It 's refreshing all the more that what she says is often funny . The game begins with her asking her mirror , `` Who is the most beautiful of them all ? '' Of course , it could n't be Gruntilda . There 's nothing even remotely pretty about a fat , green hag . The most beautiful of them all is Banjo 's younger sister , Tooty ( who looks similar to Tiny Kong of Donkey Kong fame ) . So Grunty sets off to kidnap Tooty and succeeds , leaving only the mole , Bottles , as a witness . Bottles must survive a downpour of Kazooie 's insults and witticisms to explain the kidnapping to Banjo and Kazooie . The question becomes , can Banjo and Kazooie save Tooty before Grunty robs her of her beauty and transfers it to herself ? Gameplay -- 8/10Here is the game 's bane and boon . Everything else sets it up wonderfully . The soundtrack is great , the visuals are very nice , and the opening story sequence is funny . The game controls smoothly and you have plenty of moves to learn and use throughout . The levels are varied , with plenty of collectibles and other goodies to discover . But these levels are so small , so short , so easy . I never spent an hour and a half on any one level , and most of them took less than an hour to complete . In that time , I could collect ten jigsaw puzzle pieces , one hundred musical notes , and numerous other items such as the Mumbo Jumbo skulls , extra lives , and Jinjos . Compared to Super Mario 64 , I ca n't help but say , is that all ? There are a total of nine worlds , as well as a main hub world , which is too labyrinthine for its purpose . Rare goes a little overboard as to the amount of collectibles they expect gamers to gather . Unless you use cheats , it takes 94 out of the 100 Jigsaw pieces total to unlock every single world , including the final fight with Grunty . That 's not too difficult , as I 'd say about 97 of those Jigsaw pieces are a piece of cake . More than 880 of the 900 music notes are needed in order to give you somewhat of a chance against the unfairly difficult fight with Grunty ( you just ca n't count on Rare to make a strictly children 's game : see Diddy Kong Racing ) .These are mostly criticisms , but they comprise a small percent of the game . You will spend most of it enjoyably . Despite the very easy difficulty , it is n't boring . There 's plenty to explore in the levels , and as they go on , they become larger and more complex , especially the sprawling final level . Rare flexes all of its creative muscles in that level , revolving around the four seasons , and even includes a few semi-stories with some new characters . Not that the other levels are clunkers , but if only they could provide the same sort of entertainment , the rest of the game would have been that much more enjoyable.Longevity -- 5/10A game should only be as long as it needs to be , but I think Banjo-Kazooie needed to be a little longer . Considering what Nintendo did years earlier in Super Mario 64 , it 's no excuse that Rare could n't match that level of magnitude . But it 's unfair to compare any game to Super Mario 64 . Most gamers will complete this , all 100 Jigsaw pieces , almost all 900 music notes , in less than twelve hours . After finishing it , there 's no reason to go back . The cheats only give you infinite resources , but what 's the point when you 've already finished the game ? The only way a game like this can extend its life is for the single player adventure to be a little longer .	1
This is one game that will test your skills , on how to figure things out , but if you want to take the easy way out you can always get bottles the neer sighted mole 's help . One thing i like about this game is that when Bottle & Kazooie confront each other they always throw smack at each other which makes the storyline more funnier . This is a pretty cool game , it 's worth buying . I had fun playing it , i will buy it.If you liked this game check out all of the other Banjo & Kazooie games .	1
One of the best games on the N64 , it combines action , adventure , puzzle and other elements as you go through awsome based levels to beat it .	1
Goldeneye 007 , Killer Instint , The Donkey Kong Country series , Conker , Diddy Kong Racing ... .those were the good ol ' days when Rare was still relevant . Before they sold their souls to Microsoft and lost all credibility . And in my opinion , the peak of Rare was with the Banjo games ( kazooie & tooie ) on Nintendo 64 . Kazooie , to me , defines the N64 3-D platformer . While many will say Mario 64 , which is a near perfect game . I think the Nostalgia sometimes forgets how much BETTER Banjo Kazooie was . Back in '98 rare was on a roll . This game was yet another grandslam . A brand new franchise , cut from scratch . And it 's absolutely amazing . I wo n't go into all the details and story as my fellow reviewers have already made clear . All I can add is this game is easily one of the best games of the late 90 's . It was a game I picked up and loved immediately . My only question is WHAT the **** happened to rare ? ! ! They were so amazing with Nintendo , then dropped bomb after bomb for the X-Box consoles . I 'm not a Nintendo fanboy , so do n't even go there . But Rare took a big dookie all over this series with the newer games on Microsoft consoles . The 1998 game will always be the best . And I hope someday the brothers who originally ran Rare will comeback to bring the infamous `` Banjo Threeie '' to life on any console ! !	1
Positive : + gameplay is very deep with new elements added all the time+ worlds are very diverse and have a lot of content+ music tracks are great and change in style when you 're in different spots+ sharp controls that work well for the most partNegative : - you have to start your note count every time you re-enter a world- camera does n't always give you the best view you needSuper Mario 64 revolutionized the 3-D platformer ; and the amount of people who would deny that are probably fewer than the words in this sentence . But when a revolution comes , what 's the point of it being so revolutionary unless something comes of it later on ? In video games , a game is a revolution indeed when other games take the basic model and take it to a whole new level , and possibly delivering a game that 's even better than the root . Whether it really is a beneficiary of the beloved Mario 64 or Rare is just really , really good at making games , that is where we find Banjo-Kazooie.Games of the platforming genre are n't exactly known for their amazing stories , and Banjo fares no different . Banjo 's little sister Tooty is kidnapped by the stereotypical green witch Gruntilda . She has some sort of weird machine that will supposedly transfer Tooty 's beauty to herself , and this will leave Banjo 's poor sister ugly in the process ! So Banjo and his grumpy bird friend Kazooie ( who for some reason lives in Banjo 's backpack ) set out to Gruntilda 's lair to save Tooty . The story does n't take itself very seriously at all but there 's a great , humorous tone to it that more than makes up for the lack of depth.The game does n't move from place to place at all ; the whole thing takes place in Gruntilda 's huge lair , key word being 'huge . ' This one location is just so big but perfectly balanced with the ease of traversing that it makes the perfect setting for a platforming game . There is a whole lot of variety within the mountain lair , with a sewer , swamp , graveyard , and many other spots . The areas of different theme will almost always take you to one of the game 's nine worlds , which are all big , diverse , and have a lot of stuff to find . You 'll find yourself at a mountain to begin the game , then moving on to a beach , and later a snow area and haunted mansion-like world , and so on . The game never really runs out of new material to throw at you , which is really nice , even if most of the themes are found in many other games of the genre , too.Another way Banjo always keeps itself fresh is with the moves you can learn . In most of the levels you can find a mole named Bottles who will teach you a new move if you can find him . These moves are sometimes confined to certain spots or items you can put on , and they all work together perfectly to make the game progress logically . You have to unlock some of these abilities , such as flight and invincibility , to get deeper into Gruntilda 's lair , and also to accomplish more in the worlds . The game controls very well too , even with all the added moves , and it does n't get too complicated . One issue though is with the camera , which you can control the angle of but you still sometimes ca n't get the viewpoint that 's just right for a room or area.But the core of the game stays the same , no matter how many moves you learn or different worlds you visit . The main objects to collect are jiggies , which are basically pieces of jigsaw puzzles that , when put together , open the door to a new world . Ten of these can be found in each level along with 100 notes , which open up doors to new areas of the lair . Unfortunately the game 's note total is merely a combined high score of how many notes you collect in each level ; each time you re-enter a world the note count restarts . This is pretty annoying sometimes , and it would have been nice to just keep all the notes so you do n't have to recollect all of them again to advance your total note count . Thankfully the jiggies are extremely well-balanced as far as how hard they are to get ; in the first world most of them are sitting on the ground like Easter eggs , but as you progress through the game you have to work much harder to earn your way to more worlds.Graphically Banjo kept up to date well enough . The visuals are just a tad choppy , but they still look good enough , and that sort of thing happened all the time in the N64 era . Sometimes objects that are a little ways away wo n't appear on screen until you get closer , which thankfully does n't prove to be too annoying but still would be good if fixed . Despite these few flaws , though , the graphics look great considering the times.One of Banjo 's shining areas aside from gameplay is the sound . The characters speak in a gibberish sort of language ( with text shown on the bottom of the screen ) and this might annoy some but it 's still good to add personality to each character . The sound effects are all good too , no complaints there . The really cool part of the sound , though , is the music . The tracks are cool enough as they are , but when you 're standing on a different spot or in a different area , like if you 're under water or at the entrance to a different world , the music style and sound totally changes while keeping the same song . Then as you exit the spot the music transitions back to the normal style , and this effect may sound small without actually hearing it but trust me when I say it 's really , really cool.Mario 64 may have been the revolution , but some of the games that derived bits and pieces from it were possibly even better , in my opinion . Banjo-Kazooie is one such game , adding a lot of depth and value to an already proven formula . It may not be the game everyone looked to for inspiration in the game-making world , but Banjo-Kazooie is a real gem from Rare 's glory days on the N64 , and it makes me want to play the sequel even if it is ten years old.Gameplay : 9.5Graphics : 8.5Sound : 9.5Camera & Control : 8.5Value : 9.5FINAL SCORE : 9.2/10	1
Banjo Kazooie is a game I 've played many times since I got it in the early 2000s and while its fun , its not the most entertaining game I 've played . There 's two main objectives in Banjo Kazooie : hunting and gathering . You hunt for these jigsaw pieces called Jiggys to help you complete jigsaw puzzles to open worlds . You gather all sorts of items within each level like musical notes , Jinjos , Mumbo tokens , feathers , etc . This concept gets boring after awhile but nevertheless the game is pretty fun as a whole . I 'd recommend the sequel , Banjo Tooie , instead as its 10 times more entertaining .	1
All in all , this is the best platform game that I have played in a long time . Of course , it follows the basic formula of a platformer - kidnapped female , evil castle , jump on enemies , etc . But the reason the formula still exists is due to the fact that , occasionally , it works really well . Banjo-Kazooie is a case where the cliche works to perfection . Although we question Nintendo 's blatant violation of the genetic cloning ban put in place by the president , they did so for a good cause , and a damn good game .	1
Like Super Mario and Donkey Kong this game is a classic . The good gameplay and graphics pay off . This is worth the money .	1
Banjo-Kazooie is one of my favorite games , and it works perfectly after all these years and being shipped around the country . perfect .	1
This game is fantastic . Personally , I love it . Have you ever played a game where an evil witch is ugly and wants to be evil so she steals a beautiful girl named Tooty to try and transfer the beauty to the ugly witch ? Also , have you ever played a game where a bear and bird have to collect golden puzzle pieces , musical notes , dinosaurs mixed with teddy bears named Jinjos ? Also , have you ever played a game where a shaman transforms the bear and bird into various forms ? Well , if you have n't , this is where to start . This game is perfect for all ages . I would recommend this game to anyone who has a N64 .	1
I 've never really had enough of an attention span to play `` collect the item '' games , but this particular one is really great . It has enough action and puzzle involved to hold the attention of even a gamer like me ( with , honestly and unfortunately , a terribly short attention span ) for hours at a time , with enough elements of finding things you 'll need later to keep you playing and replaying each level . A truly great game , and I wish more of the sort were made these days . I feel way too young to be saying this , but they just do n't make them like this anymore ! On a side note , the cartridge I received has some ... Interesting connections . I 'd guess the previous owner loved and played it as much as I do haha .	1
This is one of the best games out there , it 's a classic . Banjo-Kazooie is one of the rarest and hard to find games ever , The story is really good . A witch kidnaps a beautiful girl and wants to be the prettiest of them all . Her brother and his pal Kazooie have to save her . While its a relatively easy it can still be hard in some places and there are cheat codes to help you along the way with things like Gold feathers , Red feathers and Eggs . However if you quit and save your game then the cheat has to be reentered . While the game does have it 's flaws its still really fun to play . The game essentially is very easy next to its sequel game , Banjo Tooie . The levels all relatively easy , however it is very easy to die in this game , on top of that like other reviewers on Amazon have said about dying and losing notes and recollecting them is toldly true . Clarkers Cavern was the worst because you only have 6 things of air and have to get extra air , from a fish blowing bubbles . The level that is the most challenging of them all was Click Clock Wood . Because of going from the changing seasons and having to grab notes from all seasons that was tough for me . However the most challenging and difficult part of this game , is beating Grunty herself . That is the most challenging part of this game . because you have to hit her with eggs and unfortunately its a huge flaw on Rare 's part for not putting a homing shooter like they do in the sequel game . Overall despite it 's many flaws Nintendo and Rare have done an excellent job making a game that is graphically pleasing , and the gameplay is awesome . Buy it you wo n't regret it .	1
This is one of my all time favorite games . The characters are likeable , with hilarious dialogue and an intriguing story . Also the music is some of the best I 've ever heard in a video game . Also , the graphics and sound are great for N64 . The controls are CRAZY precise for N64 , and MAN is this game challenging ! There are lots of secrets to uncover and special power ups to unlock . If only Microsoft had n't ruined Rare ...	1
Now that Banjo & Kazooie is over five years old a sequel now exist and there is likely another game coming . HOPEFULLY ! The game only for the N64 is one of the most amazing platformers ever . In fact it 's one of the most amazing games in any genre period . It took a while to beat the game , but it was well worth it . If your not familiar with B & K , let me explain.. Banjo is a bear with a handy backpack . Kazooie is a bird who hangs out in Banjo 's backpack . With the many special moves Kazooie pops out of the pack quite a bit . Together they work through many HUGE levels collecting items like puzzle pieces ( 100 hidden through out the entire game ) , musical notes ( 100 on each level ) , little Jinjo people ( 5 on each level ) , there are also Mumbo skulls to find , they allow you ( once you have the required amount ) to change form , you must visit the mumbo skull guy quite often . Changing form is mandatory , for instance B & K can not fit into some smaller places . Turning into an ant allows you to go into a small hole where prizes are not reachable otherwise . Vast and adventurous , B & K is impossible to dislike even if your not a fan of platformers . Even if your just watching , it 's entertaining . I 'll give you an idea of how effective the story is . BANJO & KAZOOIE is THE WIZARD OF OZ of vidoe games .	1
I have never played anything like this since . Everything from Sly Racoon , to Ratchet and Clank , owe it to this.Wicked witch Gruntilda takes Banjo 's sister to hey layer , miles away in a realistic 3D cartoon world.Banjo is a bear with Kazooie a bird in his backpack that can help him jump and fly and basically you learn to do lots of things with it . You solve puzzles via action and collect tolkens across lovely maps . Mumbo Jumbo transforms Banjo into some other creatures along the way . You can fly . It was amazing . A full adventure all the way to end . We played it for months and I have NEVER played anything like it again . The makers of Donkey Kong released it at the best time . It is now up to the future generations to make adventure concepts better than this one . This is one of the best N64 games ever .	1
There is not much I can say except this is THE BEST GAME FOR N64 . Not too easy , not too hard , tons of levels and objectives and the cutest cast of characters ( Jinjos rock ) If you like adventure games , Banjo-Kazooie is for you !	1
Banjo-Kazooie is an action adventure game in the style of Super Mario 64 . However , it is similar , yet also quite different . Rather than having most of the skills you need at the beginning of the game , you learn a few in the very beginning , and then learn the remaining skills throughout the first six worlds ( there are nine , but they are much larger than the fifteen in Mario 64 ) . Notes are like coins , and jiggies are like stars . However , rather than six stars in each world , there are 10 jiggies to find in each world , and 10 in the witch 's castle ( much like the castle secret stars ) . Also , you can transform in five of the nine massive levels with the help of the crazy witch doctor Mumbo-Jumbo . Generally , it will help you get at least 1 Jiggy in the world , and they can do things that Banjo and Kazooie ca n't on their own . Throughout the game , you get to transform into a termite ( level 1 ) , an alligator ( level 4 ) , a walrus ( level 5 ) , a pumpkin ( level 7 ) , and a bee ( level 9 ) .The nine massive worlds are each very different from eachother . But how fun are they ? Well , they 're all very fun to play in , mainly because the tunes in each world really match the mood , from eerie funeral dirges to peppy shipyard music , this game has that and then some . Overall , I highly recommend it . If you read my previous review of the game Banjo-Tooie , you 'd see why I enjoyed the sound effects so much . Once more , I highly recommend this game .	1
This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my daughter but since she was home for the holiday week-end I had her check it out . Everything works great .	1
After Rareware turned GoldenEye into a system-seller for the Nintendo 64 , it broke out again with the action-platformer Banjo-Kazooie . An ugly old witch named Gruntilda has taken Banjo 's sister Tootie and plans to suck the beauty out of her . Banjo and Kazooie ( the bird that lives in his backpack ) must brave Gruntilda 's fortress to get Tootie back.The plot is a little sugary and kiddie , but it 's really just an excuse to send gamers on a Mario 64-style adventure , where completing tasks and puzzles in worlds will open up new worlds to explore . Yes it 's pretty much a clone of Mario , but at the same time it refines and enhances the Mario formula . Players have more unique special moves at their disposal , and these are much more essential to navigating the environment and solving puzzles . Worlds are beautiful , creative , and expansive , tossing you into a room with a giant shark , a huge snowman , or a forest where you can actively move between the seasons . It 's all topped by memorable music that changes to fit the environment , fades , or grows louder depending on where you are in the stage.This is a game that has aged gracefully . Yes it 's on an old system , but the art design and music still hold up well like the classic Mario titles , and gameplay is solid . A masterful experience thats supplemented quite well by its sequel , Banjo Tooie .	1
OMGosh ! ! . . My son .. grandson .. and great-grandson . . all three are totally enjoying this game soooooo much . I 'm not any kind of a game player but it makes me feel so good just watching their enjoyment . Thank you for a product that is not full of all that blood and gore that so many of the games have now days .	1
Banjo-Kazooie is a game that did n't really appeal to me at first . It looked to childish , to easy , and just basically stupid . Comming from the epic company Rareware , I was a bit more interested in what this game was about . Seeing so many good reviews and so many possitive aspects , I realized I must give this game a try . Well , was I ever lucky to do so . Keeping with the Mario 64 type control style and the amazing graphics , I could n't put the game down . Even though the game was kiddie looking and very childish too , it was really placed for us people who love adventure games . The little things , such as the mini games , make this game even better than it already was . Imagine running around in the snow in a race against a sleding polar bear or playing follow the leader with a giant ghost hand . These are only a few of the things you can do in the game . The game flows a little different than Mario fans might be used to ; you have many things to collect . For starters , your main objective is to find all the Jiggys on a level so you can gain access to all other levels . Also , music notes are needed to break the witches spell on doors throughout her lair . And even little guys called Jinjo 's are here for you to collect , so they can help you on your journey , through a forest , islands , deserts , and many other worlds . If you have seen a Rare game , you know that they have good graphics , so no exception here , very well done . The music is also a plus feature on this game . With so many great reviews by people of all ages and sexes , you would be doing yourself a great disjustice by not buying this game .	1
Rareware - words fail me . Again they have made a quality title beyond imagination . Creative beyond a shadow of a doubt . 95 % of people agree , that Banjo-Kazooie is a landmark title with everything the N64 has to offer , and that it is worthy of 5 out of 5 stars . While developed early in N64 's lifespan , the graphics stand out beyond many titles recently released . The sound is equally as impressive ( for N64 ) , and the game has been cleverly melded with it to make you feel as the atmosphere of the game has changed , depending on your situation.I am proud to say many people love this game . Many of my friends still play it occasionally , however few have beaten it all the way . This game is solid for 50+ hours of gaming , but only when you are willing to get every last puzzle piece and musical note , and every other item . Some people dislike it , and do not be fooled ; a 27 year male old who listens to ultra-hard rock and loves games with extreme violence and/or nudity will NOT like this game . It is by no means for everybody . Many gamers , from preschool to high school will like it , but not everybody.The controls are easy enough to master , and any avid or casual gamer will easily master them with a little practice . The sound is superb . The graphics are good , for an N64 title . There is not a dull moment in this game , and the attention to detail is amazing . The puzzles , the meat of the game , are easy enough for older kids to have a challenge and not to hard for younger kids . The puzzle peices , your reward for completeing a puzzle , are well hidden . The musical notes , the only way to advance to the next portion of the overworld , are challenging to find . The most fun part of the game , visiting Mumbo , is quite enjoyable . He transforms you into various forms . A fat walrus , a termite , and even a bumble bee . There is n't really an advancing story , but that 's okay . You get an occasional cinematic , but it 's pretty basic.The story goes ... The evil witch , Gruntilda , is happily hanging out atop her mountain WHEN ... The `` cute '' Tootie , sister of Banjo the bear , strolls by . Overcome with jealousy , she sees Tootie is quite a bit `` cuter '' than her . So she kidnapps Banjo 's sister and creates a machine to suck Tootie 's `` cuteness '' out and put it into her . Banjo and his sidekick breegull , Kazooie set off to find Tootie . A mole named Bottles helps them learn some new moves to defeat various obsticles in the game.Well , I hope you enjoy this game . Thanks for reading this review , and until next time ... CRIMSON|RED	1
this is the best n64 game ever made next to the wonderful ocarina of time.i beat everything in it when i was 9-i collected all the jinjos , got all the puzzle pieces , etc.i bought it when i was 8.it 's an amazing , fun game.i just feel tormented that i had to use the players guide to beat the 2nd , banjo-tooie.i try not to think about it.but this game is extremly hard and grueling-but in a good way.the levels are extremly detailed and fun.my favorite is the graveyard/haunted house level . ( i forgot it 's name . ) buy it.i command you .	1
I 'm so glad I was able to buy this game at a great price . I really enjoyed reliving my childhood .	1
First off I 've only owned two Crash Games . The first Crash Bandicoot and Wrath of Cortex for the PS1 . I played a demo for Warped on my Spyro the dragon game and wanted it ever since . I bought it on Amazon and its safe for me to say that ... THIS IS THE CRASH I KNOW AND LOVE ! ^_^For those who do n't know Crash Bandicoot first came out in the 90 's as a standard , straight-forward platformer . You 're a mutated Bandicoot named Crash who escapes from the evil mad scientist Dr.Neo Cortex and must go back to save your girlfriend . In Warped Dr. Cortex now works for Uka Uka ( The brother of Aku Aku ) an evil mask that wants to destroy crash and take over the world . He instructs Cortex to go through time and collect Crystals and Gems that hold extreme power . Crash has to literally race through time and jump , spin , and dance his way through time to retrieve them before Cortex gets ahold of them.This game is just as fun as the first one . It brought me back to a time where video games concentrated more on gameplay and content rather than graphics which games today seem to concentrate almost too much on . The controls are spot on . You can build momentum for jumps , move in any direction , and really I never had problems with the controls even in the first Crash . One thing I REALLY love about this one is that I do n't feel bad when I die ! This game has some really interesting death scenes rather you 're forcibly kissed by a frog that changes into a prince , eaten by lions , thrown into the screen by a two-headed fat person , or so on . When I finish the game I plan on seeing how many ways I can die : ) Some worlds replicate each other but are harder and take more and more skill to get through . The boss battles are really diverse and take strategy , timing , and skill to get rid of . I must confess I found the first boss and 2 worlds extremely easy . Its not until the 3 that the game just goes `` F*** this ! I 'm gon na make your time a living hell '' ! Its still way easy so far compared to the first game though which really did what I said above . I also noticed something that first caught my attention in Wrath of Cortex . The game seems extremely open when it comes to lives . Seriously I 'm not even half way through the game and all ready up to 50 almost . I guess I 'm that good at playing . Im definately buying the second one.I admit I 'm disappointed at the way the turn the series have made . I wish they kept it as a patformer and just added maybe some adventure elelments to it like they did Twinsanity ( even though its glitchy as hell ) . Naughty Dog where did you go ? Crash Bandicoot Warped is just what I expected it to be . Its funny , addicting , challenging and overall just shows graphics do n't make the game , but its content and gameplay .	1
This is one of my favorite games of all time . In this game , there are 30 different levels that are mostly composed of the same 3D Crash levels that we 're used to . Some levels , however , you get to use a biplane , motorcycle , or Jet Ski . Like the previous versions of Crash , you have to collect crystals and gems . Now , you can also collect a relic for having the best time . The music is fun , the controls are easy and it 's just an overall great game for any age .	1
I am shocked and *very* pleased to report that Crash Bandicoot 3 : Warped is a DRASTIC improvement over the original Crash Bandicoot.As you may have heard , I am definitely NOT a fan of the very first Crash Bandicoot game released for the Sony Playstation in 1996 . I am , however , incredibly surprised to find that Crash Bandicoot 3 : Warped is actually a really fun adventure game that may have been slightly overlooked at the time of its release because of the seemingly never-ending amount of wonderful games released for the Playstation in 1998.Just so you know , I ca n't compare Warped to Crash Bandicoot 2 : Cortex Strikes Back because I have n't played that one . I can only compare Warped to the original Crash Bandicoot.Before playing Crash 3 , I was almost CERTAIN that Crash Bandicoot was an overrated video game character because my first and only exposure to Crash was the very first game . I thought for sure Crash Bandicoot was either a Mario or an Earthworm Jim rip-off , and did n't deserve all the attention it got.For 10 years the original was the only Crash Bandicoot game I knew , and truth be told , it was a pretty average game because every stage featured basically the same uninspiring , repetitive island environment where the object was to run to the end of every stage collecting berries and smashing all the boxes as a way to earn more lives and receive a better overall percentage.Simply put , Crash 's very first outing was BORING . It desperately needed variety . Walking through island/jungle stages all the time can only provide so much fun before it inevitably gets boring . The creators of Crash Bandicoot must have realized how boring this formula was because Warped does just the opposite- Warped features nothing BUT creativity . In Warped every stage certainly does NOT have the same feel . You will encounter something drastically different in every stage . I like that.The main objective of Crash Bandicoot 3 : Warped is to find the purple gem found in each of the 25 stages of the game . You HAVE to find all 25 purple gems otherwise the game wo n't allow you to fight the boss at the end of the world you 're in . For example , if you 're in World 4 , and ca n't find the purple gem in stage 3 , you wo n't be allowed to face the boss at the end of that world . You 're stuck there until you find that darn purple gem . Once you find the gem , and face and defeat the boss , you move on to the next world and repeat the process of collecting one purple gem per level and face the boss . By the way , there 's 5 worlds total and 5 stages in each world . That comes to 25 stages total.The amount of creativity that went into each of the 25 stages is simply incredible . Unlike the first Crash Bandicoot game where you mainly just spin around through a jungle environment breaking boxes and jumping over cracks in the ground , Warped offers a LOT more in the way of variety . In Warped you will encounter a few motorcycle racing stages ( where you 're required to get first place so you can receive the purple gem ) , a couple underwater stages ( with VERY neat-looking backgrounds and deadly , puffy fish swimming about ) , a couple levels where you 're steering an airplane and required to shoot down blimps and other airplanes , and not to mention those tricky , tiger-riding stages.Oh , and I HAVE to mention the ultra-cool futuristic robot stages ( which require near-perfect jumping patterns in order to complete ) . The Jet Ski stages are really fun because you 're located on top of the ocean and I guarantee you will have the time of your life jumping over ramps while avoiding those floating bombs . Yup , it 's awesome . This is what makes Crash Bandicoot 3 so great- you wo n't know WHAT to expect until you enter the level.Probably the worst thing about Crash Bandicoot 3 : Warped is the fact that the game offers little in the way of challenge . That 's not to say the game is a cakewalk , either . People who think Warped is an easy game are only comparing the challenge to the previous two Crash Bandicoot games . If you compare Warped to say , I do n't know , Spyro the Dragon , it 's not such an easy game then . It 's definitely not a hard game either . You WILL beat it . I think the challange is comparable to Super Mario Bros. 1 , the old NES classic.The one thing I find challenging in Warped is the boss battle in World 3 where you 're required to jump over bombs and laser beams heading in your direction . This is one case where practice does n't necessarily make perfect . Also the second airplane stage can be a challenge if you do n't bother shooting down the enemy planes.One thing about Crash Bandicoot 3 : Warped that IS incredibly easy is the object of finding those purple gems . Most of the time you can NOT miss those gems , because you basically walk right into them on your way to reaching the end of the stage . I mean , they are always RIGHT THERE . RIGHT in front of you ! After you complete a stage , you can always go back to it and the computer will then give you a new option to complete the level in a certain amount of time . Finishing the stage in a certain amount of time is actually quite hard . It means you *really* have to take off running and not stop for a single moment to smash a box or spin-attack an enemy or ANYTHING . It means you have to run run RUN ! Just so you know , completing the stages under a certain time is NOT a requirement . It 's entirely up to you if you 'd like to accept the challenge . I 'm too much of a wimp to accept it , personally.I like how you can save your game after you complete a stage . You can actually complete one stage and go to the save room , if you wish . Very convenient . Oh , and get this- if during the middle of the game you decide you want to stop playing and shut off the Playstation , when you come back to the game later all the lives you collected up to that point will STILL be there ! I ca n't think of any other game that will save all the lives you collect . Speaking of lives , they are *so easy* to find in Warped that you probably can collect up to 45 of them . That 's a lot , and you will probably need them because , even though the challenge ranges from low to medium , your first time through the game wo n't be THAT simple.When Crash gets hit or smashed by something , I think it 's funny the way he yells `` whoa ! '' It reminds me of that comedian Carrot Top.The reason Crash Bandicoot 3 : Warped is n't going to receive a 5-star rating from me is because of the same problem found in Spyro the Dragon- in the flying stages ( in this case , the airplane stages ) when you hit down on the D-pad the airplane flies UP , and hitting up will make the airplane go DOWN . The game company made the direction the wrong way ! Oops . At least when you steer the airplane left , it will go left . The same with right . Unfortunately , many game makers have made , and continue to make , the same mistake . It needs to be corrected once and for all.I realize having your airplane fly up when you hit `` down '' on the d-pad is an example of realism since that 's more or less how REAL airplanes operate , but the thing is , Crash Bandicoot is n't supposed to be about realism since it 's just a platform adventure game , and furthermore , it still does n't change the fact that up and down are reversed . This adds unncessary frustration and challenge in learning something that definitely feels backwards.There 's a toxic underwater stage in Donkey Kong Country 3 where the controls are reversed as a way to add challenge , and in my mind at least , having the controls reversed when trying to operate the airplane in this game definitely falls under the same category of unnecessary challenge.I hope you buy this game for your Sony Playstation and experience a fun time .	1
CRASH is my favorite videogame character.. i remember playing it when it first came out with my sister on the PS1 waaaaay back ... . This is SO fun . I love this game ! ! ! ! ! ! JUST BUY ITTTT	1
Once again , Crash Bandicoot takes a big step up to greatness ! `` Crash Bandicoot 3 : WARPED '' was fantastic ! It was even better than the second one . Better graphics , story , music , and gameplay.The enemies were fun just like in the first one and the new vehicles available were awesome , like the bi-planes , space fighter , Pura the Tiger , and the jet-ski . Also , it was n't as difficult to gather the Crystals and Gems as it was in the second part . The environments were better and the new powers that Crash Bandicoot acquires are totally awesome : the Super Belly-Flop , Speed Shoes , Death-Tornado Spin Attack , and the totally awesome Fruit Bazooka ! This is definitely one of the best of the games in the Crash Bandicoot Trilogy . You Crash fans MUST get this game !	1
I ca n't even begin to explain how much I love this game as well as the second Crash Bandicoot game ( I have n't played the first game yet ) because they are so much fun with lots and lots of humorous levels and disasters.Bandicoot is a marsupial on a muey dangerouso quest to collect 25 crystals and 25 relics in a quest to stop Dr. Neo Cortex and Aku Akus evil twin Uka Uka 's quest to take over the world.There are so many things that make this game so addictive , .1 . The music . It 's so hilarious2 . The complex levels3 . The graphics are so awesome4 . The way Crash dies ( I.E . falling off screen and his shoes fly up and fall back down , being sucked into a giant spinning vase and the lid closes on top of it ) By God to really even explain how great this game really is is difficult for me.Like Sonic the Hedgehog was for Sega , and Mario was for Nintendo , Crash is for the Playstation.In this day and age of excessively bloody and violent video games the Crash Bandicoot series is a great sigh of relief . I tend to enjoy sillier cartoonish games like this . I will never tire of this game .	1
Ca n't review this title now cuz I still have n't officially finished CRASH 's 1 & 2 , I bought it TO HAVE ! ! I 'm a classic game collector at heart , do n't know when I 'll start playing but i will eventually . Now that it 's in my library .	1
Crash Bandicoot : Warped = Orange , cool , creative , fuzzy , neat , great graphics , awesome design , introduction of secret levels for the series , power-ups , new bosses ( including a big boss ) , and a new playable character . These things are what make this a major improvement on the two previous games . Crash 1 was a breakthrough , Crash 2 opened up a new world , and this game completely blows it all away . This was how I got hooked on Crash Bandicoot . I played this and loved it . I recommend it .	1
Graphics : 10/10 - The best visuals of the series ! The colours shine fantastically and it all looks stunningly beautiful . The characters are clear and the game has backgrounds I could feast on.Sound : 9/10 - Great uses of evil voicing and fantastic sound editing detail makes Crash 3 's sound get a notch up.Value : 10/10 - You 'll be begging for more ! Overall : 10/10 - Fantastically detailed game that mixes genres and characters into a big story that erupts with fabulous enjoyment . In short : buy it .	1
All right for the guys that hate to read a lot about , real quick if you like 3d platform action adventure titles and maybe you like CB just one thing , GET IT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! .OK now to business , I have been in the world of video games since Atari 2600 and colecovision , so after more than 20 years of gaming I KNOW of what I am talking about , if I say its worth is worth it ! ! but the final word is always yours.Game-play : +++++This game has everything you need for hours of high quality of gaming experience , the art concept of the game goes over expectations of the hardware limitation of the PSO , The design of every single element in the game is very creative and unique , the developers invested time on the comedy of the game , which is a tradition on the original trilogy , as usual the controller its a wonder no need to struggle controlling the character and it vibrates as well , the powers , the moves and the style of the main character ( CB ) , its superb , every part of the game becomes fun , not repeatable pattern of enemies or levels , the game itself has a lot of extras for a replay , definitely an outstanding game ! ! ! ! ! .Difficulty : ! @ # $ % ( Platinum RELICS ) Curse , frustration , but with practice you might become a CB3W masterPlot : +++Well do not expect a twisted chrono trigger plot ! ! ! as always in crash games the lack of plot its compensated with a beautiful work in the software itself , basically crash goes trough a set of portals using N Cortex ( once again his back with an ally ) Own technology through time and space , the main thing is of course stop them ! ! .Graphics : *****This is the strongest part of the game no doubt , the game is programmed to utilize MOST of the potential of the PSO GPU , they managed to create excellent crystal effects ! ! ! , water ! ! ! , light sources and shiny surfaces like chrome and ice ! ! ! . one of the few games that deserve to be owned forever unopened ! ! , one the few great looking games for PSO.Overall : *****Perfect over all score ! ! . once again if you thing you can beat the game with one hand attached at your back and with folded eyes , try getting beyond 100 % and all the platinum relics , the real gamer and fans of the series did it ! ! look for it on you tube , so the difficulty is very acceptable ! ! . this is by far the best Crash Bandicoot game by far , since I personally thing that going trough naughty dog to travelers tales lost a bit of formula of this great franchise , but oh well see yas .	1
Well let & # 8217 ; s end the Crash Bandicoot trilogy on PlayStation with Crash Bandicoot 3 : Warped . This game was released in 1998 and was once again , developed by Naughty Dog , published by Sony Computer Entertainment and distributed by Universal Interactive Studios . It was originally a PlayStation exclusive but was later re-released as a PS One Classic on the PlayStation Store.The game & # 8217 ; s story takes place immediately after the events of the second game in which the ruins of the Cortex Vortex come crashing down to Earth and lands on a temple unleashing an evil entity known as Uka Uka who is Aku Aku & # 8217 ; s evil twin brother ; Aku Aku is the mask that helped Crash out in the first two games . Uka Uka joins with Doctor Neo Cortex and Doctor Nefarious Tropy as they plan to gather Crystals in their original places in time and use their energy to enslave the Earth.The game is once again a platformer with pretty much the same kind of controls as the second game . You can not only play as Crash but also as his sister Coco who was a supporting character in the second game . You travel back and forward in time to gather the 25 Crystals from the previous game in their original places in time before the enemy does ; but don & # 8217 ; t worry , the levels are completely different from each the second game . The game takes place in the Time-Twisting Machine which acts as the hub area of the game . The machine is split into five chambers with only the first chamber being available at the start . Each chamber has five buttons that open portals to different levels . The goal is the same as the second game ; obtain the crystal hidden in the area . Some crystals can be obtained in the middle of the level or by completing a certain task such as winning a race . The gems are also back and can only be obtained by destroying all the boxes , or completing a hidden level or task . Once you obtain the five crystals in a chamber , a sixth button will appear that warps you to a boss who will fight you in order to get the crystals back . By defeating the boss , the next chamber will become available to play . By defeating a boss you unlock a new power , there & # 8217 ; s the Super Slam which makes your body slam more powerful , the double jump , a tornado twister which lets you glide for a short period , a bazooka launcher which can be used to destroy crates or enemies or collect fruit and one ups and the running shoes which allow you to sprint.The newest main feature in the game is the & # 8220 ; Relics & # 8221 ; which can only be retrieved in a time trail mode for every level in the game . After you obtain a level & # 8217 ; s crystal , you can go back to the level and collect the yellow clock at the beginning to start a time trail . The goal is to reach the end as fast as you can , but there are some differences : There are yellow time boxes that when destroyed will stop the clock for a short period of time , there are no checkpoint boxes so if you die , you have to start the level from the beginning ; but there are plenty of Aku Aku masks to help you and that & # 8217 ; s pretty much it . It proves to be very challenging and getting the Platinum relics is insanely difficult and even I never managed to get all of them.This game proves to be the best one in the entire series and one of my favorite games overall , period . I would highly recommend getting this game off the PlayStation Store for $ 6 , this is a MUST PLAY . It really is one of the best.FINAL RATING : 10 out of 10	1
I 'm a big Crash fan and got this game the Christmas it came out . This game is incredible . Its easy enough for young kids ( about 6 or 7 ) or even really experienced gamers ( age depending . ) It has very good graphics for a PS1 game , and you can use the dual shock or regular controls in this . Unlike former Crash games , you use more devices than before , and in some levels are actually Coco ( Crash 's intelligent little sister . ) For example : Baby Tiger : Ridden by CocoBaby T-Rex : Ridden by CrashJet Ski Mobile : Ridden by CocoMotorcycle : Ridden by CrashFast-moving spaceship : Ridden by CocoBi-Plane ( with guns ) : Ridden by Crash and Coco ( level depending ) Underwater Jet Ski Mobile : Ridden by CrashAdditionaly , you get to fight other bosses , and defeating each boss earns you a special item . There are 5 in all. # 1 : Super Body Slam ( lets you break through protected crates ) # 2 : Double Jump ( allows you to jump over higher obstacles ) # 3 : Tornado Spin ( spins around wildly , helps you glide over bigpits ) # 4 : Fruit Bazooka ( a giant gun that can blast away your enemies ! ) # 5 : Speed Shoes ( gives you power to run , used to get certain relics ) The final thing : Crystals , Gems , Colored Gems , and RelicsCrystals : Right on the path for normal levels . They 're thin and pink . Touch them and you 've obtained them . Just beat the level to earn one after you pick them up . One per normal level.Gems : To get these , break all the boxes in the level . Sometimes you 'll have to have earned a color gem to get a gem . 1 to 2 per normal level.Colored Gems : 5 in all , one every 5 levels ( 25 normal levels , 5 secret levels . ) They serve as platforms to new areas in some levels . To get them , ride on a platform in some levels ( for the platform to appear , you have to not have died up to that platform . ) One in a level every 5 levels.Relics : A new addition . After you get the relic in the level , go back and get the relic by going as fast as you can through the level and getting a certain time . There are three types : Sapphire -- The basic . You can get this with no speed shoes.Gold -- -- -- More advanced . Most level you need speed shoes.Platinum -- Expert level ! EXTREMELY hard to aquire . Lots of practice needed ! That 's pretty much all that you need to know . All I can say is besides the tips , have fun !	1
I would say this is one of the the best ps1 games ever . I play it on my ps3.It is fun from riding a tiger to running around spinning bad guys . This is child friendly but also adults love it.It has good graphics , good gameplay , good ideas and lots of levels and replay value . Get this you wo n't miss out .	1
what is it a such a funny game than sonic you konw that fighting with cortex is bad idea because his boss have came uka uka the evil twin brother of aku aku . aku aku is good hearted mask man who can help crash for his mission . now you can counter boss in each level such in castle area you will encounter tiny tiger can i tell you how to reach boss finsh all levels bring pink cristals to get rid of aLL stages . but each places contains these things . and when you collect in each five warps cotians boss when you collect all of then than see six stage will apper kill each boss to unlock anthother warp room near your fisrt warp room . now can i tell you about boss in frist warp room cotians tiny tiger . then in second warp room cotains dinogldile boss . then in thrid warp room cotains dr.n.trophy . then in fourth warp contains n.gin . then in fiveth warp room contains dr.cortex and uka uka . this warp rooms where made by dr n.trophy master of times and it is not gene .	1
After passing the second and then the first , I was attempted to do this one . The graphics are much better than the previous two , but the story got very boring . The adventures , too , became very uninteresting . Regarding saving and hidden place this one is by far the simplest.The story here continues from where it ended in the last part , if you have won , that is . As oppose to aku-aku , we see the evil uka-uka who is the Big boss of Dr Cortex . And we see that Crash is forced to fight them ! Why ? Why , to save the world , of course ! In the previous 2 parts we had gems . Now , this was not enough for the overactive designers . They introduce trophies in this new part . For a trophy , you have to finish a level within an allotted time . This is not that difficult , but you can not achieve it in every levels . Some levels are extremely difficult to finish fast . I picked all the gems and all but on trophy , and imagine my frustration.If you are a crash fan you might like this one , but you can not help being disappointed .	1
This game takes months to get 100 % completion . The new feature in this is getting time rellicks ( by doing level fast ) and swimming . In Crash 1 you get Balders after you sometimes , in Crash 3 you get a dinosaur , I prefered being chased by a balder and when it squashed Crash it went into the screen but you do n't get it in this.BUY this if you want a platformer ( after Crash 1 and 2 ) .	1
The Crash games for playstion are very fun games , even better than the mario games . Out of the Crash seires I think this one is the best . There are alot of thing you can do and the bosses rock . The story line is the best in this game . It takes plase after Crash2 were Dr.Cortex ship falles down on a temple , wich releses a demon mask . The mask that pertected crash in the first two games stats talking and tells crash that the evil mask is his Brother and his plan to build a time machine to get crystles todestroy earth . The replay vaule is high and the gamplay is fun , you wo n't be able to put this game down for awile .	1
This game is great . You go through 5 different time portales . Each one has five different levels in it and at the end you face a boss . What you have to do is collect the colored gem and the crystal . Guess what . It 's not as easy as it sounds . This game pits you against tons of different enemies appropriate to the level . The only thing that takes a star away from this game is the fact that level ideas are repeated . For example there are two different water levels with not much difference . Oh ! one more thing . press up , up , down , down , left , right , left , right , square at the title page to get a playable demo of spyro the dragon . This is a great game for anyone who likes playstation	1
The original Crash game was very hard to beat . It was still classic . Then Crash 2 came out , with several hard levels and tough bosses . Then out came this one , Crash Warped . This is the cult classic of the series . I have beaten the entire game , and never once been disappointed because of too much or too little challenge . I even managed to get a 104 % file with the help of my brother and a twerp i know . There are two secret levels . They are Eggipus Rex and Hot Coco . To get to Eggipus Rex , you go into time trails in the Dino Might ! level . Then , board the yellow gem platform . Keep running until you find the second pterydactyl ( the triceratops will be already chasing you ) and let it take you away . To get into the Hot Coco level , simply crash into the road sign with an alien on it in the Road Crash level . This game is a classic and every PS One or PS2 owner needs to have it . Was this review helpful ? OF COURSE IT WAS !	1
Even though this game is so good , I think you should get Spyro 1 first.Spyro the Dragon gets you to a demo that leads to this.I know you 'll like it.If you have Spyro 1 then try the demo ! That is what I did .	1
Let me tell you all about this great game . I would n't want to give the story away , but let me tell you : The original two are no match for this great game ! This game has 30 new colorful and nice levels , and 2 hidden ones . Almost all of them have nice and pretty graphics . There are more features too . For one thing , there is the Time Trial mode , in which you go through the levels in a certain amount of time , and you will get relics . You can play as Coco , riding her adorable tiger Pura , a jetski , a blimp , and a couple more . Crash himself can do some more things , like a Super Belly Flop , a Double Jump , a Triple Spin , use Speed Shoes and use a Fruit Bazooka for long range attacks . Also , he can ride an airplane , a motorcycle , a baby T-Rex and more . Also , even dying is humorous . Now for the game 's one flaw : It is hard to be challenged . However , there are 3 types of relics . If you get all of the Sapphire Relics , you can get a really good ending . If you get all the Gold Relics , you get 105 % . But the Platinum Relics require a master to collect . So , if you like all that 's said , and even if you did n't , you will definitely love it .	1
this is a very good game , it is very challenging it has lots of levels and i managed to get 104 % but the ps2 crash is more challenging but the bad thing of the ps2 crash is that the loading takes more than 3 minutes .	1
I got this game when I was like..6 years old , and I still play it ( I 'm 14 now . ) I think all the Crash Bandicoots were a new cahnge for psx , and I hope that they continue to stick with psx .	1
This is a great game ! I played this all the time when I was younger and had to have it now as an adult ! Play it all the time !	1
This is a more than ok game.Not the best , but good.If you like the & quot ; Spyro & quot ; series , you 'll like this for sure.The gameplay , control , sound , etc . are all like the first 2.The only problem is it 's EASY.Really , really easy.The levels are about 5 minutes long each , and the total gameplay span is about 7 hours.But still , thats better than it being hard.It 's still pretty fun and stays true to the first 2.And Crash 's little sister premires in it . Here 's the review : Graphics:4/5Sound:5/5Music:3/5Fun:4/5Control : D-pad:3/5Analog:5/5Overall:4/5hould you buy it ? : Yep	1
This is the best platform game I 've played , and eliminates all down sides of its two prequels . You 're a bandicoot and jump on / spin baddies you encounter . This game is kind of like old Mario games , but has awesome graphics . They 've added a type of box to the prequel and give one move , such as bazooka or tornado death spin , for each boss . The game is easy to beat , but offers extras for breaking all the boxes or beating a level quickly . It 's extremely difficult to collect all of them . I recommend this game for everyone , especially people with a lot of free time on their hands .	1
Golden Eye 007 is still one of the best action titles ever created , along with the best licensed product ever released . The action is still superb and well-polished even since its release 10 years ago . The enemies are still smart , even with competitors like F.E.A.R . which have incredibly intelligent artificial intellignce . There are a couple of issues unfortunately ; some targeting problems and odd save layouts . Other than those , this game is still one of the best shooters ever made . The missions are excellent , the enemies are cool , the weapons are cool , and virtually everything else about this game is superb and well-executed . Too bad Nintendo handed the rights of James Bond to EA .	1
First , the single player is awesome . Then the multiplayer battle gets even better . But then when you add Game Shark it becomes the best game ever . One problem is that it is a bit unrealistic because there are up to 400 shots in a clip/magazine . Otherwise the game is good . Also if you like this game you will want Perfect Dark . If you like this game but wish it was more realistic get Rainbow Six .	1
I came upon this game in the late 90s/early 00s . Me and a couple of friends would play it religiously and I must say that although the characters are better and more original in this game , Perfect Dark ( if you have n't had a chance to play that ) is the superior shooter.They both are fun in their own right though . They were both made by Rare which did WONDERS for the N64 gracing us with the aforementioned games and also Diddy Kong Racing which I played for hours on end with friends also.Fun levels to play in and the music was pretty damn good too . Like I said , I liked the characters , Natalia being my absolute favorite and I kept coming back to this game.Even the single-player mode was fun . Just not nearly as fun as the multi-player mode.Fun : Single-Player : C+ Multi-player : B+Sound : B-Characters : B+Controls : A-Overall : B	1
with this game you play through each level in the movie . this is when James Bond was James Bond . you can choose from a whole list of players to choose from to play as . you can get any kind of weapon just about through the whole game . and you can even play with some friends on missions . if you have never played a n64 what are you waiting for . 5 out of 5. super fun .	1
I have to be honest : Normally , I 'm not into these first person shooter games . They 're just so clunky , most of the time you ca n't tell where you 're going , you do n't know if an enemy is behind you , ( Or at times even in front of you , if you get a weird camera angle ) and plus might I add that you ca n't see your character , which does not really , ( For me , most of the time ) give that whole imaginative feel that you ARE that character.Well , Goldeneye is an excellent and well made game.I do n't know why people complain about the graphics ... it 's actually kind of cool , and plus the enemies in this game are from head to toes so detailed that you think they 're real . The scientists in the facility level are well detailed , and most all the characters are animated incredibly.Besides , you take on the role of James Bond . James Bond ! The hero that defined action ! This game is not dull , and at times it is so scary when you are overswarmed by a bunch of enemies in one small room.The multiplayer mode , is , of course , wonderful . You can choose from power weapons , sniper rifels , Dostovals , Shotguns , PP7 's , proximity mines , hand grenades , laser guns , and basicly everything else that you can think of . It is an entertaining game , and it is well worth the money.The camera angles rock . you never get lost.So , why did n't I give this game Five stars ? Read below and find out.THE BADS OF THE GAMEThere are some major glitches . You can see your enemies literally walk through walls , not completely , but almost there.At times the doors , when I command it to open with the B button , it still wo n't open , even if I already DID get an access card for the door in the first place . The reason behind that is the fact that an enemy is probably trying to open the door as well , but how am I supposed to know that ? So , I stand back , the enemy comes in , and oh , guess what , it turns out that there is n't just one of them , there 's thirty , so they all shoot at me , and I die . You can easily die in this game just due to glitches , which makes it very difficult and frustrating.If you forget one thing on a mission , just one small thing which most of the time has nothing to do with the story , then you have to start the whole mission over again . You do n't just do the thing you forgot , either , you have to do all the things that you did do , as well as the things you did not.The game is predictible , due to the fact that it follows the movie , although when it does not follow the movie , ( Which it does a lot ) then it gets kind of dissapointing because what you expected did not happen.The puzzles can be frustrating . I 'm still trying to figure out how to get the bottling room on the facility level.The game is also very gory . I do n't know why they gave this game a TEEN rating instead of a mature ... it should of been rated mature.Now , for the GOODS of this game.GOODSUse an incredibly large arsenal of weaponry and more weaponry ... prepare to save the world , it 's gon na be a rough ride.It follows the movie really well , ( Most of the time , anyways ) And if you 're a big fan of james bond you will really enjoy this game . Even if you are n't you 'll still enjoy it.You play the role of james Bond , which is worth it within itself.This game is the greatest First person shooter game for the N64 . The controls are n't so difficult that you 'll get lost and forget which buttons to use while you 're losing , but they are simple and easy and at the same time fun . And even if you do n't like the controls , you can decide which buttons you want for which ones the controller screen.There 's nothing that you ca n't shoot or destroy.The cheats are FUNNY ! I mean , honestly , try the invisibility mode . You can shoot a near bye dashboard when a Gaurd is near , and that gaurd will start freaking out and look around to see who did that . This makes the game easier also , and the invincibility mode is good too , although I tried and realized that you ca n't have the invisibility mode and invincibility at the same time . You can also make the bad guys heads small and stuff , which is really funny to see.The way that the characters are animated are almost identicle to the characters in the movie ... they look exactly like the actors.At the end of every level , it tells you how many kills you did , how many limb shots , how many head shots , and how many body shots you had.The artificial intelligence with the badguys are n't all that challenging , but when there 's a whole crowd of them , watch out ! This game is excellent . Did I mention that it 's excellent ? Let me repeat it again : This game is excellent ! Excellent I tell you , excellent !	1
This is game was based on the movie and they hit it spot on ! Playing the levels are fun , but this is the perfect game to play if you are just sitting around with a few friends talkin about the old times .	1
With the Nintendo 64 beginning to slowly ... okay , quickly drop off the gaming radar , it 's time for gamers who bought the last of the Big N 's cartridge systems to see if their investment was a good one . Is there even a reason to keep this system around anymore ? Is there one game to give you an excuse to say to Playstation2 and X-Box and Gamecube owners , `` I know it 's an old system , but this game is the reason I still own it '' ? Yes , and that game is called `` Golden Eye 007 '' .It 's hard to believe that a game based off the best of the Pierce Brosnan `` Bond '' movies would become an undeniable classic . But that 's exactly what `` Golden Eye '' is . Many first-person shooters try to overwhelm gamers with unbelievable graphics while offering no depth in gameplay , while others try to create complex game engines with passable graphics and end up only frustrating players . Thankfully , `` Golden Eye '' is the diamond in the rough . It takes a remarkably simple control scheme and graphics that were good for its time and combines them in an unbeatable combination . Moving Bond , James Bond is as easy as breathing , and the shooting system is just as simple . Even with the horrible N64 controller , a player can learn how to play `` Golden Eye '' on the first or second try . And its gameplay is so addictive because of the stunning level designs and adequate AI . Of course , because of the N64 's difficult-to-program cartridge format , some things had to be sacrificed , like detailed textures and realistic AI responses to being shot . But the overall experience is enough to overlook such trivial matters.Graphically , `` Golden Eye 007 '' was a marvel to look at ... when it was first released . Nowadays , when compared to games like `` Metal Gear Solid 2 '' for the PS2 and `` Dead or Alive 3 '' for the X-Box , `` Golden Eye '' looks like a SNES game . Because cartridges are limited in space , textures can be bland , character models look blocky , and detail is kept to a passable minimum . But anyone who does n't care about graphics , as long as they are good enough and the gameplay is excellent , should n't have any trouble with `` Golden Eye '' .Soundwise , it 's not the biggest strength of the game , but it 's still good . Sounds like gunshots are remarkably well done - a player can tell what kind of gun he or an enemy is firing just by listening to it , at least to a certain extent . And voices , while limited to overdone grunts and questionable laughs , suit the game well . It would 've been nice to hear full voiceovers for important characters , but the limitations of the cartridge format does n't help this area much.All in all , `` Golden Eye '' is undoubtedly a classic of modern gaming . While the N64 is arguably one of the worst Nintendo consoles to be released ( alongside the horrendous Virtua Boy ) , it still had some incredible games that managed to sustain it until the Gamecube was announced . `` Golden Eye '' is not only the game that many FPS fans point to as their favorite game , but many non-FPS gamers also found it very enjoyable . While later great first-person shooters like the N64 's `` Perfect Dark '' and the recent X-Box million-seller `` Halo '' presented excellet FPS action with updated graphics to boot , `` Golden Eye '' will forever be remembered as the first-person shoot for the masses.If you need a reason to keep your N64 , this is it !	1
Goldeneye 007 is the best game for the Nintendo 64 . Its an amazing game , and its still fun to play today . There was a game called Perfect Dark that was similar to this and came out later , but this is the far better game . Tons of great guns and gadgets are here , and the gameplay is awesome . Its not the best first person shooter ever ( Halo for Xbox is ) , but its still one of the best . The graphics arent the best ever right now , but at the time , in 1997 or so , they were real great . The music is good . It has a mysterious sound to it for some reason . This game has some of the best levels in any game , and it controls great . Multiplayer in this game is some of the most addictive ever . At the time it had the best multiplayer around . It might not now , since there are games like Halo and Diablo II , but like I said , it was the best at the time . There arent really any negatives . All hail to the best game on N64 , and one of the best games ever .	1
`` Goldeneye 007 '' , at first glance , looks like yet another installment into the tired and outdated `` First-Person '' shooter game genre . The big suprise is that it is so much more than a standard shooter or a bog standard movie translation.In a word , `` Goldeneye '' is amazing . It takes full advantage of the 64 bit technology and delivers a smooth , fun , and challenging adventure . You assume the role of James Bond , the secret agent who needs no introduction . You run through various missions , which tie into the movie , and solve various problems and perform various tasks . What complicates things is the number of guards who are ready to kill you on sight . As expected , you have a number of weapons at your disposal , from the silenced pistol and machine gun , to the grenade launchers and high-powered explosives . The first-person perspective adds amazing realism to this game , with action and controls that are as smooth as James Bond 's charm.The graphics are phenominal , with smooth movements and amazing scenery . This game really makes you feel like you are living the adventures . The music is right out of a Bond movie , and adds a nice edge to the action . The controls , usually quite clunky on that horrible N64 controller , are easy to manage here . After a while it becomes like second nature.For parents considering this game for their children , they should be aware of the violence . Much of the game is spent killing people , and the realism is striking . It is up to you , but this is an excellent game that can be quite addictive .	1
This game has plenty of levels weapons and it has challenging gameplay with a pretty good multi-player ( but i wish u could face computers in the multi-player ) good graphics great play control and sound get this game if u do n't already have Perfect Dark	1
The game is overrated . Do n't get sucked into all the hype . It 's more nostalgic for the people who played it when it first came out . The graphics are honestly really bad and the controls make you feel like you 're drunk . I guess that 's where the fun is though , because honestly I really did like the game . I played through it and although the gameplay schematics were a bit ... strange , it was oddly addicting . Multiplayer is a lot of fun though when you have friends sitting down in the basement all hooked up . It can get pretty intense on split screen , seriously . 5 stars for the split screen ! 4 stars overall because the gameplay was repetitive and the graphics were vomit . They could have been better for the time period and the N64 was capable of handling better than this . Still , worth the buy . Get it .	1
In the year 1997 , Goldeneye was released for the Nintendo 64 by Rare , an unknown company and new 2nd party developer . Rare had already made several games for the NES and enters the Nintendo 64 market with this release based on the classic James Bond movie of the same title . You can ask anyone who had a Nintendo 64 if they ever played this game and why it was so popular . You 're guaranteed to hear 2 reasons in particular why this game is so revered.REASON # 1 : This game is a prime example of how a developer took its time to make this game . It was more than 2 years since the movie it was based on came out and Rare had access to everything concerning the movie from the original orchestral music , likeness of the main characters and locations to the bonus villains of other James Bond movies such as Oddjob and Mayday . They did n't rush this out the door like some developers do when they wanted their games released alongside the films it was based on and it always guaranteed to be a huge mistake . This game was a huge success and is still played by many video gamers.REASON # 2 : Nintendo had no idea that the multi-player section of this game would be just as popular to play in or more popular than the single player mode . Rare admitted in an interview after the game was released that they had no intentions of putting together a multi-player mode until later in its development stages . Though it may be limited by today 's standards , you had the basics : several stages based on the single player mode , all of the weapons were available , all of the main characters plus the enemy soldiers and classic Bond villains and several game modes such as free for all death match , team death match , you only live twice ( 2 lives ) etc . and you can select the weapons in group categories along with time limits per match . This added a lot of re-playability after you finished the single player mode.If you do n't have a Nintendo 64 , this game is reason enough to get it . This game helped Nintendo sell so many systems and it is a title I highly recommend getting if you can find it . It 's a great game to play by yourself and an absolute blast to play with 3 of your friends . Peace . : )	1
This game offers it all . Shooting action , adrenaline pumping duck and dodge fire fights , rescue missions , covert action , gadgets , evil villains , story and plot , and a lot of weapons . I reccomend this to any gaming fan . Buy this game right now ! You do n't know what you 're missing if you do n't . The game also offers an incredible ammount of replay value with dozens of cheats that can be activated by getting record times in levels and also two levels that can be activated by beatin gthe game on different levels of difficulty . All in all , a completely amazing game . Buy it . Do n't hesitate .	1
Even for a Gamecube and PS2 owner , for me this is the game that started it all . And while old , Goldeneye is still exhilerating . I was stupid enough to trade in my Goldeneye copy for a nwer but NOT better game . Do n't make the same mistake that I did , please ! It is hard to get your hands on a good copy of Goldeneye these days . Protect your Goldeneye games ! This game lives up perfectly to the movie , and for a 1997 game , the graphics and sound are excellent ! Sure , Nightfire 's fun , but it never revolutionized the gaming world like Goldeneye did . Goldeneye shoots TWINE and Agent Under Fire out of the sky . Nightfire ca n't even hold its ground against this solid and superb N64 title . In Goldeneye , you will encounter all of the characters and locations from the Goldeneye film , and the single player campaign holds its ground . But multiplayer is where the game really shines , and it is so much better than Timesplitters or Timesplitters 2 even . I have not played Goldeneye for over a year , but the music rings in my head and I have the levels memorized perfectly . Even if you worship your Perfect Dark copy , I believe that Goldeneye is better , and I have a strong debate on that . The bottom line is that Goldeneye is the BEST FPS EVER CREATED ! ! It boils down to this : if you own an N64 , please play your Goldeneye copy or if you do n't even know what this wonderful game is about , buy it now ! Hey , all X-Box owners , Goldeneye is even better than Halo ! There 's no debate on that . Buy the game that started it all ! My Rating:9.9 ! !	1

I have fond memories of this game , and still get together to play it with friends.Before GoldenEye , first person shooters were primarily PC affairs , played with a keyboard and mouse , and multiplayer required either internet or network capabilities , which , at the time , I did n't have . GoldenEye changed this . Just like Mario Kart , you could get four players hooked in . Except instead of bumping Bowser off a race track , you were running around and laying down the heat as Bond , or one of his allies/antagonists . There are plenty of modes , arenas , and weapons to choose from , ranging from deathmatch to 'flag tag ' . And once in a while you have to play with `` slappers only . `` In addition to the Multiplayer aspects , it has an excellent Single-Player mode . It 's mission objective based ( meaning that failure is entirely possible ) , and as difficulty increases , so do the number of objectives and conditions you have to fulfill.The music is also notable . Sure it 's entirely synhtesized/MIDI , but in those days , that was the state of the art . The music fits the scenes pretty well , mostly being varied riffs on the classic John Barry Bond theme , some being a little different.The game contains a nice variety of weapons and plenty of secrets to unlock ( by speedrunning levels while fulfilling all objectives ) .Whether you 've never played this classic or you 're looking back on the 'good old days ' , you should play it . Thisis Rare 's N64 Masterwork ( Perfect Dark is pretty sweet , too ) .	1
Alright this will most likely be the only time i will ever give a N64 game 5 stars , but for Goldeneye i eill make an exception . Ok Goldeneye was 64 's jump into the world of high tech video game systems , but unfortunately they could n't keep it up . This was a very solid 1st person shooter , excellent graphics , and not even repetitive secenary , what more could you ask for in a game ? The weapons were great , maybe a little exaggerated at times , but over all good . Long levels and lots of them made this game excel in the lasting appeal category . Sound was good , but not having the cd quality sound os a PS or a DC hirt it a little . Unfortunately Goldeneye got a little smack in the face when everybody started comparing it to the flopped Perfect Dark game . But overall a great game and even though i am a die hard Playstation fan i still have a place in my heart for Goldeneye .	1
When I purchased this game the graphics were obviously amazing with the new nintendo 64 . I used to play this hours on end , doing the single player missions over and over and also having some friends over to play multiplayer . After the playstation 2 came out I pushed the nintendo 64 over for a few weeks but I found my self slowly returning to some goldeneye along with a few other great nintendo 64 games.Now that I have a 360 I rarely play goldeneye anymore . But with the recent purchase of a n64 , i have again , found myself playing goldeneye with all the wonderful , fun cheats that it offers . This game changed the way we play games , totally . It is still one of the best games I own , right next to the newest xbox 360 games .	1
This is a cool game . You complete every mission on 00 agent and you unlock the 007 difficulty level . You do n't need a memory pak or card to play this game .	1
i played this game when i was about 15 , and i 'm now 24 and still love it to the death ( literally ) . I have a blast shooting other things other than just people and watching bullet holes go into the items and how it looks so freaking real . I also have always loved how you can choose many different people in 2 player mode , such as 007 to scientist . The golden gun is the coolest because it only takes on shot to kill , but if you like a really smashing good time , you can always punch or cut your way out . A must have game for the 64 : - )	1
this ganme was very entertaining i really enjoyed it i 'm not to fond of these types of games but goldeneye was awesome .	1
I LOVE THIS GAME . It is so funny and a bit hard to beat . The hardest level is in the temple where a shuttle is launching and you have to collect data , kill Jaws , get launch tape and launch the shuttle . My favorite level is the Facility Level . That level is so funny and you can shoot the scientists , but it will fail the mission if they were killed . My cousin and I love to blow up the enemies and scientists . My favorite is shooting the scientists and enemies in their butts and they would jump up and down rubbing their butts and then they will fight back and the scientists will threw grenades at you . The controls are easy and this game is better and funnier than the movie . BUY THIS GAME .	1
Awesome controls , greta levels , killer music , loads of cool guns and awesome James Bond . The perfect shooter ! Played this one a lot .	1
I still get this game out . Everything is ideal , if they ca n't recreate this it will be a shame . N64 ruled in the old days , this and Mario were so amazingly fun , it was constant , you could play for months on end and still love it to death while finding something entirely new and exciting .	1
This game is a keeper to have and I would n't mind playing another James Bond game , which I 'm getting From Russia with Love . And that means there will be more fights to the end . I just keep playing this game over again .	1
Though Wolfenstein 3-D and the Doom franchise had come and gone long before its time , Goldeneye for the Nintendo 64 grabbed the First Person Shooter genre and ran with it for what seemed like miles and miles . Forget a touchdown , this game ran the ball for fifteen hundred yards , with three interceptions and a dozen field goals . Nothing on a home console was even close to its league . And even today , in the afterglow of behemoths like Halo , Metroid Prime and a limitless roster of PC shooters , the game holds up surprisingly well considering its limitations.It 's difficult to call any game `` perfect . '' No matter how original , how exciting , how breathtaking it may look , sound , play or feel , there remain a couple frustratingly overlooked areas , and Goldeneye is no exception . Most notably poor are the one or two levels which feature a limitless stockpile of enemy soldiers . No lie , I 've memorized the layout of a base from start to finish , known there 's nowhere these soldiers could be coming from , and watched as dozens and dozens miraculously appear from thin air to resume their fallen brothers ' attack . It makes strategy an impossibility and frustrates the player to their wits ' end . In addition , there 's the small matter of dead or dying enemy soldiers who stand in the way . Every once in a while , an armed adversary will take a head shot and then stand , blankly staring , for several moments before slowly dropping to the floor . This would n't be such a bad thing if the other soldiers ' bullets could n't pass right through him . So you 'll often find yourself firing into the chest of a dead man , a futile attempt to get at the soldiers behind him , all the while taking fire from those still breathing on the other side of his body . Despite my small misgivings however , 99 % of this game plays flawlessly . The progression of difficulty is astounding , moving from the relatively easy early levels to a series of seemingly impassible stages near the cart 's conclusion . And it 's all done while walking that razor 's edge between being excessively cheap and being overly giving . The player realises these missions are possible , even as he 's watching Bond die for the twelfth time in as many minutes.Add to all that three difficulty levels , cheats that must be unlocked with speed , precision and overall know-how , hidden stages and hidden characters . Not only do you have a legendary FPS , you 've also found nearly limitless replay value . Goldeneye is more than just a very good game , it 's the stuff legends are made of . It 's a game you 'll want to play with your grandkids years from now.Hands down , the most attractive part about Bond 's N64 debut , even today , is its controls . The Nintendo 64 controller was seemingly created exclusively for use with 007 's repertoire , as every button is in precisely the right place for its function . It truly is the kind of thing that takes five minutes to learn and a lifetime to master . The center grip of the N64 controller seems to BECOME the handle of a silenced PP7 , Bond 's revolver of choice . The `` Z '' button is a perfect trigger , and if you 've purchased a Rumble Pack you can even feel the weapon kick back when you fire . Strafing is done effortlessly with the right hand , as is crouching and adjusting the zoom of a sniper rifle . No control system has ever felt so immersive , so right . After the first level , you hardly recognize the controller is there , it 's already become such an extension of your own body . I ca n't sing any higher a praise than that.If you 've seen the feature film of the same name , you 'll notice some eerie similarities . Everything , from the writing on a wall in the city to the placement of the soldiers deep within a Russian bunker is precisely as it was seen on the silver screen . It 's honestly unsettling , how well the level designers did their jobs . Ever wondered what was behind that last bathroom stall in the film ? You 'll get your chance to find the answer on the N64 . It 's an experience I ca n't really put into words , something I 'd never seen before and have n't seen since . It 's a level of perfectionism that has yet to be matched in a video game adaption.Finally , there 's the multiplayer aspect of 007 . While the single-player mode is challenging , unique and groundbreaking , multiplayer is absolutely unreal . I had the good fortune of living in a large college dorm complex at the time this game was first released , and thus experienced more multiplayer Bond than I 'd wish on anyone . There were literally lines leading into my room , just for the chance to grab one of our four controllers and get into the action . It was an addictive community event , whenever that little red light on the front of our N64 lit up . Truly something special . With multiple modes of play , a handful of playable levels , some hidden surprises and dozens of options , you were guaranteed to never play the same match twice , and it did n't take much for the lighthearted action to become a cold-hearted war . In a time and place where four player deathmatches are a no-brainer , it 's hard to imagine a game that pioneered the field . Goldeneye blazed that path , and did so in style . It cleared out the weeds , flattened the hills , and paved the roads that Halo drives its way across today . Truly , the game was revolutionary and it still plays as such.In short , Goldeneye is almost reason alone to own a Nintendo 64 , even today . There 's a charm about it that ca n't be described , a realism and authenticity that goes beyond the aging graphics and occasionally slow gameplay . It 's got the look and feel of a legend , and that 's exactly the word I 'd use to describe it . While there are certainly flaws , this is a game you 'll kick yourself for never owning in a few years , when it becomes increasingly difficult to track down .	1
GoldenEye became the steeple for how the Bond series was going to be and I 'm glad that it was because for me , I could never get tired of this game because of it 's awesome challenges , graphics , gameplay and of course the gore factor ( very bloody game . Maybe a no for younger gamers , but for those of us older gamers , a definite ) .Level after level , this game played almost to a T like the movie and you got to use all of Bond 's weapons from his magnum to a bazooka , to grenades and plastic explosives and of course , the one hit kill Golden Gun.This also had the perfect multi player vs mode in the history of the 64 system . Where else could you blow up 3 of your friends with a bazooka at the same time ( if you were lucky enough to stumble upon them shooting it out with each other ) .GoldenEye has never left my 64 rotation and again , I still love to play the multi player when my friends come over . I will again stress to those of us who are parents ( like myself ) that you should maybe think otherwise if you have some young gamers because it is very violent and very bloody . For those of you without that restriction , go wild and get this game . You wo n't be disappointed .	1
GoldenEye 007 was simply the greatest game ever made . No if , ands or buts . This game stood out from the rest giving itself the title of the almighty master of the game world.My Uncle Steve was the first person to tell me about the game in 1997 and told me I had to get Goldeneye and told me Its the best game he ever played and he only had a Playstaion at the time . I played this game when it first game out I was 11 years old and I 'm now 24 and still love it to the death.GoldenEye set the standards for every FPS that has followed .	1
Ever since I purshased GOLDENEYE 007 on the old N64 , I became highly addicted to it , like many other gamers around the world . I also have to thank this game as well , because it made me a hardcore James Bond fan.This is the best first-person shooting game ever ! Although dated , the detail of this game is amazing . There 's over 14 levels of shooting ! My favorite missions are the first level , the Silo mission , the Train mission , and the very last level.Highly recommended game ; it fuels the senses ! If you like James Bond , or any type of video game , get it ! Mostly all of you have .	1
I got this game when it first came out which was a couple years ago , but I 'm just now writing the review , strange is n't it ? This game is what makes having an N64 so great ! The graphics are just sweet . The story pretty much follows the movie , and alters a little things to make it more enjoyable for us gamers . This game is very easy to control . That 's one of the best things about it . The controls are placed if logical places , and it 's better than the Turok controls . The best part of this game is the multiplayer . It 's what made the game so famous . Killing your friends has never been this much fun . I 'll never get tired of one of my friends walking in a hallway , unsuspecting that a proximity mine is waiting there to take his digital life . The best multiplayer level has got to be the facility . But I 'll let you , the buyer , decide for yourself . Another game I recommend , and that 's probebly better is Perfect Dark .	1
I am a major player of 007 games . I have played nearly every single one , but I have to say , GoldenEye is one of the best that there is , even years and platforms later . Even though I have a GameCube with all of the other 007 games , I still to this day find myself returning to play a round of Goldeneye.GoldenEye has a great plotline ( in my opinion , even better than the movie ) and long missions , which allow a lot of replay value . The graphics are a bit blurry , but that is to be expected in an N64 FPS.Overall , I love this game , and would reccomend it to any 007 fan .	1
One of the games that made n64 so great , had graphics for the time , multiplayer all around fun and in my opinion one of the best games of it 's time	1
GoldenEye 007 is one of the best game 's for the , Nintendo 64 . When , you hear pepole say the game is Great , There not kiddin ' . I 've had This game for a while , And I 'm still coming back to it . It 's an 11/10 Replay value . I 'd give GoldenEye 007 more Star 's if I could . If , you want a game that you can come back to , Year 's later , And a GREAT game for alot of pepole , Then Get GoldenEye 007 .	1
Another Rareware CLASSIC ! The game that defines 1st person shooter ! ! Like the title says , Rare did it Best . I love the PC shooters like Doom , Quake & Duke Nukem . But 007 did it 1000 % ! The first of it 's kind ... perfect 3-d graphics & 360 control . And the first game to do stealth right . You can sneak through levels stealth with your silenced pistol , or go all out nuts with the AK . This model of game would go on to influence ALL future fps . PS3 & xbox fanboys take notice ! If rare had n't come up with this formula , Modern Warfare & Halo would n't exist as they are !	1
Goldeneye has to be one of the best multiplayer games ever . I still play this game against friends even though i have a ps2 now . The graphics are still ok to look at , even though i have seen far better on dc and ps2 . It has excellant replay value and is very challenging to defeat on all difficulty settings . Pick this up if you want the best fps on n64 .	1
... for it 's timeGoing back and replaying this game is weird and fun . it 's fun to see how bad the graphics were , and how you did n't see it that way back in the day.considering how easy it is to buy old games , this is a must buy !	1
There were a few stickers on the cartridge , but it 's alright because the game worked fine and it 's such a fun game when you 're on multiplayer mode .	1
I remember playing multiplayer tournaments on this when I was younger and still play against my son when I can .	1
Good graphocs , multiplayer mayhem , secret levels of which the first is kind of like a part of the movie & quot ; Moonraker & quot ; ( earn this level by beating the game on secret agent ) and the second of which is where you have to beat Baron Sameidei with the Golden Gun ( earn this level by beating the game on OOagent ) . The game is not overly gory . If you shoot someone a red patch appears on there clothes , but it is hard to see on most of the 3d characters . With twenty levels in all and ten or so multiplayer areanas it is no wonder this game was voted game of the year in & quot ; Nintendo Power & quot ; magazine . The music is excellent and can really get you excited and it can also get you scared . The AI is pretty dumb on the agent setting , it develops about a fifty percent intelligence upgrade on secret agent setting , and on OOagent you had better find some cover ! The game can take a while to beat if you want to get all the secret levels and secret codes for the game by beating the main game missions in a certain time with all of the objectives met . Have and watch out !	1
Golden Eye on the Nintendo 64 needs no introduction it redefined the FPS genere it had great controlls for it 's day stuck as close as it could with the movie it was a major killer app for the 64 around 97-98 . The music was good the graphics were decent enough there dated now but this game was & still is the $ **t. Golden Eye never has failed on any level I still play it from time to time & the multiplayer back in the summer of 98 me my friends or my brother or his friends or my cousin we all played the multiplayer to death . Should you get this game well it 's been out since the late 90 's & & if you never played it your missing out it warrants a purchase of a N 64 for this game alone . Golden Eye for the 64 is as good if not better than movie .	1
I thought that I 'd review some James Bond 007 video games the games that I own . You know it 's going to be The 50th Anniversary this year which I might see Skyfall but I 'm here to review the best 007 game by far Golden Eye on The Nintendo 64 which was a game that was only exclusive to The N64 meaning back in 97 it was like hey you need to go out & buy a Nintendo 64 . I remember playing this game a lot in 1998 it 's an amazing game all around of course the multiplayer is what stands out I played it a lot with my brother , my friends & cousin a lot . The single player mode is well done the game play is great & the weapon selection is the best of all The 007 games . For what it is it does a good job of following the movie Golden Eye going through the 1st 3 levels it deals with the beginning of the movie . Where you think 006 Alec Treyvelyn was kill & where Bond escapes in the plane . There is a level you saw in the movie Servenya that you go to . You have to go there twice the 2nd time is where you meet Natalya who in the movie you meet in the helicopter explosion . Of course you meet Janus at The Statue Park who turns out to be Treyvelyn . You get to use a tank just like in the movie you get to go through the train depot which is n't in the movie the train level is pretty good & there are lines that Alec Treyvelyn says in the movie on this level . The last 4 levels is pretty much the movie towards the end . This game is 1 of the best 1st person shooters out there it changed the genre . If you never played Golden Eye on The N64 I ca n't reccommend it enough & I 'm not talking about the new 1 which I have yet to play .	1
No doubt , the best Nentendo game ever created up till this day . This game is better than all the Nentendo games for all it 's systems . It has the best multi player game ever for any system , and a A- single player game . The only thing about the multiplayer game is that it could use a bit more weapons . And the single player game is up there with Metal Gear Solid ( the original ) . It 's game has lots of levels , and is very challenging , but in a good way . It 's cheat options are really hard to get , but once you do , it makes the game even more awsome . So overall , you only need one word to describe this game : spectacular .	1
The level 's are great and there is a lot to do to save the world in the nick of time before some bad happen 's . YOU as bond . As you go into the game they are other bad guy 's are trying to kill you as you try to save the world . HEY , buy this game , you will have a time of you life and trying to stay alive . Hey , it true it is a good game to play by yourself or two people , Hey go buy the game and find out what I'am talking about OK . I play it over TEN time because it GREAT to get into . By the away they are FOUR bad guy 's are after you so run , run , RUN for your life well , just in the game , are you lucky . Do n't spoil yourself over this game I have . KEEP YOUR COOL IN THE GAME SO GOOD LUCKY . PS , Your going to need it . There are easy levels and hard levels and there are very hard level 's . Get ready for a big adventure to save the world . There are Characters in the game just like the movie is that cool or what ? ?	1
... BR > This game , more than any other for the Nintendo 64 , is what will come to mind when most ppl think of the N64 . Mainly because , this was one of the first shooter games to require the gamer to use his brain to solve puzzles and get thru the nasty surprises the game will throw at you . Not following the bloodlust of previous first shooter games like Doom , Heretic , Turok , etc . this game is in a class of its own . It gives you objectives to complete however , unlike Perfect Dark it adds to the challenge by giving you deadly surprises that are NOT mentioned in the mission breifing , these will make at least restart a few levels over and over until you figure it out for yourself . Its a much better game than any other First shooter Ive played since it stresses Stealthy behavior , and intelligence on the part of the player to succeed.Granted it does not have the extras in the Multiplayer section that Perfect Dark has but it has an element of challenge that Perfect Dark will never have .	1
Even though this game was released over ten years ago , I still have fond memories of it . This game really pushed the capabilities of the Nintendo 64 with its 3D ( if somewhat still pixelated ) surroundings . There were enough options and variety to make the game interesting - you could go through the levels in Easy , Normal , and Hard mode , and beating the levels in certain difficulty levels within certain time limits would unlock cheats . Some of the cheats were silly , like Donkey Kong mode , but others were cooler , like Invisible or Infinite Ammo mode.Playing the levels in Easy mode was a great way to prep/'study ' for Normal and Hard modes ( exploring the surroundings , knowing where to go , so you could complete the extra requirements that came with the difficult mode ) The save mode allowed one to explore the levels at their leisure - sometimes I played a level I already beat just for fun and exploration , ignoring the time . Molti-player mode was also a lot of fun.The graphics in this game were not as refined as the Wii and PS3 because Nintendo 64 was a groundbreaking console when it came out and the 3D graphics ability was not quite fully mastered yet , so for those of you used to the smoother graphics of today 's current consoles , you might notice a bit of clunkiness , and the characters had blocky hands and limbs , and their faces looked painted on their heads . But the 3D was well-done in terms of set-up and surroundings as far as movement and exploration of the world went , so two thumbs up . Even now , I prefer this game to many newer ones because the plotline and play was very good . A- for a wonderful overall game .	1
This is one of my favorite FPS 's of all time . It stands right alongside Halo , and Battlefield 1942 . The single player missions are done wonderfully , the enviroments are great , and the multiplayer is the best I have ever played.BUY THIS !	1
This is the one game that I would play day in and day out , for more than a year . The one game where I discovered something new almost every time I played . It was the one game which brought me and my friends together religiously at least 3 or 4 times a week . Somehow it just would n't die , no matter how hard we tried.At first , it just seemed so standard and bland . Playing muliplayer for the first time , I had problems finding guns and felt confused and bored running through the Temple level . soon , somehow , something clicked , and me and my friends ended up playing it for about 4 hours straight . Towards the end of that introductory marathon Goldeneye session , we took our first stride out of the standard Deathmatch restriction- increasing my character 's health to its highest limit and my friends fighting against me . Thus we coined the & quot ; God & quot ; mode , and we played this variant to death in the coming months.It did n't end there . We had fests where we would do nothing but attack each other with punches . We bought a bunch of video cable and conected three televisions together to form a sort of splitscreen , LAN-type mode , covering up other player 's screens so we would n't know where the other players were . We playedthe Team mode constantly , refining our knowledge of the levels and our marksmanship . Fed up with auto-aiming , we turned it off and further honed our skills . I began to be able to play the Complex level in my sleep . Proximity mines soon became an addiction . We pushed the game to its limits , learning that we could move the ammo boxes , shields , and guns around by shooting them , thus reworking their positions and creating large stockpiles in team games . We began to use Gameshark to unlock multiplayer maps that were n't intended for the final version , as well as increasing the limits on two and three player maps to four players . We discovered a code that turned one player invisible , and proceeded to do hunter-hunted scenarios over splitscreen.Basically , it was the first game to really show limitless possibilities . It was a revolution for first-person shooters , and so many have overlooked this fact . It was the first to have targeting of individual body parts , over 20 weapons to choose from , realistic glass , shooting out of lights , and bullet holes , and for its time fairly revolutionary AI . All in all , it was an experience that defined video games for me , and few if any have matched it with a similar addictive experience .	1
Goldeneye 007 on the now obsolete Ninetndo 64 is still to this day my favourite game of all time . Before the Nintendo 64 arrived i was a massive Sega fan , nothing anyone said could put me off my Sega obsession . And then i played Mario 64 and everything changed . I went out and swapped my Sega Saturn and all it 's games for a brand new Nintendo 64 and a second hand copy of Mario 64 and i never looked back . Then allmost a year later Goldeneye 007 arrived and introduced me to a whole new genre . You see before Goldeneye , i had never played a first person shooter so it was all new to me . I also happened to be a huge James Bond fan at the time so i was quite excited about playing this for the first time , and i was not dissapointed . Everything about this game just worked so well , it had the right feel a bond game should have . It was also one of the most addictive multi-player games ever . Me and me mates would spend hours playing this game . The weapons are some of the best ever in a first person shotter . The snipper riffle in particular was awsome to use and the tank levels were so much fun . Since Goldeneye there been some trully amazing shooters including the brilliant Half-Life , but for some reason i have yet to play a game that has that same magic as Rare 's wonderful game . If you have n't played this yet then you do n't know what you 're missing .	1
Very good FPS game , although multiplayer mode does lag . Highly recommend for your N64 collection . This one is a classic .	1
Lord , It has been too darn long since I last played this master piece.The single player mode is too much fun . But , the 99 % of the credit goes to the multi game mode.Great selection of weapons , nice variety of levels , Huge list of characters to choose from ( from the original bond movies ) , fun options while playing ( Bobble head characters , paint ball shooting marks ) .I am telling you the game was the center of attention with friends . Large gatherings , challenges , playing till the break of dawn . I will give the game credit from keeping us off the streets = ) .I do n't know if I can find this game , but boy if you can ! Find three friends and Play it without mercy.All the best , Nawaf	1
Golden eye , games that are coming out now owe their controls to golden eye . Based on the movie , the game is truly hard hiting gameplay action that is super fun . This game is a very great shooting game . One of the best shooting game of all time , golden eye has a great story , and goes along with the new 007 games that are coming out . Redifine the origin by playing this game if you have n't . Sure the graphics are n't that great but dude , its nitendo 64 . They should remake this game and other classic 64 games for nitendo gamecube . If you still play 64 ( god have mercy ) you will also love perfect dark.If your buying this game , for some reason you should add perfect dark . Same game play action , but for some reason I love & quot ; Perfect Dark & quot ; better . But thats me ... ..	1
I loved this game , and playing it now after all these years it 's still awesome . Multiplayer on a split screen is still fun .	1
The multiplayer is amazing but most reviews already cover that . I still have yet to beat the last level `` Cradle '' and the 2 bonus missions on the hardest difficulty after 12 years , and yet I am addicted to trying over and over . I finished the Campaign twice on the 1st 2 difficulties . Each difficulty higher , the more parts of the level you explore , and the more crazy scenarios you will experience , places and scenarios that you did not experience in the easier difficulties.. Many missions you can go about using stealth or guns blazing . It is always fun trying to beat facility or Bunker # 1 with just a silenced pp7 without alerting anyone . Nothing is more satisfying than shooting 2 gaurds to death with a silenced ppk before they can hit the alarm . In some levels if you are feeling arrogant , you can hit the alarm yourself and take on hundreds of enemies and go rambo . There is so much about this game I could go on for days about how amazing this game is . No modern AAA FPS has surpassed Goldeneye on N64 campaign to this day . The remakes have been complete crap , despite the amazing COD engine . If you own a N64 and love perfect dark or other great FPS adventures you will love this .	1
Yeah this is one of the classics that blew away everyone ( N64 MAGAZINES got better because of it ! ! ! ) and bonded friends and family for years on end . There was no other game like it . Empire magazine started writing better games reviews because of it . This was a mental good multiplayer in 1997 . We all played this side by side for years . I ca n't say I have played anything quite like it since . Golden Eye N64 . Yeah , those where the days ! ! ! I remember this left Playstation 1 owners in awe .	1
I purchased this game after a nostalgia case I had ( lol ) and it worked just fine . I would buy another if this one failed .	1
My N64 , it acts like a rock sitting right there under my tv . I bought a total of 8 count em 8 games on this pathetic system ( I have what about 60 for my computer ) . But this game made me believe that a good shooter could be made on consoles ( although very few of the ports from pc to consoles are , usually the original games for the consoles are good . ) Of those 8 games I have , this one is worth about 10 . The makers of this game are geniuses and have spread that on to other games like the timesplitters series ( if there is any game that will make me buy a gamecube , besides metroid prime , it IS timesplitters 2 . It is a master peace that will be lived on in my memories and it will remain stuck in my damn cartrage slot of my forgotten n64 , or it would be forgotten , if not for this game	1
This game was okay - it could 've been better . I like the story , it 's way different than it is in the movie - it 's more fun . But like I said before , Perfect Dark 64 is the new Bond . The main story is fun and so is the multiplayer combat . There 's a crap load of Bond characters to unlock and levels too . But I 'm not a Bond fan , in fact , I hate Bond ! But this game is fun .	1
The movie `` Goldeneye '' was a box-office hit and now it comes to nintendo . Every wonder how James Bond found Natalia , how Xenia died , or how Bond killed Trevalyn . Now you get to do it yourself . You travel to Siberia to recover blueprints , go on a battleship to save hostages , launch a space shuttle , and shoot all the bad guys you want with over 30 weapons from Gernades , lasers , all handguns , machine guns and rocket and nuclear bombs . Try out the game to see what you would do if you were Bond . Here 's your chance to be 007 .	1
The names Bond , James Bond . Those five words mark the saying of probably on of the most famous fictional spy of all time . And , finally he came to the Nintendo 64 . This game is by far the best game for any console . It kicks Resident Evil 's butt all the way back to campcom 's facility to teach them not to make such stupid looking games .	1
Great game , but Perfect Dark is WAY better . If you really like Bond or you can find this game cheap somewhere you might want to pick it up , but if you 're just looking for a good first person shooter or multiplayer game skip it and get Perfect Dark instead .	1
Goldeneye set the standards for every FPS that has followed . It is the best of the best . The levels are action packed and extremely memorable . I can do the levels in my head I 've played them so many times . The graphics are dull now , but back in the day these visuals were top notch . The music involves some of the best techno I 've ever heard . The game is also surprisingly difficult . I took me ten years to beat all the difficulty levels . The multiplayer is ahead of it 's time with four player large arena style deathmatches . This game should be missed by no one , pick up a copy today and first hand see the best.Presentation- This game captures what it is to be James Bond . There are a great deal of weapons , cool menus , and music that still rocks to this day . All around a great feeling game the blood rolling down the screen after you die is epic . 5/5Story- The game follows the story of Goldeneye pretty closely , and there are two bonus levels that follow other Bond movies . Including one of the hardest levels of all time the Aztec based on the movie Moonraker . 5/5Graphics- This game looked amazing for it 's day , now it may be unimpressing but remember what the world of N64 looked liked . 5/5/Game play- This is the part that could be helped by a remake . The N64 controller only has one joystick . This is awkward sometimes , but the use of the c-pad to strafe helps . Nintendo please remake this amazing gem . 4.5/5Sound- Some of the best music in a video game ever made . Catchy music that I even have on my Ipod to this day . 5/5Lasting Appeal- I still play this game regularly when the current generation games anger me . I can play levels in my head , need I say more . This game will never be forgotten or equaled . 5/5Rating 4.9/5	1
This game was awesome when I was little and owned my original N64 , and it 's still awesome to this day . You just ca n't outdo a good thing , and this game proves it .	1
I had to use a Gameshark to get the extra levels on this game . It 's tough . It shows you just how hard it would be to be a secret agent.There are two features about this game that I really like . The first is what I 'd like to call maim-ability . If you shoot someone in the leg , they 'll hold onto their leg , same with the arm , the head , and even the groin . Before this game , the most you could hope for was that characters would bleed when they were shot and fall down when they 'd die.Still maim-ability does n't mean that when you shoot them in the leg they wo n't be able to run again . They 'll limp for a few seconds and then be as good as new , except take a lot less shots to kill.Some of the tougher characters take a lot of hits before they 're even to the point of getting to maim-ability . You have to shoot the boss of the game 10 times in the head before he even shows signs of weakening.The second thing I like about this game is the spy feel of it . You go on missions , and you work with gadgets ( although some are indeed lame ) . But the cool thing is , on some missions , you 've got to be really quiet and sneaky . You sneak down halls and pick off unsuspecting guards one by one with well-aimed shots . Of course , if you get bored of that , you can always make a lot of noise , have a bunch of guards come after you , and blow everyone away.This game is pretty realistic . There may be better games now , but during its time , this game was cutting-edge stuff . It 's worth remembering , even though it was hard as heck . I usually just like playing the easy levels and maiming bad guys quietly .	1
Golden Eye is widely considered one of the best FPS ever made . It is a great solid game , and I recommend this game to everybody .	1
Brings back memories of days long gone by . As i 've turned from kid to teen , from teen to young adult and some day to old man , the nostalgia and memory of my childhood in the '90s becomes ever more appealing to me . Back in the days of summer vacations , weekends off , few worries and fewer obligations and responsibilities .	1
This game may not have a lot of flashy features like sound , or simulant multiplayer , but who cares ? I bought this game in 1998 and I still play it . I recommend it to anyone who likes first-person-shooters , or a James Bond fan .	1
GoldenEye 007 is not only the best movie tie-in game of all time , but it is perhaps the most influential first-person shooter ever to hit the gaming-console market . If you are n't aware of the plot of this game that 's not a problem , because essential it is the same as the popular James Bond movie , GoldenEye , which was released in 1995- two years prior to this game 's release.This is a game that is filled with techniques and styles that would be mimicked in many future games to come , and it gives the player a wide variety of objectives , and difficult challenges . The A.I . is smart ( especially on higher difficulty settings ) and the environments are complex enough to provide entertainment , as well as difficulty to any gamer.The introduction of logical hit-points on your enemies is a great feature . Even bosses in this game can be taken down with a well-aimed shot to the head . It is this type of realism that really makes you feel like your James Bond and that you can sneak in , sneak out , covertly taking out henchmen as you go , or springing alarms and having to go through massive shootouts . Because of this there are many ways to beat the game , and limitless possibilities for how you accomplish your tasks . AKA : You can take easy ways or hard ways of beating levels ... and if you do n't have a strategy guide you 'll have to find out those paths by yourself ( which , I might add , is incredibly fun if you want to waste a day away ) .This is one of those games that the more you play it the more you 're able to value its contributions to the gaming industry . Each time I play it I notice aspects that have been replicated in many following FPS games . So if you have a Nintendo 64 go ahead and dust that sucker and order a used copy of GoldenEye 007 , because trust me , as a Bond fan , and a casual gamer I can say that this game is highly recommended for all those who want to step into the shoes of James Bond , or just have an awesome , intense gaming experience . ( Also make sure to look out for its sister game , Perfect Dark , which is also on the N64 , following the same controls , and very similar weapon uses . )	1
Hands-down the best N64 game . Goldeneye is very similar to the movie , like the Siberian dam mission , the satellite control facility , etc.. The graphics are the best I 've seen for the N64 , except for Zelda 64 ( the first one ) . The auto-aim feature and 4-person multiplayer make the game perfect for the common area of a dorm room .	1
Goldeneye lookes like just another shootem up game , but it is more than that . Goldeneye takes James Bond to the next level.Pros : graphics are great4 player is funlots of cheats to make the game even betteralot of characters to choose fromCons : a little to easy to beatno voices during game playnot alot of multiplayer levelsIn the end Goldeneye is a great game and I recommend it to anyone .	1
before this the racing games were race around a track and did not have to save the game . then when gt1 came out the racing really improved dramatically you can unlock cars tracks . plus you can save and you can upgrade in this one i believe . after this every game then racing games started to be like gt series . this is one of the best and most popular game series from Sony . try this out .	1
This is , by far , undeniably the racing game to have.A game with over 20 cars to choose from ? UNHEARD OF at the time- this game 's got over 150 , folks.A game with true-to-life car physics , sounds , and handling ? GET REAL , right ? Nope , all here.A game with so much customization , import tuner companies piss their pants ? It 's ALL here.Gran Turismo is the original racing simulator that started it all.You start off with a measly 10,000 bucks . That all but gets you a clunker of a car , which , after beating a bunch of driver 's ed tests , you can use to sneak your way through a few races ... .winning a bit of cash and some cars you can either sell or save to tune later ... .until you can finally buy your dream car ( which for me was the Acura NSX Type S-Zero the first time I played through it ) Let me just stress how perfect this game is ... .Sure , your first time through it , you 'll take a hairpin turn at Grand Valley way too fast , spin out of control , scream , yell , and curse at the TV , maybe throw and break your controller as you finish in last place ... .but over time , you 'll feel so much utter control of your car , that any shimmy or shake the car makes while cornering or countersteering or powersliding , you 'll know exactly how to correct it . No two cars in the game handle the same . You have your FF , FR , MR , and 4WD drivetrains.Simply , you have it all here.The graphics in the game push the Playstation to the limit ... .this , GT2 , and R4 : Ridge Racer Type 4 are by far the best-looking racing games on the original Playstation.There are hordes of races to race , and multiple cars to win , so the replay value is through the roof.My absolute FAVORITE part about the game is fine-tuning the gear ratios of a fully-tuned , supercharged turbo monster of a car , and trying to get every last ounce of power out of it for a top speed at the Test Track . I 've literally spent days at a time fiddling with the gear ratios on a car , knowing that someway , somehow , I 'd be able to squeeze another 2 or 3 MPH out of it . Not only that ... .adjusting the car 's ride height affects top speed and acceleration , too ... .My personal best was achieving 274 MPH with the Mitsubishi GTO Twin Turbo MR ... .It took me at least 8 hours to get it from its standard 252 MPH top speed it gets with all of the top performance parts , and no fiddling with gear ratios or anything ... .The one , and ONLY downside to the game is that you only get $ 12,000 for any car you sell that you won from a tournament . Even a car that you KNOW should rake in WAY more than just 12K ... .like say for instance , the TVR Cerbera LM.Other than that , this game is absolute perfection , 10 out of 10 ... .	1
I was looking for a racing video game for my new playstation , and everyone I talked to told me to get Gran Turismo . And now I know why . It 's so fun ! It 's challenging , but not impossible . The graphics are good and realistic , and there are tons of cars to choose from . I really like the simulation mode where you can race for money and buy new cars or upgrade old ones . I 'm a huge fan of my Dodge Viper with racing stripes.One thing that 's not so great about this game is the space that it takes up on your memory card . Just to have a simulation mode game going , you need 5 empty blocks . If you want to get into saving replays and stuff , it can use up to 15 blocks . Memory cards are expensive ... I 'm not willing to devote an entire memory card to one game , no matter how great it is .	1
i play this game with the interact wheel this game is very fun not as good as the other ones thoe 8/10	1
always love Gran turismo so I wanted the ones from PS1 . This came in good condition , and with all the manuals too . Pretty sweet this game is almost 15 years old and it 's still around	1
Graphics : 8/10 - You can see some of the computerised effects you crash or something , but all of the graphics in this game look good and give feel to the competition.Sound : 8/10 - There could be a bit more commotion when you crash or flip or something , but the engines vrooming gives you a thrill and the creaking sound of the breaks is eye-widening.Value : 10/10 -This game is seriously worth the money . The word value is essential when buying a game and you get your money 's worth and more . In short : get it now ! Overall : 9/10 - Fabulously entertaining and complex car game that really lives up to its reputation . You 'll be playing it in your sleep !	1
This game does seem a bit lacking after playing the other games in the franchise , but holds up well if you do n't mind the graphics.Buyer beware . Watch out for copies that do n't read Greatest hits on . Seems there was a bug that would n't allow you to get 100 % in the game . These copies alway have been known to wipe out your garage .	1
When this game came out I was a pimply faced highschool kid . All I wanted was a car heck even a drivers license would do . The closest thing I could get to driving a real car was playing games like well ... playing games like ... . ummm ? well ... THERE WERE NO GAMES EVEN CLOSE TO DRIVING A REAL CAR ! Then one day at funcoland I picked up a magazine and read about this new game comming out called Gran Turismo , and how it was the ultimate car game . They used real cars and physics to make the game that much authentic . It was the closest a pimply faced highschool kids dream come true . This was n't just another mash the gas driving game ... this was a revolutionary driving experience.I slapped my 20 bucks down on a preorder that day . When Gran Turismo was realised ... it changed all driving games as you know it . All I remember was this being the first driving game that took cars seriously , and I do n't know about you , but the first time I loaded in that Disk , and saw all those car names flashing across the screen I almost wet my pants in exctasy . This was the driving game I had been waiting for my entire life ! Never had there been so much detailed paid to a vehicle in a game . I mean everysingle aspect was there , even a car wash ! I have no idea how many hours I spent playing that game , but took up heaps of my time afterschool . The game was an instant legend , and if you did n't own it , did n't play it , or did n't know someone who had or did , you might as well as hung yourself with your Sega Saturn power chord . The game was just that good.Even to this day I do n't think anything has quite impacted or revolutionized racing games ... other than the idea of online game play . But , this was the game that gave birth to it all . Sure over the years there have been many platform editions of the game , but there is only one true gran turismo , and that 's the original . If your looking for this game today , its because you want to add it to your ps1 collection , and this is a game well worth having if you missed out on it . As for me , I have my memory cards sitting in the garage , just incase someone wants to Challenge my Dodge Viper GTS-R one day .	1
This is the very first gran turismo game made . It is very fun and allot easier than the others . There r so many different cars in this game , not even close to the amount as the newer ones but it has allot for the first game . The graphics r good for the ps1 but i have seen better . The cars slow down every time they hit a wall so that is one thing i hate and most of the tracks r only ment for a couple racers not six or more . That makes the track very hard to race on . In the quick race it lets u get better but it only has about twenty cars and ten tracks but it is fun if u play it on multiplayer . That is the reason that i like this game so much , it has a great multiplayer . It does get boring after awhile but it is a fun game .	1
I bought this game as I wanted to complete my GT collection . I have been looking for a while to find this game at a reasonable price , and Amazon did n't let me down in finding it . I have played it , and it is n't the best compared to today 's standards , but I have it more or less to complete the collection .	1
First of all I am from Guatelama , back then in 1998 , I was saving to get my nintendo 64 system . But one day my older brother , went to a videogame store planning to by the 64 with Mario . I had already sold my SNES , and i was just waiting to begin collecting stars . Then when my bro came by , He was carrying a bag with a Playstation Box and a rare game called Gran Turismo.I was really mad , until he connected it , and when the Sony logo appeard , I was shocked , sound , graphics etc , from the video of Gran Turismo the presentation , to my first race , that was it , I forgot everything about nintendo , except of Killer Instinct , but thats how it started.The other Gran Turismos are obviolusly better , but this is the one that made the leap . like , MGS , FFVII , and all those awesome PS1 games that changed how we play right now . Gran Turismo is that kind of game that not everyone loves , specially the arcade ones , but its simply amazing . The best of its kind and time.By that time a NFS normaly had no more than 15 - 20 cars , and this changed it forever with more than 160 cars . If you want a realistic experience buy a PS3 and Gran Turismo 5 , and after that you 'll want to have the collection . I have passed the 5 of them , including the prologue , it takes time , but that why i am paying.Characteristics : + 160 cars and customizable , first time in history11 detailed tracksreal PhisicsBest racing graphics until Gran Turismo 2 and so on.most realistic control until ... .GT2 and so on tooThe best quaility in menus , and a revolutionary simulation mode , also an arcade mode.First time ever replays and to save you replay too.Simply a classic .	1
I played this game for the first time some thirteen years ago and I was blown away . In the days of 32 bit graphics on PlayStation , this was as good as it was going to get for car games . While EA had the arcady Need For Speed franchise , Sony and Polyphony Digital 's first foray into simulation racing was absolutely fantastic . As the first entrant into the series that is now up to GT5 ( I do n't care what the negative reviews say , that game is great ! ) , this shines as the title that started it all . I wo n't go into the nuances of the game here because others have done so before me . If you are chronologically inclined like I tend to be , and you want to start the series at its genesis before moving on to the later games , there is no better place to start that right here at GT1 . Be forewarned , of course , that the graphics on your HD TV will be a little lacking ... ok , a lot lacking . With all the cars , setups , tracks , and races to make up for it , the now suspect graphics wo n't matter at all . Get ready for the first drive of your life .	1
Effortlessly dusting the competition , Gran Turismo flashes past the finish line with slick controls and stellar gameplay . It 's easily the best of the PlayStation 's realistic racing games.Starting off in the garage , Turismo scores big with 166 real-life cars , ranging from the lowly Honda Civic to the high-end dream machines like the Corvette , Viper , and Toyota Castrol Supra . The excellent selection of tracks delivers plenty of variety , and Turismo performs like a winner with no draw-in , speedy load times , and blazing-fast action . But gameplay is where Turismo really rocks . A fast , pick-up-and-play Arcade mode , along with topnotch two-player split-screen racing , positions Turismo at the head of the pack for casual racing fans . And hardcore racers who delve into the amazing Sim mode will uncover impressive depth . It 's almost like fantasy league racing-you test for licenses , participate in a wide array of events , buy and maintain as many cars as you can afford , and even upgrade their performances with a vast multitude of parts.Need for Speed III may have more flash , but Turismo 's got more game . It 's one of the must-buy titles of this summer .	1
this by far one of the best gran turismo on ps1 driving the skyline with 947hp wow i still remember my supra back in 2001 on my brothers old ps1 i used to watch my brother play this game and winning the races and selling cars he would always race on the test track and the ring speedway track i still do it on my ps3 ..	1
This is the original that started it all . If you can you past the fact that it is quite dated , you will absolutely love everything about this title . The gameplay is rock-solid , and the game moves really fast . Camera is great , as the whole game is viewed from a bird 's eye perspective . The game is very open ended , and you will never get bored while playing this .	1
The first installment in the GTA franchise , this game is awsome , the story is simple and the gameplay is fun .	1
I remember when my parents got me this game for Christmas 8 years ago ! That was good times ! Liberty City 's based on New York City featuring Brocklyn based on Brooklyn , Kings based on Queens , Brix based on Bronx , Manhaddan based on Manhattan , but no island based on Staten Island ! Liberty City 's bordered by the Garden State of New Guernsey based on the Garden State of New Jersey ! Very decent graphics by 1997 standards ! Realistic car controls ! Realistic gun fights ! No so realistic fist fights . Good music ! There are 2 more cities to unlock such as the unidentified city in the Golden State of San Andreas based on San Francisco , California and Vice City in the Sunshine State of Florida based on Miami , Florda ! So get out there , grab a car , and have some fun !	1
This is where it all started . If your and old school gamer you 've probably already played this . And if not it is a great game . If your a GTA fan but have n't played this it is a must to truly understand how great and innovated this series is and has become . If your not a fan of old school gaming though you may not like it .	1
The original Grand Theft Auto was a classic for the PC , but it 's gleefully unabashed violence , simple graphics , dark humor , and addictive gameplay garnered the game much appeal and controversy . Eventually Take 2 Interactive ( now they 're called Rockstar ) published GTA on as many systems as it could : the PS1 , Dreamcast , and even the Game Boy Color . These days anyone and everyone are GTA nuts , but only when it comes to GTA 3 or Vice City . The original GTA may seem simple enough , but it is undeniably fun for the most part , no matter how simplistic the graphics seem . The missions can get rather tedious , and the fact you ca n't save your progress in game ( a problem which would be corrected in GTA 3 ) , and eventually you 'll lose interest , but for the most part the original GTA is still loads of fun . Those who have only played GTA 3 or Vice City will not like this original installment , but it 's a great ride while it lasts .	1
and you just became part of it.Pros : Brought violence and profanity in videogames to a whole new levelVery good sound effectslong enjoyable levels and misionsA short , but destructable arsenoalVery useful cheat codes ( Despit I usally do n't cheat ) Pretty good musicCons : The graphics are plain out horribleone shot death ( A bit too realistic ) well , unless you have armorCa n't save until you beat a leveldefinitly not for kidsThe game suffers from slowdowns , if too many things are on the screenIn 98 this game was jst a instant classic , despite being overshadowed by loads of games ( especially Metal Gear Solid , and Zelda : Ocorina of time ) . It 's definitly unknown since GTA 3 and Vice City overshadowed it by a loooong mile , but yet I still play this game from time to time . In this game you could even say ... the police and let them eat the gat , take out a squad of them with a machine gun , blaze them up with a flame thrower , or just blow them away with almighty rocket launcher ( That was propably the main reason this game got a lot of heat form contaversy ) . If you 're used to GTA 3 or Vice City , then this game will hardly be interesting to you , but if you have this game , then I 'm sure you appreciate the joy the classic burng to you , and took you on the crazy ride from this , all the way to vice city.Final Words : Speaking of Vice City , That was one of the levels in this game , and so was liberty City , and San Anderess is the last city . Could San Andress be the next Grand Theft Auto ? Hmmmm ... peace	1
This game has all the violence and language of the current popular Grand Theft Auto games packing into a convenient 2D package ! : )	1
This was the first real game I ever played along with the first I ever owned . Despite the fact that I 've grown out of many kids games and spend my time focused on M-rated games with a lot of violence or sexual themes , this is one of those games I most definitely have not grown out of . I love the tracks , the weapons , the characters ( Yoshi 's my favorite ) , and simplely how much fun this game still delivers to this very day . The replay value is endless , and multiplayer is still very engaging ( It 's always fun to humiliate your friends at this game ) . This game is what got me started on games and it will continue to be one of my most memorable games in my life as a gamer .	1
It has spawned such classic levels ( as I recall ) such as Luigi 's Circuit , Moo Moo Farm , Frappe 's Snowland , Toad 's Turnpike , Koopa Troopa Beach , Banshee Highway , Bowser 's ( infamous ) Castle , Wario 's Stadium and the ridiculously long and bright track , Rainbow Road , which has spawned at LEAST 5 different versions throughout the series ! My all-time favorite level in the game is actually Sherbet Land . It 's filled with ice and is just fun to cruise through ! And the penguins that you can run into are so cute ! The playable characters are your basic eight : Mario ( balance ) , Luigi ( balanced ) , Princess Peach ( lightweight ) , Toad ( lightweight ) , Yoshi ( advanced ) , Donkey Kong ( heavyweight ) , Wario ( heavyweight ) and Bowser ( the heavi '' est '' weight ) .This game is very , VERY easy to just pick up and play with friends . The controls are simple as all get out and the characters look pretty cool , for a N64 game . The sounds they make are cool too ! If you want something that 4 guys ( and/or girls ) can enjoy , this is the right move ! * PROS *-Bright , colorful boards.-Addicting sound effects.-Semi-interesting characters.-Fun tracks.-4-Way BATTLE . Nuff said.-8 Semi-unique characters* CONS *-Sound comes through in 1-player or 2-player mode , but fails to when playing with 2 or 3 friends-16 levels just is n't enough to satisfy the average gamer 's thirst-The music can be annoying/nauseating to some-When you 're in 1st , you get crappy items . When you 're last , you get the best ones , usually landing you in 1st/2nd/3rdCons aside , I spent countless hours with friends that I cherished playing this game . It will bring smiles to your faces for months to come . If you like this and own a Nintendo DS or a DS Lite ( shame on ALL of you who do n't ! ) , then I totally recommend Mario Kart DS also . More levels and more mayhem . Did I mention even more characters ? ! 4.5 stars .	1
even with all the improvements in systems , games , graphics , etc. , this one remains a classic in all sense of the word .	1
People say GoldenEye was a much multiplayer than this game , but I 've spent more happy hours racing my friends in Mario Kart 64 than blowing people up with proximity mines in the Complex in GoldenEye.Lots of people extol the graphics in GoldenEye , but graphics in Mario Kart 64 is better . First of all , it has a lower polygon count and the characters look much better . The gameplay is simple , but that only means it 's easier to learn . The card that comes with the game tells you everything you need to know so all you have to do is plop the game inside the console and start playing.So the characters do n't say much . It 's mainly just a simple & quot ; Yippee ! & quot ; or & quot ; I'm-a Wario and I'm-a gon na win ! , & quot ; but there 's much more in-game speech than GoldenEye . Sound effects are fine too . The soundtrack is excellent . It ranges from coutry to smooth jazz . Even some major critics of video game music I know have said that the music here is great . You know Koji Kondo 's doing something right hearing that.Mario Kart 64 is addicting with four players , and it can be addicting with one player too . The Time Trials may be a little disappointing , but the Mario GP had me coming back for more.The game is one of the best racing games on the N64 . It 's better than WaveRace , Diddy Kong Racing , F-Zero X , and even Excitebike 64 . Heck it 's one of the best games on the N64 ! If you have n't played this game , then you do n't know what you 're missing .	1
This was the first 'Kart ' game quite like this.. there is n't any 'Kart ' game like this either outside of the Mario franchise . If you think you can find a better Karting game out there , I 'd like to see you find it and show me , because from my finds and plays , this is the only game that is worth playing . From DK to Bowser , Peach to Toad , this game has most of the characters that have been involved with Mario in some way . The graphics are great for its time , the sound is fun , the worlds are colorful , the idea is great . Who would n't like this game- at ANY age ? I 'm not sure , but if you do n't , you amy need to see a doctor . This is the best Kart game ever , and the best Mario Kart game ever .	1
I have loved this game from day 1 . I was happy to find it and receive it quickly and safely .	1
Cool game.But I think Toad is the fastest of the crew . I usedto be an expert at it.I was even born an expert ... .	1
Excellent game all around except one thing ... .The game CHEATS.You can be in first place and magically all the computer controlled racers somehow manage to catch up to you anyway.Now , if you 're in last place you literally have no chance of catching up.Not fair.Not cool.That aside ... .if you develop your skills you 'll still win.After much practice I still managed to beat the game even though it blatantly cheats.Great graphics.Every character you love from the Mario universe.I think Toad is my favorite , when he gets hit LOL . The noise he ( it ? ) makes is hilarious.The courses are inventive and enjoyable.The music fits in perfectly.Did I mention it cheats ? That 's my only complaint.Otherwise another five star winner from Nintendo.Highly recommended .	1
This is a must-have for your N64 . It is fun to play by yourself , but the most fun is when you play with 1-3 friends . : ) The graphics are not the greatest , but it usually does n't affect the gameplay . A classic N64 game .	1
I used to play this game all the time when I was a kid . I recently came into an N64 and just had to get it . Game works perfectly and it arrived quickly .	1
This is an excellent game ! Once you start playing you can not stop until you actually beat it ! This has averythingn a GOOD game should have : Excellent graphics , excellent gameplay , good2-player mode , and good sound . The only flaw in this game is ... well ... their are no flaws , this game gets a SOLID 5 . Thanks for reading my review . Happy Gaming . P.S . Do n't buy Pokemon Snap ... Thanks !	1
Truly a classic . This game was one of the first I got for the N64 , and it is one of my favorites today . As it gives graphics that were hardly ever seen in the early N64 days , it also has gameplay almost unmatched by the games of it 's era . The sound is moderate , but sound isnt a very big facter in deciding the rating of the game.A followup on the early SNES version that was also a hit , this game was certainly watched before it 's release date , as it stormed into the N64 world and took many fans ( as you can see from it 's very high review in many chances ) right away . It was considered as a very high class game then , and now too . Many of the N64 owners today have one in their hands , and many of those have played the game for over 24 hrs.This game has wonderful graphics and sound for the era that it was made in . The size of a typical game back then , but with the technical advancements of some of the games today . The graphics are very good , as you can distinguish all characters and objects faster than immediatly . The game also shows no slow down rate no matter how many characters or items are on the screen at the same time . The sound is entertaining for a while , and it is different for almost all of the 16 courses , showing wonderful compositions with goofy sound added noises at parts.The gameplay is also great . You may pick one of 8 characters to race with . On a small go - cart , you must race on one of the 16 courses and try to get in first . There are many modes . You can race with a group of 8 racers in a grand prix mode , where you may race a total of 4 races and accumulate points . A vs. mode race will put you against a friend or 2 ( or 3 ) in a single race . There is also a battle mode , which will put you against 1 to 3 other players where the last one alive wins.The items in the game play a big part . Some will boost your speed , while some are used to slow down enemies . Some steal enemies items , and some let you do things such as go invincible or invisible . Most of the however , are used to smash your opponents into the air and slow them down . In battle , it will be used as one of 3 hits to destroy the enemy.The characters are the typical mario game characters : Mario , Luigi , Peach , Toad , Yoshi , Wario , DK , and Bowser . They should all come in handy sometime in the game , and it should be fun to test them all.OVerall , this game is great for having fun . I reccommend it to any one . Great for technology too . This game is right for you .	1
This is a really cool game . I played this to death i do n't know how many times , sometimes alone and at times with a partner.It 's really tragic if you do n't have this game when you own an N64 , you do n't know what you 're missing out on.Um ... well , this game is pretty easy and you do n't really need a strategy guidebook for this one . I think the only reason why it 's so damn fun is because on every track and race , you can race it differently . You can try new tricks or even attempt to create your own shortcut-if you are that good ! Graphics-wise , it 's all a let-down , i was expecting realistic models but i got cartoony characters , but then again- it 's mario and friends , right ? As a mario fan- you 'll want to have this in your hands and if you 're not- then play this as a party game . It beats Mario Party in replay value but is somewhat less challenging.So bottomline- it 's a little too easy . But that will not prevent it from being a top 100 game of all time ( read EGM # 100 ) ... .	1
This game is one of two reasons to buy an N64 . It 's excellent multiplayer , with enough shortcuts and tricks to perfect that 's it 's also a great solo game . If you have an N64 and you do n't have this game , then you should stop wasting your time and go out and buy it . You could play the other games , but they are terrible ...	1
This is the best racing game i 've ever played and the most funest . The game has a cool unique to a racing game . it is tons of fun , and you can play either Mario , Luigi , Peach ( The Princess ) , Toad , Yoshi , Bowser ( King Koopa ) & Donkey Kong . There are three types of trophies you can recieve , either the Mushroom trophy , Flower Trophy , Star Trophy and A Special Trophy . Cool Hu . Well this game was tons of fun i recomend it to everyone . Peace OutIf you liked this game then check out all of the Mario Games .	1
Ahhhh ! I love this game ! It 's so great . My friend gave it to me and I fell in love with it fast ! I played Mario Kart for the SNES and thought it was the best thing since sliced bread . When I found out Mario Kart was for N64 , I went bezerk . This was the first game to my N64 collection . You choose between 8 characters . You can get over 10 different powerups , including the legendary star which makes you invincible , banana peels which make opponents skid out of control , lightning bolts which makes characters small so you can smush them , mushrooms that boost your engine , and 3 kinds of shells . A green shell will go and bounce off anything , A red shell will do its best to find a character and smash them , and a spike shell with automatically find the player in 1st place and destroy them without fault . The reason it is 4 stars is because they did n't go the extra mile . If you play 1 or 2 player ( s ) you can do a Grand Prix , but not with 3 or 4 . In player 1 mode you cant do a battle or do a vs. with the CPU . Battle only contains 4 tracks . I guess what i 'm trying to say is that i wish it was more open . Taking shortcuts wo n't work because Lukita drags you back when your at the top of the mountain . This game would be the best if you were allowed to do more .	1
When I had this game , I did not stop playing until I got to winning the game . It 's fun for awhile to throw objects at people that are racing against you . It has a four player mode , which is not bad , but sometimes gets a little confusing when you 're watching other people racing . The split screen should never be included . Although , that it is which is easy to get distracted . But Mario Kart is fun and it should be in one of the hand-held games , too . I would n't mind playing this . Oh , I have the one on Gameboy Advance , which is cool but not like the one from Nintendo 64 . Now , that confused me .	1
It plays great and i look forward to beating my fance . We place bets on who will win and the looser has to do the chores .	1
mario kart 64 is by far the best n64 gameif you want non-violent racing with all the nintendo characters for a good price- look no furtheralso if you like mario kart 64 , you might likemario kart dsmario kart super curcuitmario kart snes	1
Mario Kart 64 , the sequel to the first Mario Kart game on the SNES is great . Nintendo got rid of some of the things that made the SNES title so much fun , but added a lot too . The gameplay is much more enhanced , the characters look much better and the individual go-karts are very realistic.Like the SNES version , this game includes 3 modes of play : GP ( Grand Prix ) , Battle , and Time Trial . In GP you choose one of 8 characters : Mario , Luigi , Peach , Toad , Wario , Yoshi , Donkey Kong , and Bowser in a large variety of courses in the Mushroom Cup , Flower Cup Star Cup , or Special Cup ( which you unlike by getting gold trophies in each of the 3 basic courses ) in 50cc , 100cc , or 150cc mode . 50cc is the easiest , but in 100cc and 150cc the computer gets much faster and more challenging . There are several items you can collect by driving through the question mark boxes which help you during each race . Lightning bolts ( the rarest item to get ) makes all of the other opponents small , mushrooms give you a speed burst , banana peels make one of your opponents crash if they slip on it , red shells are used to shoot directly at an opponent to get them off course , and green shells keep bouncing off the walls until it hits one of the racers . Unlike the SNES Mairo Kart game , there are several objects you need to avoid to stay on course . In different races there are trucks and cars that will make you crash if you hit them , snowmen that will blow up if you hit them , and many other obstacles in different courses.In Battle mode you and up to 3 others choose one of the 8 characters . You drive around a course trying to pop each other 's 3 balloons . You can pop their balloons by shooting red or green shells at them or throwing banana peels at them to make them slip . You can also use the other items to avoid being hit by them . Once all of your balloons are popped you become a bomb which you can drive around the course trying to run in to the other players . This mode is a lot of fun , especially if you get tired of continually playing Grand Prix mode.In Time Trial mode you race in any of 15+ courses and try to set records for each lap and/or race.The controls for Mario Kart 64 are very simple and easy to master , and the music and sound effects are great as well.If you want a great racing game for your N64 , I highly recommend that you check out Mario Kart 64 .	1
It 's a classic , anyone that has a N64 should have this game .	1
Classic racing game . If you love racing games you should consider getting this game . You race around tracks throwing random stuff so that you can win . The graphics are great -- I mean during that time the graphics are great , you ca n't really argue about that .	1
Graphics : 9/10 - Eye-catching , bold and pretty , Mario Kart 64 's graphics are fulfilling and nice to look at.Sound : 8/10 - Lots of bells , whistles , engines and da-da 's in this game . They are just small sound , but bring out some sort of livelihood.Value : 8/10 - Even though I do n't have a Nintendo 64 , if I did , I would probably buy this game because it is lots of fun to play . It can also be very strategic at times , which is good for a racing car game.Overall : 8/10 - Nothing too memorable , but it 's delightfully entertaining to play when you are actually using the controls . Mario Kart 64 gives you things to do and stuff to work out . It 's the first game I played on Nintendo 64 and as far as I 'm concerned , it 's well worth the time .	1
This game is really fun , but I honestly enjoyed Crash Team Racing for the PlayStation a lot more . One thing that annoys me about this game is that you ca n't look behind you . I pressed every button and I ca n't get the camera to face behind the racer and this makes it impossible to shoot green turtle shells from behind without proper aiming . So nine out of ten times , I 'm going to miss my target . How did Nintendo screw up this badly . And the racers are pre-rendered much like how Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong were in Donkey Kong Country for the SNES . I was wondering why was n't it computer generated like Super Mario 64 ? It 's still a nice little game , a little pricey , but still nice to have in your N64 collection .	1
Mario Kart : 64 . It is such an improvement from the Super Nintendo version . The graphics are quite detailed in comparison to the other 64 games out . I would say , above average . However , the graphics is not what sets this game off above the others . It is the enjoyment level ! Not only is it fun to compete with others like your family , friends , or even the computer player ( AI ) but it 's got a great Grand Prix mode in which you can compete for a Gold Cup . Get all gold Cups and you gain a bonus.The only complaint I have about this game , ( reason why I gave it a four instead of a 5 ) is that the AI are too smart . Races sometimes seem to be unfair . You throw items at them , knock them to the side , speed ahead of them and it seems like whatever you do , it does n't matter . This can be frustrating . Though the controls are WAY improved over the Super Nintendo version , it still is hard to control the carts ( karts ) around corners.Overall , this is an addicting game.Have a Super Nintendo ? Buy Mario Kart for Super NintendoHave a Gamecube ? Definetely buy Mario Kart : Double Dash for Gamecube.And finally , if you have a N64 , Mario Kart 64 is one to deeply consider	1
After checking GameSpot 's ( author 's note : this was originally posted exclusively on GameSpot.com ) and a few user reviews , I absolutely had to throw my two cents in . I could n't help but laugh when I read the introduction of `` Even with all its bells and whistles , Mario Kart 64 is very likely to disappoint you after about a week . `` When I picked up this game initially , my thoughts were `` SWEET ! A new Super Mario Kart ! '' I , unfortunately , never had an SNES of my own , so my fixes came in the form of time at my friend 's house.This game is absolutely spectacular in every way . Yes , I do feel that it could benefit from maybe a higher difficulty level and there is also the fact that it 's possible to clinch a Gold medal in a circuit ( 4 races ) after finishing in the top spot in each of the first three races . However , other than these minor spots , I find it to be flawless . Everything from the graphics to the sound to the features are great . There is also a great amount of multiplayer available in this , with not only the up to four player split-screen , but the track ghosts as well . Track ghosts are saved data of your best race ( single player only ) on a course . The game saves not only your time but your entire race . When you race against your ghost , you can actually compare yourself second-by-second on the tracks and this also helps you to analyze spots and what you did to help you become a better racer.The items are what really make multiplayer fun , though . I 've had many a time where I have something such as a ghost ( which lets you steal and item and makes you invisible/invincible ) while my friend had a lightning bolt ( shrinks all opponents ) and it 's a quick reaction race to see who can get their item deployed first . To me , however , there is nothing more satisfying than hitting your opponent ( especially if it 's a friend instead of the computer ) with a green shell ( a shell that fires straight out , as opposed to the red homing shells ) as he 's about to cross the finish line to win , not just the race , but the circuit as well . And , yes , I actually did that to a friend of mine . Talk about bragging rights.Up to this point , I have kept ( or at least tried to keep ) retro-rating out of this review and I was considering dropping one of the five rankings to a 9 because I 'm stingy with giving out perfect 10 's . If I had rated this game when it first came out , it would probably be rated somewhere around 9.7 to 9.9 . However , there is one reason , and one reason only , that I still own my N64 -- and that is to play Mario Kart 64 ... a decade later . ( Note : I ca n't even say that about Zelda : OoT or GoldenEye . ) That , in itself , I think warrants the move up to the perfect 10 rating . ... I guess this pretty much means that I 'll have to give Super Mario Kart a 10 as well . I guess we 'll see when I finally get it on Virtual Console . ( For those of you who ask `` Virtual Console ? Why '' Read : paragraph 2 . ) Overall : 10Gameplay : 10Graphics : 10Sound : 10Value : 10Tilt : 10	1
I bought Mario Kart 64 for my nephew for his birthday . I played Mario Kart 64 when I was a little and I loved it . My nephew already has Mario Kart DS and he loves it . I figure that he will love this game too . Mario Kart 64 has many different levels in which you can race other Mario characters such as Luigi , Wario , Donkey Kong , Bowser and many others . I would recommend this game to anyone who likes any of the newer Mario Kart games .	1
This game is an old racing game but heck , its better then half of them out now.With all the crazy weapons , it can keep you goin awile.This game is really worth it if u have a nintendo 64.This is still 1 of my favorite games .	1
Mario Kart 64 this game is fun you 'll play this over and over . My favorite board is Mushroom level it 's easy that 's why and you pick up items to used from keeping your opponent from taking the lead . Great buy .	1
I got this game in '97 and it is still fun to play . Unlike the original Mario Kart for the SNES or the new Mario Kart Super Circuit for the GBA ( both of these games you have to use a control pad to drive ) you can use the control stick on the N64 controller ot drive your go-kart which is a hundred times easier than a control pad . The game is easy in the begining , but it hets much harder as you get closer to finishing it . The graphics are spectacular , and so is the music . In one course you can go off roading and drive around and look at Princess Toadstool 's castle form Super Mario 64 ! The tracks are cleverly designed and all to often you 'll find yourselft barely winning or completing a race . The game does offer a good challenge with eight drivers to choose from which onclude the following and their speed : Mario average , Luigi average , Peach average , Toad fast , Yoshi fast , Donkey Kong slow , Wario slow , Bowser slow . The speeds come to play in the later levels where only Toad and Yoshi are your best bet for first place . Again with the GBA and the Gamecube ( which launched today as I am writing this ) Mario Kart 64 is a must have for N64 owners who ca n't get the Gamecube or the GBA for now . Also each character has his or her own course and the game has race and battle multiplayer modes where in the battle mode each racer has three balloons arround his or her go-kart and everyone has to try to knock out everyones balloons . Have fun !	1
This game was shipped quickly , and was in very good condition . I have great memories of playing this game when I was young , and now my son and I can make new memories . Thanks very much ! !	1
My favorite part of this game is the battle mode . My friend showed me all the tricks he has learned from playing it . Like where to set traps and other stuff . The one player mode is fun too .	1
Mario Kart on the n64 is an extremly well made game . when one person plays the game for the first time the controls are easy and you do n't nead to worry about changing gears . After you get better you can move on to harder levels of play . once you beat the game on 150cc ( hardest level ) you can race al track in mirror mode ( all tracks have opposite turns then their original tracks ) . the ads more replay value because the game in a sence has new tracks . All the tracks are unique and have varied difficulty levels . they are also well designed.The graphics in mario kart are bright simple and full of color . the music in the game is not very good but it does not mater because of the great sound effects provided by the characters.As with all great n64 games this one accells in the multiplayer department . It will appeal to people of all ages . you can choose from 3 different multiplayer modes battle championship single race . The most fun out of all of those is batlle because you go around getting items then try to hit your friends with any item you get . if you hit your'e oponent they 'll lose a balloon they have 3 ballons.This is a party game i would recommend over any mario party game and definitly over didy kong racing . this is a classic n64 game no one shoild be without .	1
I love all the Mario Kart games , this one has some of the coolest tracks . Yoshi Valley is the best track I 've ever played and the graphics are pretty good too . Small selection of characters ( if you 've got the one for Gamecube ) but still a blast . Awesome 1 player or multiplayer game , a must have for parties ! Good anytime and that 's hard to find .	1
This mario kart is my favorite of any in the series , and i am so glad i bought it because i have had so much fun	1
This game I grew up with and enjoy very much . I have been playing this game since I was 6 or 7 years old and games like these are very hard to come by right now and they cost a pretty penny brand new . What I have is a like new version but unforutantely I lost the manuel and the box is long gone to mine but maybe I will find it one day while I shop around the internet . I love this game and recommend this game to old school video game players and the like .	1
The price was reasonable , and the game shipped relatively quickly . Most importantly it works . What else could you ask for ?	1
Mario Kart is definetly the most classical game ever for racing . But maybe even the most classical game Nintendo has ever made.This game has three different levels . One is data which keeps track of your best time for the particular track and you get three mushroom guys who give you a boost up forward but there are no diamonds to get a specialty like a star or something . ( I 'll explain about the special items later so you know what there for before you might play the game ) In options you can see your data records for each track showing the best lap and the top 5 races in time with the particular racer on it ( Not names instead they show . Mario , Peach , Bowser , Wario , Yoshi , Dk , Luigi , and my personal favorite which is Toad ) ONLY DO FOR ONE PLAYER ! Another one of the things you can do in Mario Kart is do Mario Kart G.P where you compete with all the other racers while picking your own . Before you start the screen will show 4 different brackets which have 4 tracks each and you pick the bracket you want . After each race it 'll show the score of each racer in points which goes that if you place 5th through 8th you get no points . 4th gets 1 , 3rd gets 3 , 2nd gets 6 , and 1st gets 9 . At the end of the of all the races the top three racers will stand on that olympic where it says 1,2 , and 3 ranging as 1 the highest and 3 the lowest . After it shows the three racers om each of their spots it will show a trophy to you in bronze silver or gold and then your player says something like `` YEAH '' . Oh yeah their are diamonds in this mode.Then their is a single game which you only play one game against the computer or against friends at any course you or your friend wants to play at.Finally which you might 've been waiting to hear is about the freaking DIAMONDS . While your racing their will be diamonds around and if you go through one it will show a box showing which specialty you 've gotten . The long list of specialties are , one red shell which if you throw at someone within a certain distance they will fly up and back down making you get ahead . Also there 's a 3 red shell specialty where it shows three red shells going around your car and it does the same thing as 1 red shell would do . The green shells are totally opposite from the red one it comes in threes and ones and when you throw it will just bounce off the sides of the course back and forth going preety slow but preety much the only way you can hit another player with a green shell is if the racer is almost or is right in front of you . But the bowser shell which you dont get often but if you do get it you can throw it from anywhere and it will get the closest player ahead of you but if your in first place the shell is worthless . Also preety much everybody 's favorite specialty is the star where you can go really fast to catch up for about 10 seconds and if your it by anything it 'll just back off of you and you will stay up because you can do that the game also lets you knock people over if you headed straight at them and bumped them . Sorry if this is boring but if you want to hear about the game and you will buy it you should listen to the rest . You get bananas in 8 's and 1 's . Bananas you just drop on the ground and racers might crash into them and start slipping on the floor . The last specialty is ghost where nobody can see you and if a specialty hits you , you will just keep one going.My favorite mode is battle where you have to have 2 or more players . In battle their are 4 different modes . During battle you have 3 ballons with diamonds on the ground when you get hit you lose a ballon and when you have lost all three ballons you become a bomb to go get other players . As a bomb you cant get any specialties but if you bump in to any racers you will be done as a bomb but that racer will lose a ballon . By the way computers can not play in this mode.This should be enough to know how this game is and I hope that you buy this game because you will probably like it.This game is a classic which I 've said before.P.S ( ... ) good bye and have a nice day !	1
Probably a top three game as far as popularity is concerned on the n64 . Just a simple racing game with the original Mario cast , but a game that was a lot of fun . Multiplayer mode was even better as it made for real good fun competition amongst friends . Truly a classic game that is a must for n64 collection .	1
Mario Kart 64 is one of that games that is hard to find , but that effort has a very good reward , 'cuz this is one o'that games that began the real 4-player madness ( you know ... ) , it 's also considered as one of the best Mario Kart games ever ( better than Mario Kart : Double Dash ! ! , and maybe as good as Mario Kart Wii ) . The only thing that I did n't give the 5/5 is that this game is a bit tedious . Yes , I know that graphics ... forget about the graphics , 'cuz first , it 's the N64 , and second , graphics are not important in this game that focus on fun . If you have a 64 , and you do n't have already MK64 , you must find it now ! Everybody with a 64 must have this crazy great game ! ( do n't forget four controllers for the real madness ) .	1
The original Mario Kart for the SNES was fun , and a good effort for the limited capabilities of the SNES platform . Mario Kart 64 made full use of the N64 's 3-D capabilities , making for a very fun and successful game . Up to four players can engage in the game , and the racecourses are as colorful and rich as they are varied . Each character has their own racecourse ( Peach 's castle , Bowser 's castle , Yoshi 's canyons , Donkey Kong 's jungle , and so on and so forth ) plus more that are just fun and varied , like a beach , the desert , snowfields , and the Rainbow Road.You can play against the computer and compete for various cups , and each set of courses has various levels of difficulty . You get cool items to aid your progress on the track ( or hinder the progress of others ) There is also a VS mode where two to four players can battle against one another . Overall this is a really great game for the Nintendo 64 .	1
I remember I was 6 , and I had just gotten a Nintendo 64 . At such a young age most of the games out were too complicated for me and I had to find something I could understand . Enter Mario Kart 64 . This game is pure and simple , you pick a character and race with seven other famous Nintendo stars in 16 detailed ( for N64 , anyway ) stages . This was one of the N64 's first games , so for me it turned the system into a classic which I still play today.This game was much better than Super Mario Kart , and much better than Double Dash . In this game you can choose from 50cc - 150cc ( which is n't much ) , and depending on your speed , this could be very boring , or the ride of your life . I mean seriously , who would n't want to speed down Yoshi Valley at 200 mph ? For its time in '96 , this game was amazing , and I still play it today . I am 15 now , so it has an enormous replay value . And the only stage I dont like is Banshee Boardwalk.If you have a Nintendo 64 ( which not many people do ) , then buy this NOW !	1
This is one of the best games out for the N64 . The races and tournaments themselves are challenging and extremely fun . The many characters that you can unlock all have their own abilities and everything else to set them aside . The tracks are not repetitive and give each race a fresh new layer of fun.Multi-player is an even better experience ... Who could imagine that battles with cars and turtle shells would actually be fun ? Well it is fun and will keep you playing for hours on end . This game will make your friends ask if they can come over and play . A sure hit with a gamer of any age .	1
For Nintendo , some of their most popular games have been revised over and over again . In the case of the Nintendo 64 , the case has happened to itself too . The 1997 Mario Kart 64 game is no acception . The starting flag proves that the light is worth checking out.In this game , you play any of eight characters in 16 traditional courses and 4 battle zones . Choose from Mario , Yoshi , Wario , Peach , Luigi , Toad , Donkey Kong , and Bowser . The graphics are a bit more intact than the other racing games that came later for the system . Although it might try to drown you out a little bit at a time , when you complete the four racing cups quickly . Luckily , the game truly makes up for it in the Vs. mode , where you are head-to-head n a battle with up to four players in the race.Mario Kart is absolutely worth checking out for the Nintendo 64 , despite the fact the Nintendo 64 has no more new games for the system . If you buy it only for yourself , your better off bringing in a partner for the ride .	1
This is my favorite of the series . My cousin and I used to play it all the time and it is how I remember . Hit detection is a little off	1
Like many other people , I absolutely adore racing games and the Mario games . Then I saw this come out . It was perfect ! It was a racing game with the characters from the Super Mario series ! I was so excited to play it . My friends and I played it all night . It was so addicting . In fact , I still play this game today .	1
Mario Kart 64 is an excellent game ! I love the graphics , the creators at Nintendo 64 made them very specific . My favorite modes to play in are either Mario GP , because I love racing against the computer , or Battle , because you have to be alert and careful not to run into in obstacles like bananas or shells ! I really like the & quot ; ghost & quot ; so you can see whether or not you beat your previous time with that course . My favorite course is Yoshi Valley because in many areas , there are no walls to keep you from falling , so it 's a challenge , and I like the big squasher egg ! The one thing that drives me crazy is the fact that the computer can manage to get in front of me while racing without me noticing or even knowing how they did it ! Other than that , this is a great game with excellent graphics and fun for the whole family ! ! I hope you enjoyed my review ! !	1
This mario kart changed all mario karts in the future . This is the first mario kart that has mini games and computer generated graphics . I mean the 64 as u can tell the graphics have changed allot from the snes . This mario kart has many more features and great graphics . The sound is great also . If i had a choice of which mario kart to have for free if i did not have any of them it would be this one . I dont know why but for some reason this one is really fun . It has a great multiplayer , especially on mini games .	1
If you liked Mario Kart for the Super Nintendo , then you will love Mario Kart 64.This is an amazing game . One of the best for the 64 . If you have competition around you can take up hours of play time.I have played this game almost as much as I have Golden Eye 64 , but not quite as much . If you are looking for a good quality game with a very high replay value then this is a great game to check out.Does n't matter if you are 10 or 70 you can get into this game . The multi-player makes things a little bit more interesting . The battle mode is the best feature if you have equal level competition .	1
If you like racing games that are unique , this is for you . You can race by yourself , or with a friend . Not only that , but you can also challenge your friends in battle mode with some really fun arenas . If your more of a solo player like me , do n't worry , there are four different tournaments that you can play.You can even use different items either to slow down the other racers , or to help you pass them up . Of course every item has it 's own effects , there are a few that are hard to get . That 's because they 're special , learn how to use them , and the competition will be eating your dust.And last , but far from least , there is a special mode you can unlock for an even bigger challenge . Yeah , this game will keep you busy no matter how you play . It 's definately a must-have , order it while you can .	1
Mario Kart 64 is , without a doubt , one of the best games ever made for the Nintendo 64 ( or any other system ) . Even today , 8 years after its original release , Mario Kart 64 is still amazingly fun . The controls are PERFECT- and I do mean perfect . The first time you go power sliding around a sharp turn , you 'll see what I mean . The game is perfectly balanced- each character has strengths and weaknesses . Your skill determines if you come in first- not because you picked the best character . Oh , and I have n't even spoken about the brilliant course design . Every course has shortcuts , and special features , making them truely unique . The placement of the powerups is wonderful . And the multiplayer ... Oh the multiplayer ! One word : brilliant . Playing with your friends is exciting , competetive , and will have you laughing like crazy . This is what multiplayer gaming is all about . If the game does have one weakness , it is the graphics ; being 8 years old , Mario Kart 64 does n't stack up well against today 's crop of games in terms of visuals . But when you 're having this much fun with a game , do the graphics matter ? No way ! ! Even if you own the Gamecube version of Mario Kart , you still owe it to yourself to pick up a copy of this timeless classic .	1
I 'd recommend buying it used to save some money . The tracks are nice and the game play is all right . It 's just not the same as playstation racing games though .	1
I use to love this game and after purchasing this one I found I still do . The game was of quality and is still working just fine .	1
Mario Kart 64 is the true 3D Nintendo 64 sequel to Super Mario Kart . Since the characters would n't look so great on karts in 3D on the N64 , the sprites are in 2D , which explains how they are fully detailed.There are 16 courses you can race in , along with 4 courses for your average Battle Mode.Now that there are 4 players , the 2-4 Player modes can be pretty fun , especially 2-Player since it has all the options from 1-Player Mode.The item roster is slightly different from Super Mario Kart , but it 's fun to use them all.Overall , Mario Kart 64 is another game that defines 3D gaming on the Nintendo 64 .	1
I love this game this is the coolest game ever brings back great memories from my childhood playing this game it never gets old to play	1
Mario Kart64 is one of the more entertaining video games of all times . It is suitable for all ages and can be enjoyed and mastered by the young and old . 4-player simultaneous play with a selection of 8 classic Mario characters and 4 different difficulties ( beat all curcuits in 3rd or better to earn Extra Mode ) and 16 levels of play , each level containing it 's own unique obstacles and course .	1
This game is pretty darn easy . I beat most of the tracks with only a rental . It 's not near as tough as the SNES version . Heck , the SNES version of Rainbow Road had no walls around the track and the track was thin to boot . Rainbow Road is a cakewalk on this one . Wide the whole way with walls all around . Too darn easy . However , there is a monster shortcut that 's very dangerous to go for if you want to make things interesting.Even though it was too easy , I bought the game anyway . It 's fun to beat the heck out of these computer controlled suckers . Plus I really like the game 's ending.There is one hard level , the one with all of the traffic in the extra mode . It can be very frustrating if you make a mistake , because you get run over again and again and again . It usually takes away any hope of recovery.The most significant improvement over the SNES version is the time trial mode . You can race a ghost of yourself after you 've already completed the course . The ghost is only a recording of your previous performance , but it gives you a lot more motivation to beat your old time , I assure you.I 've never been into multiplayer modes , but if you 're into that kind of thing , you 'll REALLY love this game . Some multiplayer matches can go on for a LONG time , since the levels are so well-designed .	1
When I first heard of a Mario Kart game comming out for Nintendo 64 I was overjoyed to realize that they would keep up on such an awesome Super Nintendo game . To my amazment , the game came to the 64 with nothing but crisp graphics and pre-rendered characters abound . However , where there comes the good side of all this , there is a bad side ; some of the characters in the game , in fact , cheat to win . Now I 'm not sure why this little feature was allowed , perhaps to make it more challenging or give us more reason to throw the controller at the wall when Mario suddenly jumps out in front of you . However , you can master there cheating ways by learning how to outwit them at their own game . Find shortcuts and other things that can aid you in your race for the finish . From cheating to graphics and music I must say that the graphics are quite impressive for such a game made so early on . The music is also amazing , with hummable tunes that will get you in the mood to race , or the mood to hit Wario off the side of a moutain just to here him scream . The sure thing to do now is to buy the game , because it is a classic and always will be .	1
Anyone who owns a Nintendo 64 and does not own Mario Kart should just throw it away.This is a classic N64 game that 's a ton of funeven today where there are games with better graphics.The point of the game is simple : win the race by any means.There are no plot twists , no complicated storylines.It has all the classic Mario characters includingMario , Luigi , Peach , Bowser , Wario , Toad , Yoshi and others.Once you finish everything , there is a bonus optionwhere you can play all levels again but backwards ! Seriously , this game is an awesome classicand a great addition to any and all N64 game collections.Overall,5/5	1
This has to be one of the best multiplayer games created for the Nintendo 64 . This kind of game is great for all ages . I 'm 18 years old and my friends and I still , to this day , continue to play Mario kart . It is a perfect racing game that has great sound effects and can keep you entertained for hours . You can play it by yourself , but to get the true experience of this game its best to play it with others . There is really no story line to the game , just a bunch of maps and characters to choose to race with . If you get bored of racing over and over again , there are several mini games , known as battle games , to choose from . Honestly , I like playing the battle games more than I like racing because its fun to take down your friends and family ! So , overall I would definitely say get this game if you do n't have it !

this is one of the best star wars / N64 games they have made i say if you have a N64 get this GAME ! ! ! need i say more ?	1
I was never a really big fan of sci-fi , and Star Wars just was n't my thing . I could n't really care less about those darned rebels . Obviously , my expectations for Rogue Squadron that summer day were not very high.But you know what ? I played the first mission and I was pleasantly surprised . The game actually was n't that bad ! It was actually quite entertaining just flying around and shooting these drones out from the sky . The game really is n't that easy to learn , especially if you buy the game used without an instruction booklet . There are basically a lot of nooks and crannies that I have yet to figure out , like what right-C does , or how bombs work . But the introductory missions are fun and pretty easy . However , the gameplay got to be quite repetitive . I mean , you just go around and shoot enemies from the sky . Yay . There are also a lot of sections where you have nothing to do , and it gets boring . Maybe I could have moved on to the third mission.I also realized how visually stunning the game is . I have an Expansion Pak , so I really do n't have a clue what the game would be like without it , but the graphics are just so crisp , at least certain features . The buildings and structures and ships and stuff look great , almost to the level of Half-Life . But the graphics for the people/Storm troopers leave more to be desired . They are obviously sprites . The music does have a Star Wars feel to it , and that 's growing on me . I sometimes get certain tunes stuck in my head , and I do n't mind . Most of the music is in the menus , though . 40 minutes of speech is nice , if only I could understand half of it . Rogue Squadron has no multiplayer , which is too bad . It would have been fun . Oh well . Overall , I actually kind of enjoyed this game .	1
I picked this up in a pack of two other N64 games for five dollars at a used game store . Now usually , those bundle deals have all of the mediocre N64 games in them that no one wants to buy individually . However , Star Wars : Rogue Squadron is easily one of the best N64 games I 've ever played.Story : The game appears to take place between A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back in the Star Wars universe . You 're Luke Skywalker , the original trilogy 's protagonist and a fighter pilot for the Rebel Alliance . You 'll help people with vital intelligence defect from the Empire , protect Rebel-allied cities , and of course fight the Empire ! Gameplay : Unfortunately , you never get to wield a light saber or anything . That 's not what this game is about . It 's a space-shooter . You travel to different planets in your X-wing or one of the other Rebel spaceships and do missions.Sound : There may be an N64 game with more audio than Rogue Squadron , but I 've never played it , if so ( and I 've played entirely too many of them : P ) . There 's so much voice-acting . There 's lengthy descriptions of every ship in the Rebel Fleet , backstories for Rogue Squadron 's fighter pilots , and of course in-level communication between the pilots.Graphics : It 's a very nice job by Factor 5 , here . Of course it looks dated by now , but in the grand scheme of things , I 'd say it 's aged pretty gracefully . Make sure you have an expansion pack for your system to get the full effect.Replay Value : You get medals for doing well enough in every stage . I 'm told that if you get medals in every stage , you can unlock secret missions like the Battle of Hoth from Empire Strikes back and the Death Star run . If that 's not incentive to beat this game 100 % , what is ? It 's clearly a classic N64 game , worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Goldeneye64 and Ocarina of Time . I 'd only that having a decent N64 analog helps.. a lot . If your controller 's analog is dying due to wear and tear , you 'll have a hard time towards the end of the game .	1
I have got to be honest even if it means sacking my reputation . I have never played a game so much before in my life . I only own the N64 still for this game , I have thrown out all others . This game brings such a Movie like experience along with great missions , craft , and imperial action that I have never seen anything to its likeness . You have got to get this game under all circumstances if you are a Star Wars fan .	1
Originally playing Rogue Leader ( Star Wars : Rogue Squadron 2 ) , it 's great to get back to the keystone that started the whole franchise . While not allowing for some of the more advanced gameplay from future games , this product is and was fantastic for the age of N64 era gaming . A much needed classic to add to the collection for sure .	1
There have been many N64 games to brighten up the new generation of gaming . This game not only has sharp graphics , but it also has great gameplay and is very challenging .	1
For the N64 this game is really fun , graphics are amazing , sound quality is alright . If you love flight simulation games then this is definitely for you . You are Luke Skywalker flying around on various fun missions . There are tons of unlockable cheats that can be added for a better fun-filled experience . Get the expansion pack -- which is cheap nowadays .	1
This has to be one of the best Star Wars games ever made . It 's on par with Jedi Knight/Dark Forces 2 and Knights of the Old Republic . It 's one of the first games to nail the dog fights from the 1st Star Wars films . The controls are great and it 's easy to get used to . It shows off planets that are both new and familer from the films like Hoth . If your a Star Wars nut like me , get it ! ! !	1
Well , I 'm going to have to agree with Darth Vader on the strong part . But as for the force part , I 'm nonchalant . Star Wars Rogue Squadron begins somewhere in between Star Wars Episode IV and Episode VI . Let me just say , you 'll be visiting place in the Star Wars universe , and doing missions that have no bearings to the movies , which is good with me . The graphics in the game are some of the best you 'll ever see on the N64 . The music and the atmosophere of the game are very well done . This is , I would say , the best Star Wars Rogue Squadron game ever made ! Oh , and by the way , yes I have played Star Wars Rogue Squadron : Rogue Leader . I fully recommend this game ! And thats my review ! Remember , `` Be a customer . Not a consumer ! Period '' - Jake Smithers	1
This game is great for Star Wars fans ! There are eleven single missions , but there are three bonus missions too . The first is a race on Tatooine where you fly a T-16 Skyhopper in a race against three of your squadron mates ! The second is the Death Star Trench Run which the developers , in my opinion over did , because the trence is HUGE and it has to many turns . The best bonus level is the Battle of Hoth . The graphics and music are superd just like every other Lucasarts and Factor Five 5 game ! Their are also secret vehicles . You can pilot the Naboo Starfighter by using a secret code ( go to Lucasarts website ! ) the Millunium Falcon and the TIE Interceptor can be earned when you complete the game by getting all the gold medals . It does n't take long to beat this game if your good at games like this , but ot does offer a pretty good challenge . Now go join the Rebellion and vaporize those TIE Fighters .	1
THANK YOU FOR THIS GAME , MY NEPHEWS KEEP PLAYING THIS GAME , THEY SAY THAT IT IS SO MUCH FUN , THEY KEEP FIGHTING TO SEE WHO IS GOING TO WIN THE GAME . THANK YOU SO MUCH	1
Rogue Squadron . Every Star Wars fan knows the elite starfighter group of pilots . Now you get the opportunity to experience what it feels like to hop into the cockpit of an X-Wing , Y-Wing , A-Wing , V-Wing , Millenium Falcon , T.I.E . Interceptor , and the Naboo Starfighter . As you fly through over 15 missions , ranging from Tatooine to Mon Calamari , you 'll earn ranks in the squardron & lt ; the highest I 've gotten is Gold Leader & gt ; . With each mission you complete , you 'll earn a medal & lt ; bronze , silver or gold & gt ; and be promoted . Do you have what it takes to buy this game , and prove you 've got what it takes to be a top fighter pilot ?	1
star wars rogue squadron is hands down the best n64 game ever made get this game even if you 're not a star wars fan you wont regret it	1
I loved this game when I first played it ( I still play it even today ) the graphics where awsome , the sound was cool , the levels where all kinds of stratageys and the expansion pack worked great with it . The cheats to fly the falcon , tie fighters , naboo fighter ect all made the game even better . There is even a secret little mini game where you can control a Chicken Walker ( AT-ST ) and shoot up some droids and buildings in a small space.The only downfall is there is no way to get unlimited heat seeker rockets , so you have to turn on your unlimited lives cheat and keep commiting suicide to get more of those rockets to win within the selected times to get the gold medal to become a Jedi . And there is no nice video 's to watch when you finally clock the game . It just shows a quick shot of the ships flying away and then the credits roll ... it would be nice to have had a video type of thing like all through the game.Apart from that , this game rocked.. my the Shwartz be with you .	1
When the N64 system first kicked off , one of its first titles was `` Star Wars : Shadows of the Empire '' . `` Shadows ... '' was a very entertaining version of novel it was based on . It had challenging , yet rewarding , levels and overall solid gameplay . However , it had two marks against it . The first was that graphics had not fully realized the potential of the N64 and resembled SuperNES games on certain boards . The second is that , except for the sheer enjoyment of the playing the game again , `` Shadows ... '' lacks any real replay value . The introduction of `` Star Wars : Rogue Squadron '' ( based on a series of very successful novels ) to the N64 environment corrected these problems and set a whole new standard for action/adventure games on ANY platform . `` Rogue Squadron '' focuses on the missions of the famed Rogue Squadron , thought to be the most dangerous and lethal fighter pilot unit in the entire galaxy . Led by the legendary Wedge Antilles , the squadron fights 16 regular missions ( and 3 bonus missions ) ranging from defending the homestead on the deserts of Tatooine to rescuing prisoners from the spice mines of Kessel to battling the terrifying 'World Devastators ' on Mon Calamari . That just barely scratches the surface of the exotic locales where missions take place . The graphic environment is much more advanced this time around . No more static matte backgrounds . Everything is fluid and moves with the player . The gameplay has also been enhanced . Greater control is afforded to the joystick button on the control pad when it comes to manipulating the ships . Overall , it makes for a spectacular gaming experience . `` Rogue Squadron '' also adds a new twist that dramatically enhances its replay ability . It awards medals ( bronze , silver , gold ) for defeating a level with increasing degrees of efficiency . Achieving all of a certain kind of medal on all the regular missions also unlocks bonus missions . This creates a greater challenge and a greater sense of accomplishment once the challenge has been met.There is only one minor quibble about `` Rogue Squadron '' . In the game designers ' quest to make a very demanding game , they make some of the levels almost too hard to defeat even with the highest level of skill . The most glaring example of this is the level 'Raid on Sullust ' . Flying as a ( supposedly ) heavily armored Y-Wing , one is supposed to be able to fly skillfully and defeat the mission . However , the board is heavily populated with missile turrets that defend each of the 12-15 targets that must be hit . With skillful flying , it may be possible to knockout 3 or 4 of those targets and corresponding guns and turrets before dying , but on the life , it 's likely the next ship could be destroyed in less than 10 seconds . With only 3 ships per mission , it 's impossible to defeat that mission without using the 'unlimited lives ' cheat code ( which will NOT be revealed here ) . However , there 's no shame in using that code , and it is necessary if one intends to achieve the silver or gold medals . So , it 's a minor annoyance . `` Rogue Squadron '' raised the bar to an exceptionally high level for action/adventure games that other platforms have repeatedly shown a failure to meet . Nintendo still gets it , though , as it followed this game with the even more successful `` Rogue Leader '' for GameCube . `` Rogue Squadron '' is a must have for any serious gamer 's library .	1
If I had to pick one word to describe this game it would be amazing . & quot ; Rogue Squadron & quot ; pushes the N64 to it 's maximum power graphically , which can be further enhanced by an expansion pack ( I strongly recommend going with one it makes the game run smoother ) . The gameplay could n't be more entertaining , I often wonder how my little Nintendo 64 is able to handle all that this game has to offer . The missions you fly in this game vary from escorting ground troops into combat all the way to launching full foward attacks on monstrous Imperial ships . The AI is pretty strong depending on the difficulty level , but when it comes to your own wingmen helping you out just forget it . Environments in this game are incredible for a Nintendo 64 game and I give the designers alot of credit for putting so much work into them . Ca n't get you 're hands on the new Rogue Squadron & quot ; Rogue Leader & quot ; for Gamecube ? Pick this up to satisfy youre urge , if you do own Rogue Leader or even do n't plan on getting it , pick this title up anyways for a hell of a gaming experience .	1
LucasArts has really outdone itself with this great N64 game . After Shadows of the Empire was released , it quickly became obvious that the best level in the game was the first level , where you are flying a Rebel Airspeeder during the Battle of Hoth . LA decided to make a whole game using a similar concept , and Rogue Squadron was born . You play as Luke Skywalker , leader of Rogue Squadron , a group of elite rebel pilots who roam the galaxy , making life difficult for the Empire and its minions . You play through 16 basic missions , which together form a loose plot chronicling the adventures of Rogue Squadron during the time between the destruction of the first Death Star and The Empire Strikes Back . The missions range from simple search-and-destroy missions , to escorting supply trains , to freeing rebel soldiers from Imperial prison facilities . Along the way , you must learn to handle a variety of rebel craft , from the X-Wing to the Airspeeder . Each craft has its own strengths and weaknesses , plus each craft has a special weapon , which means that you are required to use each craft on certain missions . After you complete each mission , you may be awarded a bronze , silver , or gold medal based on your performance . After completing a mission , you can move on to the next one , or else go back and try again to get a better score . The game gives you a score summary after each mission , so you know right away which areaas you need to improve upon to get the gold.The look and feel of the game is excellent . The graphics are superb , and the Expansion Pak boosts them to cinematic levels . The sound is also excellent for a non-CD game , although the chatter from your squadron mates does get a little repetitive . The game is contained within a 3D environment , giving the game a flight simulator-like feel . The controls are pretty easy to get used to , though this DOES take a little practice . Fortunately , the first couple of missions are pretty easy , so you get a good chance to get familiar with the controls . The controls are the same for each ship , so you do n't have to switch back and forth.As stated before , the first couple of missions are pretty simple and easy . But , starting with about the fourth mission , they start to get REALLY tough , with multitudes of TIE fighters , missile turrets , and gun emplacements all doing their best to shoot you down . Expect to die many times before mastering each mission . Getting the gold medal on all 16 missions will definitely take a while.The game has a lot of nice bonus features as well . As you complete missions and earn higher medals , three bonus missions will appear , plus you will gain access to new ships , including the Millenium Falcon and a captured Imperial TIE Interceptor . There is also a passcode screen , allowing you to enter codes to unlock all sorts of interesting options , including a fourth bonus level and the Naboo Starfighter . There is even a code to allow you to fly a Buick sedan against the Empire ! The codes themselves are pretty easy to get . There are several sites on the Internet that have them.It 's easy to get immersed in the 3D environment of this game . Many 's the time I 've found myself leaning over to the left or right as I put my X-Wing through a tight turn . For those who like flight simulator-type games , I would say that this is the best FS game on the N64 . It 's a bit dated now , what with the impending release of Rogue Squadron II for the GameCube , but for those N64 fans out there , this one is a must-have .	1
The first Zelda game for the 64 , The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of time won game of the year for 1999 . As Link , your quest to save the tri-force from the evil Ganondorf will take you all over Hyrule , not only in the present , but also the future with the help of the Ocarina of time . If you like the Zelda series , this game is definently for you ( or even if you just like to save the world in your spare time : ] )	1
I love this game . I love this game . I love this game . I just got Ocarina of Time and it 's been a few years since it has come out - it still rocks even in comparison to what 's out now . I 've had a Playstation 2 for a couple of years and have had a good game here and there , but after playing Ocarina of Time , I realize that I had forgotten the beauty of Nintendo games . They just have a special feel to them ( and they make me remember the years that I was a little tike playing old Nintendo games ) . I just beat the game about 5 minutes ago . I certainly wo n't spoil anything , but I will tell you that the ending is over 30 seconds long and is something worth playing through the game to see ... A video game has n't brought me this level of satisfaction in a while . Bravo Nintendo , bravo .	1
I just bought this game a few weeks ago , and it 's awesome . It just has that `` This is going to be an epic game '' from the get go . It has great graphics , even to this day.First of all , this is an Action Adventure , not a RPG/Role Playing Game.Next , I recommend buying the Strategy Guide . This game is what gamers call `` Nintendo Hard '' . It 's a challenging game , with quite a number of puzzle parts.Anyway , buy it if you have a 64 , or Virtual Console it if you have a Wii .	1
This game is blew me away ! I did n't expect Ocarina to meet with my standards after playing the previous Zelda games . They usually go stale and predictable , but Ocarina did n't do that . It 's a game for true fans of the adventure genre ! The dungeons are long and perilous , there are numerous side-quests , a great cast of characters , and a large world to travel ! If you have any doubts about this game , eliminate them . You wo n't be dissapointed !	1
This could be the best game of all time . What else needs to be said ? If you have n't played this game before and still have a working N64 you need to pickup this game . If you have n't played the game you can also find it on the Wii Virtual Console and an upcoming remake for 3DS .	1
I 'm what gamers call a `` Zelda Veteran '' , I 've played almost ALL of the Zelda games and managed to beat only one : this one . I love the Zelda games because they are challenging , different and fun to play.In this one , Link lives in a forest with the forest folk . Link is soon inside the Deku Tree to defeat the evil monsters that moved into the tree . After a battle with the queen spider , the Deku Tree sadly dies and tells Link to find Zelda , the Princess of Hyrule.Hyrule is a kingdom that 's always in trouble , and its up to Link to save the land from a terrible enemy . Link has the help of Navi , a fairy that gives you advice or tells you what you should do next.During his adventures , Link will learn spells , be swallowed by a huge fish , and saving the land from the evil Ganondorf . This game is a classic and worth the money .	1
For all those of you that have followed the lineage of Zelda from its early days on the classic 8-bit system , and onward to its SNES days with & quot ; A Link to the Past & quot ; ( great game ) , and loved every second of it , then you have to buy this game ! For those of you that have never played any other Zelda game , what are you waiting for ? Now is a great time to start.Ocarina of Time is amazing . All the elements of classic Zelda are there - dozens of powerful items and weapons , lots of secrets to find , at least 10 new 3D-rendered challenging dungeons , plenty of secrets and side-games , and something that all the other Zelda 's never had : a truly great story ! If you enjoyed & quot ; A Link to the Past & quot ; you will most certainly like this game as well . The story of Ocarina of Time involves going back and forth in time , between a happy peaceful Hyrule , and a dark evil one , much like ALTTP ; but do n't think this is a rip-off on its predecessor . The complex dungeons , challenging bosses , and deepening story lines will blow you away . The 3D element of the game also adds so much more that was never possible before . Even the music is catchy and well orchestrated . ( I actually downloaded the mp3 soundtrack online ! ) The gameplay is a little tough to get used to - afterall , you 've never played Zelda in 3D before - so you actually have to consider things sneaking up behind you , and flying overhead ! But once you get used to the controls and learn to use the & quot ; Z-Targeting & quot ; feature ( using the trigger button will solve just about any control problem you may encounter ) , the gameplay gets easier.The only thing that annoyed me was Navi , a little fairy that travels with Link throughout the game . She is always bugging you to give you painfully obvious information . I suppose she is a helpful guide for younger or more inexperienced players , but I found her annoying . But once you come to realize that Navi is an important aspect of the game 's control , you will let it slide.I would recommend this game to anyone who owns an N64 console , and even more so if you enjoyed SNES 's & quot ; A Link to the Past. & quot ; I ca n't wait to play the sequel when it comes out .	1
Really though , could an old , out dated game still be awesome 4 years later ? The answer is yes , because this game is just too good . It gives you a complete story on Hyrule and the Triforce , not to mention the best video game music ever ( especially the boss music ) . Being able to play as young link and adult link in two similar , yet in a way completely different worlds as one would find out sooner or later . The graphics are still , and when this was released , it was the best game graphicwise as well . The bosses are easy , yet in a way challenging , and the dungeons and temples are amazingly designed . However , there are two faults , one minor , one somewhat major.-Link is missing the strap on his frontside that holds his sword case thingy ! Well , it just kinda looks odd.-The & quot ; final boss & quot ; is far too easy ... but do n't be too sure of that ...	1
I 'm not really a fan of N64 . I 've always been more of a Playstation one fanatic , but Zelda is undoubtedly the best game that I have ever played . If you think that Final Fantasy is good , then Zelda will make all of the installments in final fantasy look like junk . There 's only a couple of games on the nintendo N64 console that of which I liked , and that was Gauntlet Legends , Super Mario , and Donkey Kong . But this game beats them all by a longshot.Then why did I give this game four stars instead of five ? The reason is because of the ... problems listed below.1 . This game is HARD . I do n't mean hard as in `` Challenging '' I 'm talkin ' about the whole you-possibly-will-never-ever-complete-the-game-without-a-strategy-guide hard . The type of frustration which can rack your nerves big time.2 . There are a couple of glitches in the game . Example : I dare you to cut a sign with your sword . Then play Zeldas lullaby with your ocerina of time . The piece of sign which you had just sliced and diced will float . That 's just one of the glitches.3 . A little confusing , as far as the story goes . It 's better to play the game twice and see if you still understand it.4 . Replay value is n't very high . Once you complete it , that 's it . It 's so hard that I would n't ever want to go through the same frustration again , as to the fact that it was very difficult , even if you do know what you 're doing.Okay , those were the bads . Here are the goods.1 . The graphics are outstanding . Wow . The whole world of Termina reminds me of middle earth , only a lot less dark and ten times more exotic.2 . Once you beat the game , you feel satisfied with yourself . Sure , this game is a little short , but it will still take you a long time to beat it , no matter how experienced you are with gaming.3 . The plot is good and twists a lot . I know that I said it was kind of confusing , and it kind of is , but it 's still fun and the things that of which I did understood surprised me a lot.It 's sort of a mystery.4 . Fluint and absolutely excellent cut and FMW sequences . It 's true . Like I said above , the graphics are wonderful . And plus , exploring a small portion of Termina , which you do through out the game , is an experience that you do n't wan na miss.5 . The bad guys are challenging , but not so challenging that you 'll be ripping your hair out . Once you beat them , you feel satisfied.6 . Highly addictive gameplay and plus you wo n't stop until you beat the game.But there 's one major , and I mean MAJOR problem with this game . This game is so addictiive that you might forget about everything else in life . Remember your family ? You wo n't when you get this game , since you'l be wanting to play this game even more . A Anyways , get the game .	1
Before I played this game , the only other Zelda game that I had ever played was Link to the Past , and I could n't understand it that well . I decided to play this because of the hype . I was sure glad I did . This is one of the best games ever ! It 's full of adventure , it has a wonderful story , and it is challenging . It begins with Link , a 10-year-old Kokiri ( child of the forest ) who is chosen to save Hyrule , his home world . Along the way , you meet new friends , such as Princess Zelda , and grow into a 17-year-old adult to fight the evil Ganondorf ! You have many different weapons , spells , and items at your disposal , including swords , bows , and a giant hammer . The fun never stops and the story never goes flat . If you want a grand adventure , buy this game . If you like this , play The Legend Of Zelda : Majora 's Mask , but wait until you finish this game .	1
Very fun game to play , and has an excellent story line to play . Lots of different equipment to use , and the game is n't overly difficult to beat .	1
I 'll make it short ... I hope.I 'm not particular a fantasy lover , I never read Tolkien 's Lord of the Ring , I hate the Lord of the ring-movies and was insulted by the numerous Oscars the film ( s ) received.I despise the Star Wars movies , especially The Return of the Jedi , which has that peculiar fantasy-feel in it.Blahdieblahblah.Now , with games it 's a different story , I do n't know why , but I 'm much more forgiving and willing to accept a world where fairies , gnomes and other creatures excist.The Ocarina of time is one of few artistic highlights I encountered in my life ... it 's almost ridiculous when I think about what I 've just wrote , what about literature , art and cinema ? This game moved me so much ... am I a geek ? ... there 's so much depth in this piece of ... art.It is n't the story ( alone ) , c'mon let 's be honest , it 's an average fantasy tale , if made into a movie I 'd fall asleep after 10 minutes.I think it 's all the pieces put together : a beautiful crafted world , the progress when playing - from a child into a young man - , the challenges you 'll face and overcome , the music that playes a big role in the game , the use of time : day and night , future and past etc . etc.It grabs you and most important : it 's interactive ( duh ) for it 's a game , you 're not watching a crap fantasy movie , but playing the hero all by yourself , when he looses , you loose etc.I played a lot of games in my life , including many new ( er ) titles as Halo , GTA , Metroid Prime etc etc and I did n't yet played a game that matched the sheer brilliance of The Legend of Zelda - The Ocarina Of Time.Best game ever ( so far ) .	1
I was worried about getting this but I did anyways because I have been after it for a long time . I was worried because it was Used-Acceptable but it has played great so far ( though I have n't gotten very far yet ) So so far I am so glad I went ahead and ordered it .	1
I have played all the other Zelda Series Games and this is the best . I first heard of this game when I borrowed it from a friend . I played it nonstop , until I beat the game . The only hard part about it is the dreaded Water Temple . It is the only actual hard one , but do n't get me wrong the rest of the dungeons are equally difficult . Even the first level is as difficult because you have only your sword , shield and wits . But as you progress you gain pieces of hearts , weapons , swords , shields , and other tools . The graphics are really cool , the sound could be just a tad better , and the fun is the best . The only bad part is you ca n't unfreeze Zora 's Domain and get the Triforce , or Miyamoto says . Well if you liked the other Zelda games , this is a must have . If you never have played a Zelda game get a life !	1
I was always a fan of Zelda when it first came out for the original Nintendo . This is a fairly challenging game and I got bored with it quickly . There is n't a lot of violence in this game but I think it 's too advanced for kids to play .	1
Quite possibly , if you do n't know why then you have n't played many videogames ; - )	1
In its tenure , the N64 had its share of bad games . With exceptions like Super Mario 64 , the THQ wrestling games and a few others , it seemed like the bad outweighed the good . But with 'Ocarina of Time ' , the balance took a drastic shift as n64 was given its best overall game . 'Ocarina of TIme ' has many strong points for itself . For one , the player is given a very challenging and extremely satisfying quest to undertake . The game plays across a vast world with different subsections , each with their own particular themes . The gameplay is easy to get used to and becomes second nature as you play through the game . Graphics and sounds are done extremely well , considering the cartridge space allowed.There is not much to complain about , as this game really showed players what the N64 was capable of . It 's unfortunate that other game publishers did n't work this hard . But then again , & quot ; Ocarina & quot ; is a tough act to follow .	1
This is one of the best and my personal favorites from the Zelda franchise ! The story was fantastic , the gameplay was amazing for the time , even compared to todays gaming this game showed less problems or glitches.There was hardly any serious problems with this game . The playtime was a very good length and it offered a some side quests to do . Each dungeon was well constructed and were not something you walk in and leave unhappy . Some parts were frustrating sure but when is a game just so easy and you feel happy beating it ? Puzzles in this game were I suppose challenging for child but they were not impossible . This is a great game for all ages and a great buy as well .	1
This game is defently one of my top favorite games ! I dont have it but i 've rented it and it is cool . Your constantly under presure and near the end it feels like theres no where to go ! In this game you shoot arrows , fight theifs , get a horse , venture in caves and much more challenges like deafeating the power hungry sorcerer Gannondorf ! deffently 5 stars . Im planing on buying this game today .	1
This Zelda game is simply amazing ! The Wind Waker sucked and Four Swords was OK , but this game rocks ! The main plot was spectacular and the gameplay was great ! I first played the game after getting Collector 's Edition for Christmas , and I was addicted to it . The main plot throughout the whole game is that Link ( as a kid ) must collect 3 Spiritual stones and open the Door of Time , along with the Ocarina of Time . As an adult , Link must awaken the 5 sages and fight to destroy the evil Ganondorf and rescue Zelda . I have beaten the game 6 times it was so good ! I highly recommend it to big Zelda fans . NOTE : This game has a sequel called Majora 's Mask , but it 's not near as good in my opinion .	1
What else is there to say ? This is the best game I have every played . Totally worth a replay . The game was in great condition and got to me quickly .	1
THE BEST N64 GAME . It 's easy , difficult to totally master , and is fun to play again and again . The bosses are creative and original , and the dungeons are fun and easy . Storyline is pretty good , better than the & quot ; save the princess & quot ; generalization it 's often given . The characters are a quiet hero of time , an eternally youthful forest girl , a wild rock man from the firey Death Mountain , a rebellious fish woman , a determined royal guard , a sexy thief , the & quot ; princess & quot ; , and of coure , Ganon the bad guy .	1
Love this game . Although the graphics are n't the best since it 's N64 and earlier on ... . I enjoy everything about it ( still keeping in mind the limitations of the time such as the 'invisible walls ' and oddly prism shaped bottles etc ) . The story is well done and unlike other Zelda games , all of the items are used . There were some early on copies with a song/chanting in the fire temple that got taken out in later copies because some people got offended by that and the mirror shield ( I have one such copy ) but even with that in mind , it 's still an amazing game with great music and it sort of ties all of the zelda games together like a central hub . It all comes down to this game ... . definitely worth your time to play .	1
What can I possibly say about this game that has n't been said a million times.Perfection.Groundbreaking.Beautiful.Just some of the words that come to mind when I think of Zelda 64.Zelda was my introduction to RPG 's and what an introduction it was.The good.Everything.Graphics , story , pacing , etc ... Insanely difficult in parts , I still ca n't beat the water temple without the walk through.And Ganon in the painting still has to be one of the coolest boss battles of all time.The bad ? Nothing.One of the games that not only defined the N64 but a game that set the standard for excellence in RPG's.One of the best ... ever.Highest recommendations .	1
What can I say about this game ? I bought it to replace one that was stolen when I was a kid . It 's great to hear those classic sound effects and that legendary music . EPIC .	1
This game is the best game on my n64 next to nightmare creatures , this game feels like final fantasy , with Kingdom hearts it was the best selling game on the n64 . If you still have one you should pick this one up .	1
It 's ocarina of time . I just wanted to get it for my fiancee for christmas because she loves the game .	1
What can be said about Ocarina of Time ? I still remember that commercial from the late 90s . It told us that a `` dark time is approaching . '' My interest was piqued . Then I realized it was a Zelda game . As a huge fan of A Link to the Past , I thought `` ZOMG that looks awesome ! I need to get this more than I 've ever needed to get anything ! '' I remember reading about it in GamePro and obviously being interested , but that commercial sealed the deal . I knew I had to have Ocarina of Time , and that Christmas , my mom got it for me . Cheers ! A lot has been said about OoT over the years . It has been referred to as the `` Best Game of All Time '' by some , and the `` Most Overrated Game of All Time '' by others . I 'm not really in either camp , but I lean closer to the former group , I suppose . If you have n't played it yet , you should . It 's out on a variety of platforms and there 's even remake of it with better graphics , but I would still recommend the N64 version if you want the same experience people had back in the 90s when OoT was THE GAME you needed to play.Story : You are Link . The Great Deku Tree , guardian of the forest in which you live , has summoned you . It 's revealed that you must visit a far off castle and meet a `` Princess of Destiny , '' and doing so brings you square into a struggle for the fate of Hyrule -- nay , the world -- itself.Gameplay : To complete your quest and save Hyrule , you must boldly enter into many dungeons which are filled with fierce skeletal warriors , human-sized spiders , horrible ghosts , and ... immobile venus fly traps ! Completing a dungeon gives you an item for the main quest , and completing all of the dungeons will allow you to face the final boss . There 's much more to it that , but I 'm trying not to spoil storyline specifics for those who have n't played it.Hyrule is a vast world . One of your in-game guides tells you that `` You can go wherever you want . '' That 's true , to a point . There 's a lot of exploration in Ocarina of Time . The game is always trying to point you toward a certain place , but whether or not you go there is often up to you . In an interactive world such as Hyrule , you can do many things . Why go see what 's on Death Mountain when you could pour water into all of the soil patches in Hyrule ? Or why go play the Shadow Temple -- which does not have any attractive Gerudo women -- when you could go to the Spirit Temple , which does ? The exploration is one of OoT 's best features , and it 's probably better than any Zelda which came after it.Controls : They work well enough . You do n't have the full on camera control that some of the later Zelda games give you , but personally , I never found it all that essential to the process.Ocarina of Time introduced a `` Z-targeting system '' for aiming at enemies and talking to non-playable characters . What you do is get near an enemy/NPC , press or hold Z , and then press a button to talk to them/attack them . The system pretty intuitive and well made , so much so that its successors have yet to really improve upon it.Music : *90s gripe* Where is the classic Zelda overworld theme ? Oh , we can hear it for like five seconds in the Hyrule Field theme ? ARE YOU SERIOUS ? But seriously , the music is pretty good . The Hyrule Field theme which I just mentioned is a good theme . The music does a good job of fitting the areas which you visit , for the most part.Some later Zelda games use too much ambient music in the dungeons . OoT is guilty of this too , but only to a small degree . Apart from the Water Temple 's melody , there 's nothing that makes me want to relax and do some meditation or whatever while hearing it . : POh , and I 'm sad to report that the `` OoT Commercial Music '' is not in this game ... : ( Replay Value : It 's pretty massive . You can do some Temples in different orders than you did your first time through , or you can use different items to progress through the Temples . I summed it up in a sentence , but there 's hundreds of hours of replay potential there in just finding all of OoT 's possible variations.Like in the original Legend of Zelda , you can do the `` Three Heart Challenge , '' which means you can complete the game without any of the health upgrades from beating a dungeon . Essentially , that 's playing Hard Mode ( although it is n't really that hard ) .But if the Three Heart Challenge was n't enough , OoT lets you tack on additional stipulations to make replaying it even harder ! There are technically unnecessary items which let you breathe underwater and resist intense heat . Not getting them limits the amount of time you can spend in relevant areas . On top of all that , you could even as far to skip the health upgrades which halve your damage.______If you call yourself a gamer and have not played Ocarina of Time , what are you ? Some undercover non-gamer sent in to infiltrate us ! ? Go play it now !	1
There is n't much you can say that is bad with this game . For it 's time it had excellent graphics , excellent game play and sound . This game is truly one in a million that I am sure any person can enjoy , BUT , if your a Zelda fan ( and have played all if not most games from the beginning ) you 'll notice some of the things in OOT are recycled . For example , the Kakariko town music is completely recycled from Zelda : A Link to the Past . In fact this game borrows a lot from Zelda : A Link to the Past , though they do manage to change some things in OOT here and there . Still for what it 's worth Zelda : OOT is still a pretty darn good game , though I think the story should have been more original .	1
this is a game that is perfect it is so fun to play at times when the sun gos down u can do a lot of stuff in this game its very cool its got 20 hole hours of this game there are good ponits in this game very nice game GREAT MUSIC better then zelda 2 for the n64 this game has much more to have even if u think u have gotton all moneys and more u have much more for this game it is a must have n64 game lovers u will want this MASTER GAME for your system .	1
was a good purchase dont get me wrong . but i had a minor problem with it saving . at first it wouldnt save for the first 3 or 4 times . but eventually it did . other than that it worked great . awesome condition . came as described .	1
One of the best video games ever.Redefined everything after it.My copy came in very good condition without scratches or writing	1
The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of time is the best zelda game there is ! You go from being a kid , to being an adult ! Link must beat five temples as an adult , the forest temple , the fire temple , the water temple , the shadow temple , and the spirit temple . The bosses are awsome , and all the characters are cool !	1
Reading magazines from 1996-1998 one thing you could n't escape was a some kind of mention of Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time . It was all over the place . Popping this in my N64 when I took it home I spent literally 2 hours just exploring Kokiri Village just cause it was so fun . But then I realized & quot ; oh yeah there 's more to this , is n't there ? & quot ; And that 's when the fun started.Graphics : Although you can probably debate this , this has one of the best graphics you 'll find on the system . Lot of areas just drop that & quot ; wow factor & quot ; , like when you first enter Zora 's Domain or the game 's many cutscenes.Sound : Although there 's no voice , except for Navi 's annoying & quot ; Hey ! & quot ; and an occasional & quot ; Hello & quot ; from her or Link 's grunts , it 's got some awesome music . One thing I love is the short ocarina songs you play , such as Song of Storms , Zelda 's Lullaby and Song of Time , plus general area music . Although the overworld music is n't like what it was on Link to the Past , it 's still great.Story : The story starts off with Link having a bad dream about a mysterious man and woman . Then Link is summoned to the Great Deku Tree where he fills Link in on his quest and it goes from there . Even though it can be a quite simple story , it 's just a huge epic story that kept me interested.Gameplay : The infamous Z-Targeting system that 's spawned several developers to use it in their own games . The recent Star Fox Adventures uses this . Your C-Buttons are for your weapons . B is your sword and A is your action button ( Talk , Jump , Climb , etc. ) . You 'll know this system by heart cause Navi tells you how many times about it within the first hour . Camera is excellent and the Z targeting helps.Even though you might be able to find this , I suggest you pick it up . Dust off your N64 and dive into what is one of the 90 's most critically acclaimed and commercial masterpieces ever .	1
This is by far the best Zelda installment yet . Much more fun than Majora 's Mask , mainly because you can freely explore the world of Hyrule . ( see review of Majora 's Mask ) This game can be fun for anyone .	1
I confess- i 've never played a single Zelda game before this- cause i was n't into RPG games , but i 'm so glad i never gave this a miss . One day , i just felt like playing this game and i bought it and it 's terrific , no maybe better than terrific , it 's too good to be true.I spent 4 good months playing this game and i finally beat it recently but that has n't stopped me from planning round 2 and buying the brady guidebook to find all the secrets.This game is also filled with charatcer interaction and drama . I think you can read Amazon 's review for the storyline and i 'll just encourage you to buy this game if you haven't.It 's a player 's choice game and coming from Nintendo- i am not surprised it 's this good . I 'm gon na get Majora 's mask when it comes out this winter and i hope to see this game on the Dolphin.If you are hooked and want to relive the magic- go get an old NES or SNES from your cousins or someone and buy the previous Zelda games and you 'll see why Zelda 's a classic.Like Mario , Zelda has a huge following and blah blah ... i do n't need to elaborate on the game 's success anymore.As far as fun/gameplay/story/graphics/sound/replay is concerned , it 's a safe bet to say that i will give every category at least 9.5 out of 10.I 'll only give it a 10 when they put in FMV and put to rest once and for all , that Zelda is the definitive standard-RPG and action-RPG and not Final Fantasy . Sorry guys , i had to say it- it 's true.Now if only Majora 's Mask would arrive sooner ... oh i ca n't wait !	1
The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is a definite Classic . I 've owned this game for a good 6 years and it 's just extraordinary and fun , but at the same time educational . In this game you must do alot of thinking and find out where the secrets are . So in other words , it 's a magical adventure game.The graphics are actually good ( for it 's time ) and the gameplay is easy to get used to . The controls are also simple and the whole storyline is just well thought out and I can definitely tell that they put alot of time into this game . In my opinion it 's the best Zelda game so far.Now I will tell you the beginning of the Story so you can even feel more excited about getting this game.As a young baby boy , your mother was killed by an evil person . Now you have no home and have to move to a place called the Kokiri Forest . This is a place where people never grow up and are n't allowed to leave the forest . They 're called the Kokiri . But you 're different . You really do n't belong in this forest , instead you belong out in a world called Hyrule . You 're a Hylian ( normal people who actually grow up ) . You 're out there to defeat Ganondorf . Ganondorf , most likely the person who killed your mother , is a strong and evil person who wants to take over Hyrule and become the King . The only person that can stop him is you ( Link ) . Now the question is , will you be able to defeat the mean and evil Ganondorf and save the world of Hyrule ? If you think ( or know ) you can take that responsibility , then I suggest that you buy this game along with the N64 ( if you do n't have one ) and experience something very special . Like I said , it 's a definite Classic and will keep you entertained for hours on end ! You wo n't regret it ! Thank you for reading and I hope I was helpful enough .	1
the game was awesome . Zelda has always been an addicting , mindblowing , and fun game . Many people like it . The game features a great 3d world in which there is night and day . the game also has many different enemies and dungeons and the famous ocarina where you can play different tunes that you have learned . A really good game if you like action and adventure . The frustrating thing are the puzzles . they may take some time to solve . This is not why i gave the game 4 stars . I believe 5 stars means the game is perfect . and this game is not perfect .	1
This is one of the best games I have ever played . Even shooting the arrows is fun , you can actually use your shield to block getting hit . Just incredible . The only bad thing I can possibly say is you almost have to buy the strategy guide or else you will likely get stuck on some levels . There are a few dungeons that I could not find my way out of without buying the guide . But overall great game ! !	1
Zelda : OOT is centered around a massive , circular field called Hyrule . Around this field are pathways which lead off to various different locations such as dungeons , castles , villages , volcanoes , etc ... Each path will lead to usually one destination like a castle , and once explored , you travel back across Hyrule field and visist another pathway which leads to a different location . This makes areas more accessible , and it makes backtracking as less tedius as possible , due to the fact that you 're not endessly travelling through pre-explored ares . Backtracking is an important feature of OOT , due to the fact that when you progress through the game you aquire objects which give you the ability to explore areas more thoroughly ... bombs for instance blow up walls that hide secret paths . Hockshots give you the ability to ascend to higher ledges . The Ocarina of Time opens secret doors . Thus , pre explored areas which you thought were unimportant can in fact conceal the most important instruments and dungeons in the game . This is compounded , when at one point in the game you aquire the Master Sword . This is a special sword which , upon claiming , makes you and the world age by seven years , and by doing the reverse , putting the sword back in it 's mold , makes you and the world 7 years younger . The good thing about this is that the past and future are profoundly different . The future is controlled by evil , whereas the past is controled by good . Needless to say , your mission in the game is to liberate peice by peice the future world from the evil Ganondolf . However , in order to do so you must travel back and forth in time creating situations which will have an impact on the future world.A main part of this game is the ocarina of time . Depending on what tune you play , the ocarina will turn night in to day , make it rain , open secret doors , or make blocks disappear , amoung other things . This adds an important layer to the game , for you have to use your brain in order to work out which song is necessary to progress . For instance , after spending hours wondering what to do , the idea could suddenly hit you , `` Should I play Zelda 's Lullaby in front of the waterfall ? '' If successful , the waterfall will stop and a passageway will display itself , thus giving you a tremendous satisfied feeling . The actual songs you learn in the game are some of the best songs in computer game history . In fact , only Computer World by Kraftswerk can compare to the greatness of the music in OOT.By the time Zelda : OOT was released the difficulty in games was just perfect . Your heart was racing when you met a worthy adversary , you were fustrated when you died , you were delighted when you succeeded . Fustration and anger are both necessary in games because it 's those feelings which make you truly delighted when you succeed ... Unfortunetly , since OOT , games have become so easy that a huge part of the joy in completeting them is n't there anymore .	1
I have to say this is the absolute best Legend of Zelda so far ... But there is one thing I have to clarify THIS IS NOT THE FIRST LEGEND OF ZELDA ! ! ! The first came out on the NES and is Great to play ... . This one has good control , fun plot , and will get you so wrapped up in it , you 'll come screaming back for more .	1
I got this on the GameCube Collector 's edition and really , it 's confusing how they DID N'T make this the best game of 2000 , 2001 , 2002 and 2003 . They DID make it the best game of 1998 and 1999 but anyways , there 's a master quest version out there for GameCube . The sites are beautiful . And when u get inside the Deku Tree , let the action/fantasy begin !	1
Whoever hates this game should be shot ! This is one of the greatest games ever ! It 's the best of Link ! GameSpot gave it a 10 ! Anyway , enough prasing it . On to my review ... Graphics : 10/10 : Looks really good for the time . Big , vast valleys , long mountains , clear water , beautiful guts of Jabu-Jabu ... Sound : 10/10 : Clash ! AHHH ! HAHA ! HIYA ! Beautiful Ocarina sounds ! BOOMM ! Music 11/10 : Beautiful music . Ocarina songs are deep and moving . Composed beautifully.Gameplay : Infinity/10 Awesome ! Go through many dungeons filled with tough enimies and hard puzzles ! Talk to people in town ! Play many , minigames ! Stealth ! This is extremely fun and addictive ! Hidden items . You can also find 99 Gold Skullutas ! Play an Ocarina ! Controls are flawless ! One of the greatest games of all time . Do n't play it-live it ! PS . Why has Amazon combined OOT and MM into one ? It 's confusing , and it 's depleting the rating ! Also , Gerry Atrick , the reviewer above me , was that troll review even nesscery ? You said to contact you if anybody knew how to get out of the Deku Tree . Well , 1 : Look on a gaming site and 2 : How can anybody contact you if they do n't know your address . And NO , there is n't a cheat to make Link naked . It 's E-rated ! Ah well , whaddya expect from a guy from Ireland ...	1
Zelda & quot ; occarina of time & quot ; is much like the rest of the Zelda series ... it does n't disappoint ! With really cool items to collect and using your songs/spells to warp around , the entire game offers whole new dimensions.Things such as a horse you can call and run about the world , play carnival-like games to win power-ups , collect hard-to-find items such as the two-handed sword ( which is better than the master sword , but you ca n't use a shield ) , magically powered arrows , and more ! This game is fairly easy to beat , but finding everything will take you much longer !	1
You must own this if you like games . It 's spectacular in every way , perfect . It creates a breathing world you care about and love , while having this awesome , deep story and Adventure .	1
This game has crossed the `` I Like You '' line . It 's just like the old one from NES , although , I know about the dungeons and the weapons because I have the old one . So , it 's fun to play for a while until you get to the Water Temple , it gets confusing there . So , use the Player 's Guide to cheat , so that you wo n't get stuck . I played a long time ever since it came out . It was the game that caught my eye and though I had to have the game . I am a Zelda fan and I hope that you have fun playing it as well . I just like to see Link grow up .	1
The most recent LoZ games , in my opinion , have all been fairly average . Wind Waker was the latest actually good LoZ game . But of all the LoZ games , OoT is just plain incredible.In this game , you play as Link as he grows from a child into a young man while on his quest to defeat Ganon and save the world from ultimate , evil rule . Along the way , you meet many friends and face amazing boss battles.The graphics ( at the time ) were just incredible . It really made me enjoy looking at and playing the game . Nintendo really did a great job in this department.The gameplay is like no other . One of the few incredible games to utilize the C Buttons for vital controls , this game felt really comfortable to play , and there 's tons to do in the game besides just beating it . Also , throughout the game , you are forced to travel back and forth through time and play as Young or Adult Link to complete the game , which is awe-inspiring in my opinion . Sadly , after doing little everything , there 's no addictive mini-games to really play and not much else to do , but go through the game again and again.The sound is incredible , and the music has never been better . I found myself turning the volume on the TV all the way up while playing this game , because the sound was that good ! If you 're an avid gamer , yet you 've never played this game , then something 's really wrong with you . Pick this game up and play it 'till your fingers fall off ( which I guarantee you 'll do ) . This game is worth buying and owning for as long as you even are alive .	1
The best game for the N64 . if you are to have 5 games for the system it needs to be Mario 64 , Mario Kart , Smash Bros , Banjo Kazooie , and Zelda	1
this game is a real gem , treasure it and treat it well it is worth any price	1
Wow ... What can I say . As I 'm writing this review , the popular consoles right now are ps2 , gamecube , and xbox . I have all of those . Yet no game on any of those systems are better than this . This is probably the best zelda ever ( I have yet to buy the one for gamecube ) . Deciding between this and Majora 's mask is a tough call , but I think this one gives a little more gametime.How should I begin to describe this game ? It 's deep , engrossing , and the graphics are spetacular for a N64 . Yes the newer games right now definitely have better graphics than this , but this game beats all of them in terms of gameplay , music , and theme . The story is old , but hey , it 's a classic formula . Why change it ? What would Zelda be without dungeons ? This is one of the few 3rd person games I 've played with great controls . The z-targeting system can change a traveling mode Link instantly to a combat alert , and maneuverable Link . The music fits the moods perfectly , from the dark shadow temple to the light and cheery music of the lost woods , it 's great . Buy it , it 's worth your money , and it 's probably the best game ever for N64 .	1
The legend of Zelda has always been a series that continually delivers amazing games that are at the top of their class . The legend of Zelda has always been my favorite video game series of all time since I was little and their games continually suck away hours of my life . This is the game that made me truly love gaming ( Before I just did it for fun ) . It also set the stage for other great games such as majoras mask , wind waker , and twilight princess.Gameplay : If you have played any of the other Zelda games , you will know that you play as Link , a young Kokiry boy who must go out on the adventure of a lifetime to defeat the evil Ganondorf and save Princess Zelda . The controls are flawless . You just move the analog stick to make Link move , move forward and press A to roll , press B to use your sword , the C buttons are home to you other weapons such as the bow , hookshot , and the like . This game introduced the revolutionary lock on system where you just pressed Z , and staid locked on to an enemy , which meant no more aimless sword swinging , it realy made the combat more managable , and much more fun , Like any Zelda game there is a huge overworld to explore . You have grassy plains , tall volcanic mountains , serene lakes , sandy deserts , difeerent towns and villages , and lots to do . The overworld is just enourmes , esspecially for an N64 game . Hyrule feild stretches in all directions . One of the great things about traveling is part way through the game , you will get a trusty horse named Epona . Riding around hyrule feild is just realy addicting . There are many great minigames to do as well , such as the shooting gallery , bombochu bowling , selling mask , and fishing , yes fishing . There are also special task to do such as collecting ten special poes ( Huge ghost that appear in hyrule feild ) , or collecting 100 Skulltullas ( Spiders of a horrible curse ) . The meat and Potatoes is of course the dungeons . Each dungeon is completley uniqe and different than the last one and shows off alot of great elements . There are many challenging puzzles that reward you when you figure them out . You raise and lower water , look for paths that are invisible with the lens of trooth , push giant blocks with the silver gauntlets , use the megaton hammer to push blocks , and much much more . Each dungeon is just very well crafted that it is hard to beleive that it came out in 1998 . There are many feirce enemies in each dungeon that fight to put an end to your quest such as Stalfos , bats , lizolfos , armos , iron knuckles , jellyfish , tektikes , readeds , skulltullas , and so many more . The boss battles are each intricitley desighned and completely different than thre last in the way they look and fight . The boss battle with Ganon at the end is one of my all time favorite final battles ever ( only rivald by the fight in twilight princess , and Mother brain ) . The difficulty is always just right with the challenges and enemys getting toupher as you go on . Through the game you get alot of fantastic weapons to use , such as a bow , hookshot , megaton hammer , hovor boots , silver gauntlets , boomerangs , and much more . Each is always put to good use and none of them ever go absolete and are awlays usefull the whole way through One of the big mechanics is of course the ocarina itself , you play it manually with the button layout being like the holes in the real thing . You can change day into night , transport across the world map , and open passage ways with you trusty instrument , and much more . The biggest suprise is after you get the Master sword and travel forard in time seven years . Time travel is a huge element in this game as some things you do as a child will effect the things you do as an adult , and vice versa . there are also different things avalible to do in each time and it is a blast to go between two time periods and it realy makes you feel powerfull . Nore matter which aspect of the gameplay I am talking about , I can not find fault anywhere , absolutely perfect.Story : Hyrule was created by din Nyrule , and Farore , they left behinf the triforce which lies in the Sacerd realm . Many years later , an Evil Man named Ganondorf seeks the triforce and Places a curse on the deku tree , and does other horible things to many races . The deku tree tells navi , the fairy that she must awaken Link as he has been having a nightmare about the evil man . Link goes to get a sword and Sheild , and goes to see the great Deku tree who asks him to rid the curse . Link succeeds but finds out that he is far to late . Before dying , the Deku tree tells him the legond of the triforce and gives him the spirituall stone of the forest , the Kokirys emerald , and then tells him to go to hyrule castle to meet nPrincess Zelda . Link goes to hyrule castle , meets princess Zelda Who tells him of the dreams she has been having about Ganondorf and Ask Link to get the other two stones , Link obliges and gets them but finds that it is to late As princess Zelda and Impa flee hyrule catsle , Zelda throws him the Ocarina of time . Link then comes face to face with Ganondorf and gets a taste of his power . Zelda then Telapethacally teaches him the song of time . Link goes to the Temple of Time and Plays it at the alter where the stones are placed and opens the secret chamber where he finds the Master Sword . Link being the legendary hero , takes the master sword , but finds that he has fallen into Ganondorfs trap . He is then seald in time for seven years where he is awakened by the sage of light Rareu . Link discovers that he is now an Adult . and instructs him to find and awaken the other sages . This is where the game gets epic , but I wont spoil anymore fore , suffice it to say it is a great story that is very well told and will keep you wanting to find out what happens next.Graphics : These graphics were truly groundbraking and ahead of their time back in 1998 . The moment you step out into hyrule feild and se the scale and distance you will be mesmerized . The game shows off some fantastic day and night sequences as well as many different colors . Hyrule market looks and feels alive , the kakariko village will look like a town with houses and shops . The desert esspecially is arguablly the best way to show off the N64s power with snadstorms and wind effects . The Charecter models are great for Lnik , to Zelda , To Ganondorf , to the bosses , to even the NPCs . The enemys realy look feirce and different . These graphics truly set the standerd in 1998.Sound : The sound effects themselves are Spectacular like the flowing water , the clank of a sword hitting a wall or an enemy , the enemy sounds when thay are struck bu the sword or when they are attacking , Lniks yelps , and much more . The game features a brilliant musicalll score , Koji kondos work is reminiscent of John williams almost , and that is not a comparison I make lightly . You will hum the beat of the lost woods , love the powerfull melody of the temple of time , be entranced by the song of storms , there is just so many great melodys that I have lost count . The song of time is truly memorable as well as all of the others . My only complaint might be the lack of the traditional overworld thing and Navis annoying hey listen screams , but these are all tossed aside once you hear Koji Kondos work at its finest with the lost woods theme and song of time.Replay Value : I still play this game nonstop . It truly proves that Amazing agameplay oulives any other aspect of a game . There is just so much to do and so much to see and so many places to explore that you will never want to drop the conntroller.This game is My favorite game of all time and is a must buy for any N64 owner , or enouph of a reason to get one if you do not have one already . It is also avalible on the Wii vertuall console and is well worth the download . This is the game of my Childhood and I cannont stress enoph how much you need to get this game .	1
I got this game a couple of years ago and I was completly shocked , it was really fun and addictive but takes you into a new world called Hyrule . Throughout the story , Link has to save Hyrule from Ganondorf who makes Hyrule look like the Devils mountain ! But , if Link collects the right items , he might save Hyrule with the Princess of Zelda.Graphics : 5/5 The colors really standed out with the houses , grassland , people etc ! Gameplay : 4/5 It was a challenging game , might be hard to follow through in controlling but Z-targeting helps you alot ! Using new weapons such as swords , sheilds , bow n arrow , hookshot , etc was usfull in beating.Storyline : 5/5 The story was copied by the old Zelda from Super Nintendo but made into a more better world . More places to explore , and more side quests to do ! Overall : 5/5 My opinon , I thought it was a game that everyone even Zelda fans should get it for your collection . Once you beat it , you can actually go for more side quests , items to get , and other things you missed .	1
A Good game comes along , entertaining millions of fans worldwide . Then , a year later another good game comes along and steals the fisrt ones place . Ever since the beginning of game history , every good game that came out eventually got replaced by a better game the next year . Since Sept. 98 , that cycle has been broken , stopped by one game that never got replaced , even by it 's sequals , nothing ever ended out better than Zelda : Ovarina of Time . This game has revolutionized 3D gaming with its Z-Target system . It has enchanted and bewildered people with its magnificant storyline . It has taken the lives of thousands of people because of all the side-quests and collectible items in it . This game , I am predicting , will probably still rain supreme until the next system comes out ( The one after gamecube ) . Its Z-Targeting system makes Link ( the main character ) look at an enemy , within this looking , he can circle around it in stategic patterns , accurately aim and strike the sword without missing and hitting air a yard away , and eaily and quickly dodge and backflip attacks . Many games , even nowadays , imitate this system , but fail to get it as correct and perfect as Zelda did/does . The storyline starts off telling of a magical forest with many never-growing children in it . All these children have one compainon fairy with them , except one boy , who does not . Right from hearing this setence in the game for the first time , you know your in for an adventurous , complicated yet slightly realistic storyline that will take your life for at least a month . And , this game has many , many side quests to do . There are 100 special spiders to defeat and get treasures with , 50 magic beans to be planted and give a passegeway to unaccesible areas , 25 heart pecies to collect to get a whole lot of health with , 15 masks to sell and play around with , 6 empty bottles to collect , a chicken to rais , and a huge trading sidequest that eventually leads to the possesion of the strongest weapon in the game . And much more . This game also has the perfect sound to it . The cheerfull , happy nature of the magical forest can be perfectly heard in it 's background music . The adventurous , wide and far meadows of hyrule feild are perfectly expressed in it 's background song . The fast-paced and action-packed lives of the desert theives is clearly expressed in it 's song . Everywhere you turn in this game , you are greeted with a new background song that sings perfectly the attributes and unique features of that place , and transations perfectly with whatever the player/link might be doing in that place . This game 's sequal , Majoras Mask , suffered horribly from the lack of this . And the prevous games in the series didnt meet this either . One more thing though , I 'll admit it to the world , I hate the main Zelda theme . I 'm glad its not in Ocarina of Time , In a game that so clearly stands out with it 's music , one old sounding , bland song that dosnt fir well with hyrule feild wouv'dv ruined the experience of going out of kokiri forest and seeing it for the first time . Oh , I forot to mention that part too , the game has a perfect attidude for adventure in it . The places are designed very well , and when mixed in with the fabulous background music , gives a feeling of adventure that is completely unparelled to any other game , whatsoever . The first moment you walk out of the small and cramped kokiri forest , which actually used to seem so big , onto the your first grasses of hyrule feild , the sun will blind the screen for a moment , and as rising , reveal this spectacular , wide open feild with a tuft of trees , a monstor here and there , a ranch in the middle , and a clear blue sky with a brightly shining sun . Along the feild , a rise in elevation starts , as you climb the hill , you can see even more than you could before , a magestic , huge catsle , a winding clear blue river , a deep valley , a menancing volcanoe , and a huge lake , along with a tuft of trees , and a monstor here and there . As you travel to new places , you will feel almost the exact same feeling of adventure too , when seeing the towering windmill of Kakariko village above the small , humble houses of the village below it , with the perfect backgrond music for example . With this great feeling of adventure , huge enviroments , much huger than even the ones of nowaday games , and a great storyline and absolutly stunning soundtrack , Ocarina of Time is the Greatest game of all time , until a greater game will come out , wich will probably take a very very long time . If you dont already own this game ( Shame on you ) , you should buy it immediatly , and while waiting for it to ship , download an emulated version . Now . Or else .	1
This game is just sickeningly good and nothing else since has matched it 's gameplay , depth , charm , design and atmosphere . It is absolutely flawless and perfect.When it came out 3 years or so ago i was hooked to it immediately and i finished it in about a month . But since then i finished it around 10 more times and i still enjoy playing the full game today after 3 years ! It is that good . The controls are absolutely perfect and the targeting system works perfectly for most combat situations.The atmospehere of the levels of the game is just the best ever in a game to date . For example in the mysterious forest the Lost Woods , u can actually feel it 's mystery from the excellent music getting louder as u reach it 's source and the way the whole place is designed.No videogame fan has an excuse not to play or own this . Words can not describe my love for this game . ( Sounds stup [ id but it 's true ) You will so nostalgic even when u meet the characters again for the 20th time . It is just a gaming masterpiece and i doubt it will be bettered for a veeeeerrryy long time to come unless the new gamecube zelda follows the same direction and improves it with a larger interface and new fresh ideas.BUY IT it or u will miss out on the best game ever . yes the best game ever.. all i can say is if u havent for some reason BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT ...	1
Zelda 64 is defenetly one of my favorite games for the N64 . It has a fairly good story , it 's interesting enough to make you want to know what happens next , and it has a gameplay that 's unbeatable . The combat system is very simple and great . You have your z locking on system which makes killing enemies a piece of cake . There is so much to do in this game that it 's comaprable to a good RPG , something that N64 has n't been blessed with yet . The graphics are pretty good , especially since they do n't use the expanssion pack , and the world is just huge . One down side is that some puzzles in the caves can be pretty tough , and sometimes , you may feel lost and do n't know what to do next . The bosses look very impressive and get more challenging as you progress through the game . This game will defently take a couple months to beat , unless you play 24/7 . After you master the game , then it 'll just take a couple of days , like any other normal , or great game . Nintendo has defenetly done a great job with this one . One thing I did n't like about it is that it has gotten eaiser than it 's predicessors . I 've started playing Zelda games since the SNES days . Back then , it was Zelda : A Link to the Past . The game was tough . I 'll admit it , it took me a year to beat that . That game was also HUGE . But now , 3D has made things eaiser , which I like and do n't like . But another thing I do n't like . They keep on changing the whole story of Zelda . Those of you who played the SNES game will know what I 'm talking about . There , Link did n't live in a forest , and there was n't a guardian fairy . And the whole world changed too . Well , maybe it 's for the best , but I would n't mind if they made a remake of it , maybe for the GBA ? ... ..	1
I came across this game in 1999 and immediately recognized it from the cartoon from back in the 80 's . I played it just to try it and I wound up getting so addicted I had to buy it for my N64 . I would stay up til all hours playing it . It 's rare for a game to hook me like that but this is one that is challenging yet fun so you ca n't help but say `` okay I'ma try one more time then I 'm turning it off '' and still be playing a couple of hours later.The Water Temple was the biggest pain for me because I tend to rush into things and would n't do things right as far as the puzzles went . I loved the Forest Temple as a kid . The weapons are easy to use and play a role in a fair share of what you do . The boomerang has a few uses such as getting items that are out of reach , hitting switches , and killing enemies . The ones I loved were bombs except when I got too close to them . lolI do n't remember much else about the game since it 's been a while since I had time to play it . I do know it took me quite a while before I managed to get some things such as all the Poes and Golden Skulltulas but no matter how many times I play this game it does n't lose its appeal . Like I said , it 's challenging but not so hard that you throw the controller down in frustration and give up.It 's the second easiest game of the three Zelda 's I 've played . Twilight Princess , although very in depth , was easy and Majora 's Mask was the hardest but only because I kept running out of time when doing certain tasks . Ganon was hard for me to kill at first but I think now that I 've played it enough and therefore fought him enough I know what to expect and I can now anticipate what he 's going to do and react accordingly.All in all , I recommend this game even if the system it was made for is pretty much a thing of the past .	1
This is a game you could fall in love with . When I first played it ( immediatly after it came out ) I was so engrossed and enchanted with it that it was like the real world disappeared and there was just me and the game . This never happened with me with a video game before . The scenery is breathtaking and some of the music scores are beautiful , although I think the music in the first forest dungeon as an adult is absolutely creepy ! The dungeons are puzzling at times but not too hard , and the bosses are challenging enough you may have to try them several times , but do n't worry you can eventually beat them . The game has a built in save feature so you do n't need a memory card and you can save anywhere in the game , do n't have to wait for any specific save point , that is real nice.You start out as a 10 year old boy and then after 3 levels you travel through time and become an adult . Hyrule has changed and you need to save the land . You go through many levels and bosses to finally get to Gannon , the ultimate evil here . He is an improvement on the previous Gannon of previous Zelda games ( looked like a little pig then ! ) and fighting him is more challenging and engrossing in this new game . There are other little side adventures thoughout the game to entertain you when you want a break from dungeons and monsters . This is a high quality game fun for kids and adults .	1
Wassup , fellow gamerz ! Nubs . Lulz.My parents just bought me `` The Legend of Zeldo : Collector 's Edition '' for my 14th birthday . It features this `` Legend of Zeldo : Oracana of Time '' game . I enjoyed this game very much ... even tho the graphics suck ! I will give you some of my thoughts now ! My favorite part was when the main character , Link , pulls the Supreme Sword from the stone in the iceberg temple . Oh man ! Glammondwarf ( the villain ) was so cool ! He snuck into the Secret Realm behind Link and stole the Trueforce of Strength ! ! Pwned ! The Prince Zeldo person was really weird . He/she was a tranny who turned into some guy named Shaieke , who kept stalking Link on his journey . Then he/she would change back into an elf girl in a dress . What a creep ! But Zeldo had the Trueforce of Smartness , so I guess that character was okay . Zeldo had this tall white-haired ninja lady named Inca as a bodyguard . Inca might have been a man too though ... I 'm not sure . She looked kinda like my aunt Helga.The Link character was really cool ! Link wears white tights , a green toga , and had a grappling hook device ! He also has this little firefly thing called Navely that follows him around ! You begin the game playing Link 's little kid brother , which kinda sucked . I ca n't pwn Goombas with a little midget ( Goombas are these big skeleton guys ) . I think the kid brother is supposed be Peter Pan , after he killed Captain Hook and left Neverland ( maybe they have another game about that part ) .But later you get to play Link , who is an adult elf with a pointy nose . He has the Trueforce of Braveness , so that means he is very brave . He can throw dynamites into walls to blow them up and reveal secret buried treasures ! I wonder if the treasures were hidden by magic pirates ? Later on , Link gets the Bassoon of Time and can play it to make it snow ! I think Link is kinda mentally handicapped though because he never talks . He just goes `` Ugh ! Hiyah ! AUGHHHHHH ! '' and stuff.I think he might be a cannibal ( or vampire ) too , because he eats hearts to gain health . There is a really annoying beeping sound that reminds you when it 's time to feed.You pick up these little colored diamond things called rublees that you can use to buy stuff with . But they look really big , so I wonder how Link can carry so many in his pockets ? And if you do n't pick the rublees up soon enough , they begin flashing and disappear ! I guess they 're like ... big holograms or something , like in Star Wars . Why are there so many rublees hidden in the grass and under rocks ? I really wish I could mow my parents lawn in real life and find money like that.There are these fish people named Zurros . They have this giant jellyfish named Mr. Jabba Jabba and you have to go into his stomach to retrieve an ugly little talking fish-man ! I think it was the Zurro king 's pet and he lost it . But you have to carry it all around Mr. Jabba Jabba 's stomach , so it 's kinda annoying.Then there are these big rock guys called Gordos that like to roll down mountains ! They are my favorites because they live in this mountain called Doom Mountain . It explodes like a volcano and tries to kill you ! Holy **** ! That evil Glammondwarf guy is a member of the Garundo thieves . They are a bunch of ginger women that live on a beach . But they do n't have any men in their race , so I do n't understand how there are so many Garundos ? Maybe some of them are trannies , like Zeldo . I think Glammondwarf might be one . He kinda sounds like a drag queen when he laughs.Sooooo all of these people live in this magical land called Hirole with a bunch of weird cartoon characters . I think it 's supposed to be kinda like Toon Town from Roger Rabbit . It 's such a huge place ! It takes forever to ride across it on Link 's horse , Ramona ! That 's right ! You get a horse ! Link steals it from Mario and Luigi at some ranch . So I guess Link is kinda a thief . Maybe he 's really one of those Garundo thieves ? He does kinda look like a girl . But he 's not a ginger , so I 'm not sure.Aaaanyway ... .play this Bassoon of Time game ! It is full of so much WIN ! I hope I did n't give too much of it away ! Lulz ! ! 11one XD-w00tkid95-	1
The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time is , simply put , the best adventure game I have ever played . I 'm a newcomeer to the Zelda series , so I 'm not too sure how Ocarina rates with the others , but I love it . For an Nintendo 64 , the graphics are absolutely beautiful . The lighting rivals that of a Playstation 2 or Xbox or Game Cube . The sound is terrific . Each different sound effect was done in detail . The sword against stone and the sword against wood are not the same as in a lot of games and sound just like they should . The echos when you enter the room and the monsters roaring in the distance are incredibly realistic and Link 's footsteps are done perfectly . The puzzles are challenging , but not so that you want to through the controller down in frustration but so that you wo n't put the controller down until you 've figured them out . The minigames and the sidequests will keep you playing long past the time you 've beaten the game itself because they are so plentiful . The controls take some getting used to but are perfect for the game 's combat system . The targeting especially helps the later you get into the game . The music is captivating and is very well done . Overall , I think this is one of the best games ever , not just in adventure . It 's definetly a game anybody with a Nintendo 64 should have .	1
WHat a game . I have played Zelda For Nes , Snes , and now the N64 A link to The past was a great game but this is the best Zelda game . The graphics are graet . Teh temples are huge . This is the best game for the N64 . Majoras mask is great too but this one is better . Sp i reccomend this game to everyone . It truly is one of N64 's best . Ca n't wait to see Zelda on Gamecube	1
I love this game ! You ca n't say that you are a Zelda fan , if you do n't own this game . This game features an awesome storyline , unforgettable characters , and just keeps getting better . You could play this game forever , and not get tired of it ! If you have a N64 system , you better own this game ! Or if you have a Gamecube , you should have the Legend of Zelda Collectors Disk !	1
Unless you 've been living in a box your whole life , chances are you 've heard about what an incredible game this is . Nay , I will go as far as to say perfect . Even if you have n't grown up with the Zelda series , you 're still likely to find this game quite enjoyable . It 's safe to say that this game was nothing short of revolutionary , and it continues to be one of my favorite video games of all time.The story begins as a young Link awakens in a small tree hut . Staying true to past games , you start off with no items or weapons . You soon learn that the Great Deku Tree wishes to see Link , and thus you set out to explore Kokiri Forest . Upon taking your first steps outside , you meet the elfish inhabitants of the forest . While you search the area for a sword , you have time to get accustomed to the controls and the environment . Once you have sufficiently explored the forest and gathered the required items , you head for the Great Deku Tree , accompanied by your faerie friend Navi . After completing this first dungeon , the Deku Tree explains the history of the Triforce and rewards Link with the Spiritual Stone of the Forest , thus setting the story in motion.The graphics of this game are fantastic for its time . You can now journey through a fully navigable 3D map . The details of the environment properly capture the mood of each setting , be it a forest village , a watery temple , a haunted underground maze , or the inside of a giant fish 's belly . The map of Hyrule is pretty expansive and full of places and objects to explore . The cinematic sequences look great and tie the segments of the story together well.I absolutely love the controls in this game . Everything is pretty intuitive : the A Button is used to execute actions , the B Button swings your sword , and the C Buttons allow you to store up to three items to use during play . You 're able to roll and jump , swim and climb , block attacks , stab , and build up power for swing attacks . But the greatest addition to the control features is the Z Targeting ability . This function allows you to lock on to people and enemies and focus a particular action on the targeted object . Moreover , this button will focus the camera directly behind Link , allowing you to have control over your point of view . To this day , I compare games ' camera controls to Ocarina of Time , often wishing for that very desirable Z Targeting capability . A great addition to your supply of character controls.The story itself builds upon previous games in the series , for we interact with familiar characters like Zelda and Ganondorf in addition to many new individuals . As always , there are a whole variety of weapons and items to collect during your travels , some that are familiar and some that are new to this title . What makes this game even more engaging is the idea of traveling through time . You begin the story as a child , growing as a warrior and searching for the Spiritual Stones . When you travel into the future , the world has become darker and your missions more challenging . There is a constant interplay between the past and the present as you try to make your way through the dungeons and numerous side quests . The multitude of puzzles , games , and items to collect makes this story very immersive and entertaining . The endearing characters that you meet provide for a rich , enjoyable plot , furthering your adventure along with their dialogue and aid.And the game would not be complete without sound . Again , Ocarina of Time gains a perfect score here . The sounds that Link makes when he fights , moves , and interacts with others are both enjoyable and believable . The echoes that your character makes are varied depending on what type of environment he is in . Likewise , the soundtrack is just as appropriate . Each level has a different musical score , and each song blends in beautifully with the surroundings . Also , some of the songs are familiar tunes from the previous games , transformed just right for a sound that is nostalgic , yet new . The ocarina songs are appealing as well , adding another interesting component to the gameplay . Ocarina of Time really has a wonderful soundtrack , and even today I still enjoy listening to it.All in all , this game is truly a classic , and yet another impressive sequel in the Zelda series . From the sensible controls to the superb storyline to the awesome soundtrack , Ocarina of Time is a gem in the adventure game genre .	1
simply the best . great story , great graphics , great control , great replay value . it is true , n64 wasnt that great of a system , with pretty horrible games . i bought it back in 98 and up until i got my ps2 i only bought a few games for it , Zelda : ocarina , Zelda : Majora , Goldeneye , Perfect Dark , and DK64 . There may be other good games but this game is by far the best , not just on n64 but possibly out of all video games ever . trust me people , if i say it is good , it is good . I dont give out good reviews very easily .	1
The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time is really awesome , but how awesome ? Is it the best of the Legend of Zelda series so far ? Oh , undeniably , but that is not the point . My point is that it was the best game for the Nintendo 64 , with Super Mario 64 and its direct sequel , Majora 's Mask in a second place draw . It shows how the franchise began . Link sets off on a journey to save Hyrule from the evil Ganondorf for the first time . He meets Princess Zelda on the way , and when she flees from Ganondorf , she leaves the Legendary Ocarina of Time in Link 's possession . He uses it to travel through seven years with the help of the Master Sword . The graphics were neat for the time , the storyline was really exciting , and there is a lot of stuff to collect . The dungeons were challenging , and the boss fights are neat . If you are a fan of Nintendo , please pick this up . You will be glad you did .	1
With almost three years in the making , how did The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time stand the test of time itself ? As a prequel to the entire Legend of Zelda series , it has caught heavy anticipation . Ocarina is a prequel to the events before A Link to the Past . Link is a child , whose destiny is to save the land of Hyrule from Ganon ( Gannondorf here ) by traveling through time . You 'll meet up with other characters in the adventure and interact will fellow Hylians , Kokiri , Zoras , and other civilations who aid you on your quest to save Hyrule . Ocarina of Time is one of those controversial games that the series has carried all along . In the end , the game is an Action/RPG , and should never be classified in the style of traditional , turn-based RPG 's ( like Final Fantasy ) .New additions to the series are automatic jumping and Z-targeting . The emphasis of the Zelda games has always been puzzle-solving and dungeon arrangement . You also build your attributes , receiving items including the Ocarina , learning songs whose purposes range from teleporting to opening doors to time traveling . Along with mini-games , hidden items and side quests equal , its a worthwhile experience . Graphics-wise , Hyrule never looked better and most effects in Ocarina of Time are outstanding . No need for sharp visuals and smooth framerates , but rather focus on detail and designer talent . The real-time cutscenes and the passing of day and night are impressive . The sound also holds its own on this cartridge format . The themes of Zora 's Domain and Gerudo Valley are music to the ears . Zelda fans will remember tunes of Kakariko Village and Zelda 's Lullaby . A big plus is that all the sound effects from previous Zelda games have made a comeback.In the end , The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time makes the cut . Even though the gameplay consists mainly of dungeon-dwelling and puzzle-solving , the impressive graphics , quality sound and everything that 's been obtained from previous Zelda titles will keep fans and non-fans alike entertained . It 's fun .	1
Ok , I figured I 'd throw in my opinion as well . Mainly , this review is for people who have not played the game yet and are wondering if they should . Perhaps you are n't too into RPGs or whatever , so it is my job to convince you ! First off , it 's more of an RPG/adventure combination , since it does n't use conventional RPG techniques like turns or experience . But that is a good thing , because the way the game is structured allows for near-total freedom as you play it . Yes , like some people have said , you must beat the dungeons in a certain order , but there are about a million other things you can do whenever you want , and that just expands the boundaries of this game even more . It is truly the greatest game I have ever played , that is no exaggeration . The graphics and the sound are wonderful , the puzzles are NOT as easy as some people are saying -- the Water Temple is maddening ! -- and the character development and depth of play is unmatched.Majora 's Mask is almost as good , but what makes Ocarina of Time better , in my opinion , is the fact that it is sort of the & quot ; ultimate & quot ; Zelda game , meaning it starts from the beginning and recreates the entire story of Link and Zelda and Ganon , and it is a completely stand-alone and definitive game . Majora 's Mask , on the other hand , takes place right after the events of Ocarina of Time and has a very different structure . The three-day cycle you must live through makes for an extremely enjoyable game , but the only downside is you ca n't take your time and relish everything like you can in Ocarina of Time.Either way , though , Ocarina of Time is a beautiful game .	1
The best game I ever play . In fact , I beat this game in a week . It 's a good deal and is worth the money . ( big time )	1
I have played many many many video games in my life , and this game is literally the best game that I have ever played in my life . It 's nice and long ( like all the other Zelda games ) It has a perfect level of difficulty , there are so many different weapons in the game , there are so many memorable dungeons and fields in the game , well , I could go on forever . I wish I could give this game a higher score than the measly 5-star rating Amazon.com forces me to give but alas , i can not . If you own a Nintendo 64 , BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW ! If you do n't own an N64 , you can still buy it for gamecube , it 's the same exact game . I own it for both N64 and Gamecube . If you like this game , then buy the sequel too ! It 's called Majora 's mask . I 'm telling you , you will definetly not regret buying this game if you are a die-hard Zelda fan ... Or even if you are not a die-hard Zelda fan . Although I do n't know who would be reading a review of a game that was made in nineteen ninety-something , in 2007 ... IF YOU ARE READING THIS , BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW , AND IF YOU DO N'T YOU ARE MISSING OUT ! ! Everything about this game is perfect ! ... That is all .	1
This is the 2nd best game I 've ever played ! Even if I like Excitebike 64 more , I ca n't wait until I can get this ! I do n't have it , but my brother and I got all the way to Forest Temple from the start in just 3 days . Then we had to return it . But It 's my favorite Zelda game ever .	1
Face the facts , all these young gamers in the world do not know what it is like to grow up with a legacy on your TV screen . I do . Upon first playing of the OOT I found it to be quite exhilirating and as game play continued , I was reminded of the greatness of those that came before it . Yes , the game was a little difficult , but if you whine about how you could n't get past the first level , either gain some skills or do not enter the arena with true gamers . If you did not play the original Zelda you will not do well with this one . This is by far the greatest Zelda of the series and I ca n't wait to see what the future hods . True gamers , you know what I mean .	1
Ocarina Of Time is definitely the best game on the Nintendo 64.Super Mario 64 , Perfect Dark and F Zero X are awesome but Ocarina Of Time is the best out of any other game on the system.What else is there to say about a game that changed the way we look at Role Playing games forever ? The graphics are awesome ( some Game Cube games dont look this good ) the music adds excitement and the challenges are excellent.Whereas the difficulty in Super Mario 64 stayed pretty much the same throughout the game Ocarina Of Time gets harder when you get to be a better player.Also you get an extra heart after beating bosses because youll need it.Its very challenging I still havent beaten it and am not sure if I ever will.Easy games can be a lot of fun but they just arent as substantial as a game like this.The challenge makes it fun as well as the graphics and controls . Its just a great game and is a must for any Zelda fan or just someone who loves challenging games .	1
What is n't great about this game ? I 'm so glad that this game has so many reviews because it definitely deserves it . Ocarina of Time remains one of my favorite videogames of all time . Yes , the generation of gaming is getting wider and graphics are getting beautiful with each console but The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time , on N64 , does n't add up to them . Well , at least to me it does n't . I 've seen a few 1 star reviews about people bashing the game only because it 's no `` everquest '' or `` Halo '' . This game is so good that you do n't compare its style or graphics with something in today 's modern gaming . This is an old school game . You just do n't compare old games to new ones . I believe there 's a favorite for every generation . This one happened to fall into the N64 genre , when gaming was really starting to pick up . And honestly , you think over 700 5-star reviews were written all by children ? We were children when we all played the game ! And looking back as adults now we cherish it as a classic and one of the best in videogame history . Kids that did n't get to exprience the NES , SNES , and N64 missed out on a great gaming genre and though the generation of gaming today is awesome there 's nothing on the classics.Ocarina of Time remains my favorite game of all time , even before some of my new favorites and there 's nothing like turning on that N64 and playing over and over again . I never tire of this game . It is a true classic .	1

Buy this game and become part of the adventure ! Travel through time to play both child and adult Link . Ocarina of Time never gets boring or tedious , and is neither too hard nor too easy for any level of gaming skill . If you missed it in 1998 , it 's time to get it and get in on the action !

Once again , Hyrule is being threatened by the forces of evil ! As Link , the chosen hero you solve countless puzzels , and fight many , many , monsters ! This game has about everything ! Good graphics , great gameplay , and a wonderful story.Ganondorf , the evil in the game , needs to get the tree spiritual stones to open the Tempe of Time . He threatened the people who have them , but they did n't give him the stones . Link goes on quests to get the tree stones . Once he gets them and Zelda , the princess , gives him the Ocarina of Time , he opens the Temple of Time . But little does he know , Ganondorf followed him.Seven years later link wakes up and Ganondorf rules Hyrule . He spreaded five of the six medallions and had monsters gaurd them .

I highly recommend it and for anyone who has a Nintendo 64 , get this game for your 64 collection is n't complete without it .	1
I remembered a time my older brother borrowed this game from a friend of his . I liked it so much but when it came to the time for my brother to give it back i was upset . But no worries I was 7 at the time when that happened now that I 'm older i was able to buy my own copy .	1
One of the best games of all time.You get the thrill of beating all the bosses , playing the ocarina , and riding Epona around Hyrule . Never going to regret getting this game . One of my favorites .	1
The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time may be difficult at times for some of the temples were designed to make you think but this game is the best game I have ever played in my entire life.I have been playing nintendo for years and I have played some of the older Zelda games before but I never owned any , as soon as I tried this game - I immediately loved it and I 've played it millions and millions of times . I am so obsessed with it , I went out and pre-ordered the Wind Waker to get the Zelda bonus disc and renewed my subscription twice to Nintendo Power to get the Zelda Collector 's Edition disc.There is no need for me to review this game - all I really need to say is buy it . You will not be disappointed ( if you are a nintendo fan or have a brain ) . Definitely be sure to get the follow up Majora 's Mask and the Wind Waker . A must play and Link is the best hero ever .	1
man , i remember getting this game when i was around 9 years old , and alll those hours i spent beating this game over and over again . I Gurantee I 've beaten this game at least 100 times , Honestly ! Though the N64 is outdated , from time to time I take it out of my closet and plug it in just to play this game . I hope the twilight princess will be just the same !	1
Go out and buy it and play it yourself and see what I mean ok . The level 's are great and there is alot to do . The places that you go are in the mountain 's lake 's valley 's and in cave 's and a little ranch somewhere ? Link lives in Kokiri Forest.In the game you have to get three stones somewhere . One in the Deku Tree and One in Goron City and One in the Zora 's Domain . Some time in the game you will be older , by the time you look around the place will be dead.You as Link and you have to save the world form evil form the evil king name Ganondori and his evil plan 's before it 's too late . And save a beautiful princess name Zelda . And you get to meet other characters in the game too some are cool some are big and some are small.Buy the ( The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of time Official Strategy Guide ) it 's a big help to me and you if you with it.Everything Revealed to YOU.PS . I know everything in the game do you . I PLAY IT AND I LOVE IT .	1
If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game . It 's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists , new terrain and interesting characters.If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title & quot ; The Wind Waker & quot ; and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of & quot ; Ocarina of Time & quot ; for Game Cube . Not just the good old & quot ; Ocarina of Time , & quot ; made famous on N64 , but also an enhanced version called & quot ; Master Quest. & quot ; Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.Happy Hunting .	1
When I first got my Gamecube , this game was part of the Zelda collector 's edition . I did n't know much about Zelda , and had only played very few games before , but was mesmerized by this game . The beginning of it is so magical and imaginative ; it really draws you in to the story . I found myself playing through the beginning of it over and over again because I did n't have my memory card yet . This game takes place in a vivid fantasy world that is vibrant , ominous , beautiful , and haunting . I had never experienced anything like it . To this day I have never been so absorbed by another game.What 's really impressive is that this whole game is very consistent . The music is also exceptional . The music is better than most movie soundtracks , in my opinion . All of it perfectly accompanies what is happening in the game . So much happens in this game ; it has a lot of cinematic scenes too , which really develop the story , which is an excellent tale of good versus evil.Ocarina of Time stimulated my imagination at a young age more than just about anything I know of . There are a few films and books that would come close , but I ca n't think of anything that could quite surpass it . Ocarina of Time is an involving , authentic , scary , and epic adventure . Playing it for the first time makes for an unparalleled experience .	1
This is one of the best games ! You have to play it . It is definitely the best game in the Zelda series so far . It has adventure , romance , mystery , and SO many subquests . It 's about a boy named Link who has a destiny . He lives in Kokiri Village , a little tiny village in the land of Hyrule . Anyway , a little fairy named Navi comes and says that he must meet the Deku Tree . He does and the Deku Tree tells him to go inside the Deku Tree and destroy all of the evil monsters inside him . Link does this and the Deku Tree gives him the Kokiri Emerald , or the Spiritual Stone of Forest . The Deku Tree phrophesies that Ganondorf , an evil desert Gerudo man , is trying to get hold of the Triforce , the essence of life in Hyrule . But in order to get hold of the Triforce you have to get three of the spiritual stones . Unfortuantely , after the tree 's prophecy , he died because of the curse Ganondorf had cast upon him . But Link and Navi go on their journey and get the Goron 's Ruby , or Spiritual Stone of Fire and the Zora 's Sapphire , or Spiritual Stone of Water . Link gets the Ocarina of Time but when he opens the doors Ganondorf gets in before him and he gets the Triforce . Link waits seven years in the Chamber of Time and when he awakes he 's all grown up . Rauru , the Sage of Light is there and tells him that he must save all the Sages from their temples and receive the medallions . He receives the Medallion of Light , Forest , Fire , Water , Shadow , and Spirit . But the game . It 's definitely one of the best N64 games around !	1
There comes a point when sooner or later one has to admit that they have reached a mile stone . This is it . Look no further than the game that changes everything that went before it . Yes , certainly other games can compete graphically with this , but innovation is an entirely different proposition . Zelda , then , innovates on an unparalleled scale . Weather , night/day , age , all real aspects which merely touch the surface of this monumentous achievement.To be really honest , there is no real weakness with this game . No puzzle will stop you in your tracks . There is ALWAYS something to do . In fact it will take you a lot longer to find everything the game has to offer than it would to finish other games . And this is where the distinction comes in . You can label this as an adventure game if you like . But , it is beyond comparison with everything else . Thus meaning that it should be catagorised in a genre by itself . Or at least as a game that redefines an entire genre.There are no comparisons . Forget other inferior games that try and emulate and 'better ' this . Forget the games that rely on pretty visuals to impress . Zelda has all these and so , so , much more . Buy this , it is that simple .	1
Classic game . A favorite when I was a kid . Still fun to this day , I just wish the graphics were better ! Got to remember this game is from 98 and one of the first 3D games of it 's time ! Great game .	1
The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of time is an incredible game and is one of my top ten games of all time , but it is neither the best N64 game or the best game in the series . It is the second best of both . The best N64 game is Mario 64 , and the best Zelda game is the Wind Waker . That said , this is one of the most innovative , most fun , and most interesting games of all time . The overworld is HUGE , there are a ton of items and weapons to collect throughout the game , and there are plenty of interesting enemies and bosses to fight . Ocarina of Time is a true classic.Presentation- 90/100Graphics- 98/100Sound- 96/100Gameplay- 99/100Replay Value- 96/100Overall- 97.5/100	1
I remember all the hype surrounding The Legend Of Zelda : The Ocarina Of Time like it was just yestarday . The Zelda franchise has always been among the best to grace any video game system , and with the power of the soon-to-be-released Nintendo 64 , the series was finally going to reach its next step : the third dimension . This ( along with other titles like Super Mario 64 and Mario Kart 64 ) got both gamers and the press excited about the N64 and the upcoming Zelda game . While the Nintendo 64 never quite managed to live up to all its prerelease hype , The Legend Of Zelda : The Ocarina of Time managed to not only live up to its respected hype , but in many ways surpass it.What makes TOOT special IMO is the fact that it is the first game ( that I 've played ) where you truly feel like a part of its world . Many games tried hard to accomplish this feat , including previous Zelda titles , but TOOT was the first game to finally get it right . Even the later Majora 's Mask never quite managed to create the immersive world TOOT did.Much of the game 's feeling stems from the interactivity of its world . You can spend hours exploring a certain area and still have not seen everything there is to see . For example , many of the game 's locations have these hidden holes you can jump into and find hidden goodies ( as well as hear some pretty haunting music ) . Once you obtain the Stone Of Agony , however , you find out that these randomly placed secrets are only the beginning . I wo n't go into too much detail here since you need to play the game for yourself to really appreciate it . Another thing that makes this game feel more realistic than previous Zeldas is character interaction . Remember how decidedly generic a lot of the NPCs in Zeldas II and III were ? In TOOT , each and every NPC is given at least some sort of personality so that you can easilly distinguish him/her from the rest of the game 's characters as well as once again feel like you 're a part of Hyrule . And of course , the third dimension ( the dimension we live life through ) helps the game a great deal.The gameplay is equally great . I especially liked how you can hold three items at a time rather than just one , which is especially helpful in the game 's dungeons which often require you to use several different weapons/items . Speaking of which , the dungeons have some of the most clever puzzles and interesting layouts of any game I had ever played . And I really liked how once you completed all the puzzles in a dungeon , you opened a new path from its starting point straight to the final boss , rather than simply having to run through the entire dungeon all over again after death the way you did in previous Zeldas ( this was especially annoying in A Link To The Past , where the dungeons were much longer and more challenging than in the original Legend of Zelda ) . And of course , the game 's graphics are among the N64 's best ( not necessarely because of how detailed/realistic they are , but how carefully crafted and full of life they are ) , and the soundtrack is among the best ever to grace a video game ( even with the Star Fox 64-quality midi samples ) .In brief , The Legend Of Zelda : The Ocarina of Time is an excellent game . If you own an N64 and have not already picked this game up , I strongly suggest you do . If you do not even own an N64 , than the system 's worth picking up just for this one game and its semi-sequal Majora 's Mask .	1
This last year of 2003 ET did a survey about the best video game series ever . Zelda one there poll and this game is one of the reasons why.Ocarina of Time tells the continuing story of the Zelda universe . In the Zelda timeline it takes place before the other games . As usual you are the hero Link . You must save the princess Zelda . You have different quests you must finish and many obstacles that will block your way . The story is that Ganondorf the evil wizard is trying to take over the world . Equipped with the Ocarina of Time you will travel time in your quest to save Zelda , Hyrule , and the world.This game is jam packed with stuff to do . I 'd say you have a garunteed 40 hours of gameplay . It has all the classic Zelda weapons and more . You get to ride a horse across the country side and do some impressive underwater work . There are just so many impressive factors.I love this game . I ca n't thing of words to describe how good it is . If you have an N64 your collection is not complete until this game is put in it .	1
Let me put it like this , if I had to destroy every videogame I own except one , this is the one I would n't destroy . This is simply the greatest game ever made . I 'm not going to insult this game by trying to describe the storyline or graphics etc.. You have to experience it for yourself . Most helpful thing I can do is tell you how you can get to play this . This game has had dozens of ports . One came on a bonusdisc for Gamecube with `` Windwaker '' in 2003 and another came in a collectors edition ( Master Quest ) also for gamecube . If you ca n't get ahold of one of these , the original for N64 , or a ROM you should buy a Wii and download it from the Wii Virtual Console . It will be worth the while .	1
I really should have the kids writing this I think they liked this game but yet there was something lacking in all the zelda games	1
Zelda is eailsy the best game I have ever played . The graphics are excellent , you forget you are playing a game . My dad thought it was a cartoon . The story is wonderful , too . I wo n't give anything away , but I almost cried at the end . And the music is great . You will find yourself humming the Gerudo theme song . I highly recommend this game , but I suggest you buy a strategy guide even if you normally play this game without one ... It 's really hard and you will probally get stuck in the water temple just like everyone else ... I had to start over about three times . But the replay value is good , too . That 's why I give Zelda 5 stars ! ! !	1
Seriously . As awesome as the games before and after this game are , there is truly NO touching OOT . The story is amazing and well thought out , the game play is simple , the music is suburb , and all console Zelda games stem from this right here . SUCH as excellent game . There is no surprise many gaming magazines regard OOT as the greatest Zelda game or Video Game ... of all time .	1
Back in the late 1990s I wrote two articles for a now defunct game website about `` Ocarina of Time '' . One is a review of the title , and the other is the how in many ways Ocarina of Time feels like a remake of the eternal SNES classic ( and my personal favorite Zelda game ) , THE LEGEND OF ZELDA : A LINK TO THE PAST . Rather than leave them unposted , I issued them on Amazon back in 2007 , one article on the `` Collector 's Edition '' ( `` Zelda 64 a Remake ? '' and and one on the `` Regular '' edition ( an actual review of the game ) . When the 3DS version came out , I wrote a review of that and included both articles on the review as well for bonus content . Originally this review only featured one of the two articles - I am now putting both articles up.Mike London , 9-9-2012 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -This commentary on `` Ocarina of Time '' was written as a gaming article for a retro-gaming site back in May of 1999 . I was going to post it on Amazon but for some reason never got around to it . Mike London , November 3 , 2007Article 1 : Does `` Zelda 64 '' really live up to all the hype ? [ Blurb : With all the hype , its hard to be objective about OoT . Is it the best game in the series , or does it have to settle for second ( or , egad , third ? ) best ? Is it like Star Wars Episode I , all special effects and no substance ? Find out a few thoughts from a fellow gamer ! ] The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time is easily one of the most hyped games of recent gaming history . In fact , I think I could safely say it IS the most hyped game yet . There is only one thing that can compare to it in terms of hype , and this product is in an entirely different industry . Star Wars : Episode I had the same amount of coverage . Being a big fan of both , of course I 've beat the game and have seen the movie . And they have one thing in common . They 're both eye candy . But how do they hold up to the rest of the series ? In my opinion , The Empire Strikes Back is by far the best Star Wars movie . But what about OoT you ask ? How can I defame such an instant classic ? One reason mainly . In the original and in The Legend of Zelda : Link to the Past , ( I ca n't speak for Zelda II because I have n't beat it yet ) the ending was spectacular . Not the game ending , for The Legend of Zelda was produced in the Stone Age and there was much ending wise , but the last dungeon . Ah , the last dungeon . Only recently ( like December 23 , 1999 ) have I beat the first quest of The Legend of Zelda . That last dungeon on Death Mountain was a killer , a true challenge that you had to match your mettle with to get past it , save Princess Zelda and beat that nasty ol ' Gannon . It was truly a great dungeon . Now skip on past those five years between the release of the original and the SNES version . What have we here ? A dungeon comparable to that in the original Legend of Zelda ! Everything is bigger and better in the SNES version , including the last dungeon . Whew , and I thought the original was harder , but no way ! Then , in 1993 , we see the release of the Game Boy version of Zelda . The Legend of Zelda : Link 's Awakening was released to a very receptive crowd . But guess what ! No end dungeon ! In terms of dungeons , this is the smallest of the Zelda titles ( again , not including Zelda II ) . You beat eight dungeons , and then you go and beat the Wind Fish . Personally , I 'm half a dungeon away from completing this Zelda game ( Dungeon Seven , which I completed half of , went and beat eight , and now I 'm back on the last half of VII ) . That last dungeon was challenging , granted , but what about that classic end dungeon ? No where to be found here . Granted , it 's a Game Boy game , and it is huge for that consol . So that offence is not to serious . And we did get a new dungeon , though not the ending I was hoping for , with the Colour Dungeon on DX , which was the rerelease of the classic game for Game Boy Colour.After five long years , The Legend of Zelda : Orcarina of Time was released for the N64 . So cool ! Link in a 3D adventure . About time too . Mario , the cash cow counterpart to Link , got his 3D adventure way back in ` 96 . Of course , I bought the game . And of course , I beat it . It is an excellent game . Truly it is one of the great classics . But one flaw keeps it from edging out The Legend of Zelda : Link to the Past . The end dungeon absolutely sucked . That is my only disappointment with that game . As I was nigh the close of the Shadow Temple , I was really looking forward to getting into Gannon 's tower . I was expecting a great closer dungeon , just like in Link to the Past . [ Spoiler : If you have n't beat the 64 version of Zelda , do n't read this ] What did we get ? Instead of a great closer dungeon , we got a door way that was blocked by barriers . What did we have to do ? Go thru six rooms and beat whatever was in them , then go and shoot the barrier corresponding with each temple to open the pathway . And what did I get ? A great disappointment . Sure , this might have been a good way to end a novel or something , but to end a Zelda game like that was horrible . The Game Boy was forgivable and acceptable , but this ending to Zelda 64 was truly despicable . That has been my biggest disappointment with the Zelda series . [ Spoiler Finished ] Others say The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time is the best Zelda game . I have to disagree . Do n't get me wrong . It is easily one of my favorite games of the N64 . It 's a great game , very innovative ( espically that nifty Z Targeting feature ) and an epic in its own right . But for what the system is capable of , The Legend of Zelda : Link to the Past beats it out of the coveted title of Best Zelda Game . LTTP is huge . It fully utilized the SNES technology . It had a full twelve dungeons , two of which the sole purpose was to beat the bad guy , and not try to retrieve any medallions or crystals or pendents or pieces of triforce or what ever . That 's one more than the original has . ( LoZ has one closer dungeon for each quest . ) After you beat the bad guy twice , you go and fight Ganon . There were plenty of side quests for an SNES Zelda also . Overall , for the system 's capabilites , LTTP is my favorite.But what about The Legend of Zelda : OoT ? My two chief complaints are these:1 . Weak closer dungeon ( as I spent a good time detailing up above ) .2 . Not enough bad guys to kill in the Overworld.All other Zelda games , including the black sheep of the family ( Zelda II ) , has plenty of bad guys to kill in the Overworld . But what have we in OoT ? A few measly skeleton dudes at night , and some giant flying plants that you can hardly get too in Hyrule Field . Give me the old Zelda with bad guys streaming at you in every new screen . For all the time they put into it , you do n't think it would be to hard to correct this problem.Then we come to another mistake Nintendo made in the N64 version of Zelda . Granted , LoZ had two main tracks , one being the Overworld theme and then the dungeon theme . They could have had more variety , but it was back in the Stone Age . That Overworld Theme became pretty much the theme of the entire series . And guess what they decided to omit music wise from OoT ? The Overworld them from the original LoZ ! I could n't believe they did that ! Hopefully we 'll see it in Zelda Gaiden . Maybe the Triforce will show up in that game too . Just a thought.Now , after railing on OoT for a great majority of this article , you may think I hate the game . Quite the opposite , really . It 's a great game , and worthy to be in the Zelda Series . ( Gee , it sounds like I 'm defending Zelda II , which I 've already done in a separate article ) . But it has been the single most hyped up game in the history of Nintendo , and it is totally out of balance . Great 3D game , but would have been better had it corrected the problems I stated above . It 's a fun game , and I had a great time beating it . It provides a lot of enjoyment . But , just like Star Wars : Episode I , it just ca n't live up to all that hype ? I wonder if any game ( or movie ) could actually . [ May 9 , 1999 . An article originally written for NintendoLand.com . I 've written four released articles and one unreleased article ( dealing with SMB 2 ) . It will have to be edited . Also , perhaps incorporating part of the structural symmetry article . ] ... .. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Article 2 : [ Originally this was written for a retro-gaming site back in early January , 2000 . It has never appeared on Amazon . ] Zelda 64 a Remake ? [ Blurb : Zelda 64 and SNES Zelda has several similarities , almost to the point that the basic game design of Zelda 64 is a remake . Read here for more information on this intriguing phenomena ! Just a few thoughts from a fellow gamer ! ] After playing the course of The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time , I 've noticed something very intriguing about it . It seems to be a rehash of what I feel is the best Zelda game : LoZ : Link to the Past . Why do I say this ? I say this because there are several structural symmetries that lie between Zelda 64 and LTTP.Lets examine it . For one , there are three pendants you have to acquire in LTTP . This is after you go and rescue Zelda and leave her at the temple . Well , this time around , you do n't rescue Zelda , but you do go and talk to her . After that , when you get the three pendants , you go and she is kidnaped . This is after you get the Master Sword in the Lost Woods . In Zelda 64 , you go thru the first part of the quest , getting three spiritual stones . After you get those three spiritual stones ( which I think the tower on LTTP is much better than that d -- -- - Lord Jabu Jabu 's belly . I hated that dungeon ! = ) ) , you go to the town . Guess what , as Link approaches , there it cuts to a cinema , and Zelda is kidnaped by Ganondorf . Hmm . . . have n't we seen this story before ? It turns out that you have to get 5 of the Sage 's medallions . Rauru conveniently gives you one , so we can cut the sixth one away . Only by getting the six sage medallions can you open the bridge to fight Ganondorf . How intriguing.In the superiour SNES Zelda counterpart , it is seven crystals , and you do n't get one given to you . Link wakes no sages this time . Instead , the seven maidens of the wise men descent have been hidden in deep dank dungeons , and Link has to transverse thru 13 dungeons all together , 5 the first part , and eight the second part . They are challenging , fun , and intriguing . Granted , Zelda 64 has some great stuff . But it is not as consistent as LTTP . After you have gone thru the seven dungeons ( two more than in Zelda 64 ) , you now have all seven crystals . That 's great ! Now , go to Death Mountain , and by doing so you will open the way to Ganon 's big bad temple.Okay , what do we have in Zelda 64 ? You go and get the five medallions , plus the one that Rauru gives you as Link . Guess what ? Now you have to go to his tower , and open the rainbow bridge with the six medallions . * Hmm . . . is n't that what we did in SNES Zelda ? Why , I do believe it is , Watson ! Another issue yet addressed is the Light World/Dark World . Zelda 64 does the same thing , save this time it is time traveling ( I 'm not even going to go into the impossibilities of time travel on this . . . that 's a whole separate article in itself ) . In SNES Zelda , you have a little mirror the old man gave you . There are eight transporters located thruout Hyrule , transporting back and forth . If you are in the Dark World , you can use the mirror to go into the Light World , making a temporary transporter . Well , in Zelda 64 , there is no mirror or transporters ( the closest to a mirror is the Lens of Truth , found nigh in the Shadow Temple ) . But if you go and put the sword back , then you go back to being young . That creates two versions of the same world to explore . That structural symmetry corresponds to LTTP . Not only that , but at the end if the first three stones , Link goes to the Temple of Time and gets the sword . This is after the three Spiritual Stones goes into place . Hmm . . . is n't that what happened in LTTP ? After getting the three pendents , Link goes to the Lost Woods and retrieves the Master Sword . But he can not do that until he has all three pendents . Well , that 's the same in Zelda 64 . He ca n't get the Ocarina of Time , now can he retrieve the sword , until he wins the corresponding three spiritual stones . I swear I 've played this game before . . . . ; ) The real question is why did Nintendo do this ? Well , Miyamoto is a great gamming god , but as far as stories go , his team is not that good at having connecting story lines that make sense . Again , another article , another time . The structural symmetries lying between Zelda 64 and LTTP is quite frightening . Who knows why they chose to do that ? Granted , the story line is different , but quite a few of the fundamentals behind both pieces are indeed the same . In review : A Listing of Structural Symmetries between SNES Zelda and Zelda 641 . SNES : First Part , Link goes and retrieves three pendants after rescuing Zelda . This is to get the Master Sword . Upon doing so , and after giving the Pendants up to retrieve the Sword , Zelda is kidnaped.2 . N64 : Link , after receiving a mission from the Deku Tree , goes and wins the three Spiritual Stones . Upon doing so , he goes to Hyrule City , but not before learning Zelda is kidnaped . He places the three Spiritual Stones in their place , and the Door of Time is opened , and there the sword is . Retrieving the Sword , goes to the Temple of Sages , or whatever it is called . Is given first Sage Medallion.3 . SNES : After winning the three pendents , Link must now go between two versions of the world ( Light World/Dark World ) . Link must go back and forth between the two worlds to beat the game.4 . N64 : In this great stunning adventure , Link must go between two versions of his world . One is when he is young , the other when he is an adult . This is achieved by putting the sword back in its pedestal . Just like in SNES LTTP , Link have to go back and forth to finish the game.When he is an adult , things are noticeable more evil , for Ganon 's power has grown.5 . SNES : One version ( Light World ) is good because not corrupted by Ganon . Version II ( Dark World ) , is an evil corrupted version of the Light World.6 . N64 : One version ( Young Link 's world ) is not corrupted by Ganon 's evil . Ganon has just recently showed up . Version II ( Adult Link 's world ) , is an evil corrupted version ( albeit older ) of Young Link 's world . The only difference is in one its two different versions of the same thing , in Zelda 64 it 's the time barrier . But for game play , they 're the same.7 . SNES : He , Link , must recover seven crystals hidden in seven dungeons ( sounds logical ) . With the maidens ' power , they will open to door to Ganon 's castle.8 . N64 : Link has to recover five medallions to open Ganon 's Tower.9 . SNES : The ( massive ) closer dungeon is a tower.10 . N64 : The ( weak ) closer dungeon is a tower.11 . SNES : After beating Ganon , you save Zelda , who had been kidnaped . Although one could argue you save her in Turtle Rock , she is still imprisoned in the Crystal with the other maidens , each in their respective Crystals.12 . N64 : Sticking to the standard Nintendo story , after recovering the medallions and beating Ganon , guess what , Link saves Zelda . There 's a shocker.13 . SNES : There are various mini-games , heart pieces , and extra things to do . This trend is continued in Link 's Awakening also.14 . Zelda 64 : Stuck with the trend of mini-games , four heart pieces to make a heart , and extra things to do.15 . SNES : In some of the houses , you can find a picture of Mario on the wall.16 . N64 : In Zelda 64 , after meeting Zelda , look out the window , and you can find some pictures of Mario , Luigi , Bowser , and the Princess . Yoshi also comes up . Malon and Talon wear Bowser amulets also . Just goes to show , Nintendo likes cameos.As you can see for yourself , the various structural symmetries between Zelda 64 and SNES Zelda is quit a few . If Miyamoto wanted to do a remake of LTTP for N64 that 's what he should have done , I suppose . This , as far as story goes , is pretty much an update with little changed . Its like they took the game 's basic plot , changed the circumstances and added where appropriate , but allowing the basic structure to stand . And , although both are great games , sadly , SNES is better , consistently with each dungeon getting a little harder and more complex . But I love Ocarina of Time all the same . This just helps support my believe that Nintendo is first and foremost a gaming company , not a writing company . *In all previous Zelda games , the end dungeon was in the mountains . This is the first game in the series to break that trend . The first three ( Zelda I , II , and LTTP ) their dungeon was in Death Mountain . Link 's Awakening , Link 's only Game Boy adventure ( currently ) is in Tal Tal Mountains . At least we have something that broke one of the several trends running thru this classic series .	1
This is one of the best games I have ever played . I love the gameplay . It was easy to control the character . I also enjoyed how it was n't a very easy game . When a game is challenging , I play it more and more . In fact , I still play this game today . Very good game .	1
This is the 2nd best Nintendo 64 game to date right behind Golden Eye 64 . We all know that Golden Eye 64 is impossible to top , but this comes damn near close.Zelda Ocarina of Time is a classic . Five stars plus . Matter of fact this is the best Zelda release I have ever played . And I have played them all.The graphics really show what the Nintendo 64 is capable of putting out along with other classics like Mario 64 and Golden Eye . The graphics are amazing and are top notch.The storyline is even better . Most good RPGs have more than just one single character . This game however only has Link and still manages to become a classic like most of the other Zelda titles . No this game is no Final Fantasy IIV , but in a way this game is better . Maybe not as long , but the storyline is a little bit more creative and catchy.Ocarina of Time offers a little bit more & quot ; extras & quot ; than the previous Zelda titles have to offer . You can collect extra items along the way for personal score to see how good your discovering ability is , and not just finding pieces of hearts . There are so many secrets with this game.I would suggest you dont use the strategy guide until you have completed the game . If you do , then you are cheating yourself and making the game not even worth playing . Beat the game and then look at the guide to see what you have missed.Overall , I spent a lot of time on this game . I could have beaten it a lot faster , but that wouldnt be any fun , because the fun part is discovering the secrets within the game itself.Buy the game and see for yourself . This isnt exactly a hard challenge of a game , but it isnt exactly that simple either . Just right . Get it today !	1
( Note : This is the Gamecube Collectors Edition version ) I remember ten years ago , seeing the commercial for this game.I always did wonder what it was like.After getting the collectors edition I immediately got started on it.The story focuses , as always , on Link.Link is a young boy living in the Kokiri Forest.One night he has a nightmare , and wakes to discover a fairy named Navi , who will help him through his journey.He is overjoyed but then discovers that the gaurdian of Kokiri Forest , the Great Deku Tree , is dying from a curse.The tree passes along a Spiritual Stone and recommends to see Princess Zelda.Link does so and Zelda tells him to get the other two spiritual stones so Link can get the Master Sword to stop Ganon , King of the Gerudos , from entering the Sacred Realm and stealing the Trifoce , a divine relic.Link achieves the other stones and the Ocarina of Time.Link draws the Sword and finds out he has been tricked by Ganon , who entered the Sacred Realm.Link awakens seven years later , and after discovering he is now an adult , meets Rauru the Sage of Light.According to Rauru , the only way to defeat Ganon is to awaken the Five Sages.That is where the true quest begins.Wow , what a story ! Now , the graphics are not bad by today 's standards.Neither are the dungeons.They are amazing.And also very complicated . ( Please do n't mention the Water Temple ) .Overall this game can be summed up by one word : Perfect.Buy the game , become the hero , and have the time of your life .	1
Ocarina of Time is a massive , epic Action/Adventure game out for the N64 . Many have been tempted to call it the best game ever ( just read some other reviews ) but I would step back from that . It is still one of my favorite games , despite the fact that I play mostly RPG 's . By the way , Zelda is not an RPG , even though you do talk to people and have a sword.In Zelda you play as Link ( Zelda is the princess , not the main character ) as you go on a quest to save the world from the evil Ganondorf by freeing each of six spirits from their different temples . You change between times , where you are adult or child Link , and you have to switch often , and do different things in both , and each time has different weapons and items . The time-traveling aspect of the game is one of the coolest parts.The real-time combat is a lot of fun , and fairly well put together . It involves a 'Z-targeting ' system in which you can select a monster and then keep it in the center of the screen and move around it . The fights against other monsters with swords and shields are great as a result . Z-targeting is not perfect , but it works well.The dungeons are all awesome , and very unique . Each dungeon is mostly based around one particular item or weapon , its own gimmick , but despite that they really do n't seem forced , and stay fresh all the way through ( although , the last couple dungeons are n't nearly as long as the others , almost like the designers started getting bored ) . For the most part the dungeons are n't too difficult if you know what to do , but it is very easy to get stuck if you do n't , and the game often leaves you on your own to figure out what to do , especially on side quests , so having a good walkthrough nearby is helpful.The overall story is n't too great ( for the most part , `` save the princess '' ) , but many of the individual events and side stories are neat . The characters and different races which populate the world are cool , especially the Gorons , which are one of the best races ever . The bosses of each dungeon are awesome , as well as being original , and can usually be beaten by hacking them up , or through the use of special tactics . It 's always good to have a choice.Despite how good it is , Zelda is n't perfect . The graphics , for example , are nice , but they are old , and on the N64 . The music is okay , but mostly just ambient , and the classic Zelda overworld theme is conspicuously missing . Having to constantly change which items you have equipped is also annoying , even if there is n't really a better system available . Some would say Zelda has an almost kiddy atmosphere and suffers from an occasional lack of seriousness ( I would tend to disagree ) . And of course , the fairy is annoying , but no reason to like the game any less.All in all , Zelda is a great game , and a must buy for any N64 owner , as it is one of the best Action/Adventure games ever . If you are looking for an RPG , look elsewhere . This is n't one . And be prepared to get a little frustrated . Zelda is pretty long , especially if you do everything there is to do . Maybe 25-30 hours if you run straight through , but it could take many more depending on how much extra stuff you do , or how often you get stuck . Have fun .	1
I first started playing Ocarina of Time from a good friend of mine . The graphics are really cool and it shows realistic images of stories . I do n't see why anybody would give this game only 1 star . I sure enjoyed the good pictures of this game . Next time I 'm in a video game store . I am going to buy this game . First of all , the adventure begins when this little boy is at home sleeping . A fairy comes to him and wakes him up . Then you have to find this sword and find the Great Deku Tree . I never get tired of this game because you travel to different places accomplishing many tasks ! There are many items you can use too ! I think The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time is even better than most playstation and playstation 2 games ! It is just that good to me.If you ever see this game in a store , buy it . You will have a good time with this game !	1
This is truely the best game for 64 becuase link is so cool . This is probabaly the best zelda game . Ganondorf is the man and you beat him in this game . If you havent played this game , i dont know but anyways in this one you could be big link and little link . Not like in majoros mask where you could only be little link . This game is way better than majoros mask . If you still have 64 ( get a gamecube , so you can play windwaker ) you need to get this great game .	1
This has been deemed the best-made game of all-time , and even though it 's going on 15 years since its release , I ca n't disagree.People complain that this game has no replay value , is too easy , and the graphics are n't good.Well , I 've revisited this game several times since it came out in 1998 , and I have n't found a lack of replay value ; there 's so many sub-missions , I do n't see how you ca n't think of this game as novel and new every time you replay it.This game has a perfect balance of gameplay for first-time gamers and extra sub-missions for experienced ones . Think it 's too easy ? Obviously you have n't gotten all the heart pieces , found all the Skulltulas , earned all the jars , achieved the Biggoron sword , or caught the Hylian Loach . Any one of those tasks would create a challenge for anyone.Complaining about the graphics ? Sorry , the game is n't on XBOX or Playstation format . In 1998 , this game had state-of-the-art graphics . As I am in the process of beating this game for a third time in 2011 , I still do n't find the graphics something to complain about.This game excels in both gameplay and storyline . I find it hard to believe that anyone who has played at least half this game would say they `` hate '' such a masterpiece .	1
From a graphics standpoint , this was and still is the best Legend Of Zelda ever . The story was great as well as the gameplay . All and all this was a great homecoming for the Hero of Hyrule . Great game from beginning to end . 10 stars .	1
An excellent game for those ( like me ) who like adventure and a new challenge . Zelda will leave you amazed . In the game you must save your world by fighting evil monsters , solving puzzles , beating bosses and temples etc. , and getting the items and weapons etc . you need in order to achieve these and other goals.You are the world 's last hope ! Can you save everyone and defeat the evil Ganondorf in this breathtaking adventure game ? !	1
This game is truly phenonemonal . From the amazing graphics ( for what it is ; a N64 game ) , to the music , to the challenging gameplay , to the engulfing storyline , the `` Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time '' is a must-play for any age . You start the game off as young Link ( or whatever you want to call him ) , who lives in an enchanted forest where young never grow old . Inside the forest , there is a godly tree , who could be considered to be infinitly wise . The tree senses Link has the power to overthrow a great evil which is arising , and tests him to the dungeon inside of him . Link comes out , sucessful , and the tree tells him the story of the great evil which is arising . From then on , you play young Link , and must overcome many obstacles . As a child , there are 3 dungeons , and the tree 's counts as one , so you 're making some time , right ? WRONG . There 's much more to this game then beating dungeons . As a child , you ca n't acess as many of the things , but after you advance 7 years to the future and attain the Master Sword , many of these things are then open to you . As a child , you got an ocarina , in which you must learn songs on to access special places or do special things . Now , you can do all those things , and more . My personal favorite is Epona 's song , in which you place a horse 's ( Epona ) song , and it comes to you , in which you can ride across Hyrule Field to get to places twice as fast . As a child , you have weapons like a stick ( whoopey ) , a sword , a shield , a sling-shot , and Duku Nuts . As an adult , you can handle 2 swords : the Master Sword , and the Giant Sword , which is so big you must handle it with 2 hands , which means no shield . You also have the hook-shot , Megaton Hammer , bow-and-arrows , and magic crystals you can do different things with . I can not begin to explain how amazing this game is . I 'd buy a Nintendo 64 all over again just for this . Now I have a Playstation 2 , and I still have my Nintendo 64 , but only play two games on it ; this , of course , and Super Smash Brothers . Now , do yourself a favor , buy this game , and experience teh magic yourself .	1
10/10 , one of the best games ever released on any console . The story-line is amazing , it captivates you swiftly . The game-play is also awesome , and the graphics , evil bosses , etc. , it 's just one of the best games in the market . At some point , we all wished to become Link , play a tune or two with an Occarina , and may day turn into night , or draw towards you a horse named Epona .	1
This game rules ! It was very well conceived . The storyline is good , and the gameplay is awesome . I rented it before , and found out it is a game to buy and play . Trust me , you will get your money 's worth ! Good graphics , excellent sound scores , huge worlds , and good characters pull this game together . I am yet to find a game that matches it 's surperiority , even Majora 's Mask was n't as good . I 've beaten it several times through , and sometimes wish that I did n't know it like the back of my hand .	1
First off , this game is very good considering it had very good graphics ( for an N64 ) and sound . Second of all , the storyline is the best I 've seen in ages . The boy from the woods that no one knows becomes the Hero of Time ... I would reveal more , but I do not want to spoil the game . Third , the gameplay and controls are easy to master , so you probably wont be swinging your sword at an enemy when you intended to throw bombs at it like games with complicated buttons . ( ; Fourth , the thing that makes Zelda , well , Zelda ! The dungeons . The puzzles in them are chalenging and fun . The scenery in the dungeons ( and everything else ) is amazing . Fith , the enemies are unique and mystique , making the worlds you explore even cooler . Overall , this game is THE top must have of the N64 gaming system . ...	1
Simply the best single player RPG i have ever played ! ! ! ! From start to finish you will not be dissapointed , , , Please if u get the chance go after majores mask its also a great game..	1
I 'll keep this short , as most people have probably already played this , but when this game released in 1996 there was literally NOTHING like it . no fully 3d adventure with the calibur of Ocarina of Time existed in those days . the sheer quality of this game was unheardof in 1996. the graphics were smiply beautiful for their time , and the gameplay was near perfection.You start the game as a young Kokiri boy living in the forest village with your friends and the old , wise Tree of Life . when darkness strikes your small corner of the world its up to you to delve into the tree and find out whats truly hurting and potentially killing him . after solving the situation in your home a much broader world of discovery and adventure opens up to you , and its up to you to save Hyrule.after completing 3 childhood dungeons and playing the song of time in the temple of time , you find yourself frozen in a time warp for 7 years , waking up at age 18 ( i believe ) waking up in adulthood you make your way across 5 more dungeons before conquering the final fortress , and facing one desperate final stand from the evil thats been behind all the trouble from the start.Truly epic in every way , considering the year it was released . Ocarina of Time is still the greatest game ever created in my opinion.10/10	1
Since Amazon is sort of combining Ocarina of Time and Majora 's Mask into one review , I will write a review for both games . Both games have been remade for the GameCube , and I own both the original N64 version and the GameCube version . The gameCube versions were released if you bought a GameCube at a certain time and if you pre-ordered the Wind Waker.THE LEGEND OF ZELDA : OCARINA OF TIMEThis game started out as you as the `` Hero of Time '' . You were the only forest child without a fairy , and the Great Deku Tree sent the annoying little fairy to you . When you go to the Deku Tree , he says you must get these Spiritual Stones to open the Door of Time , and a bunch of other crap like that.Sound and Music : 9.5/10.0 This game has one of the best scores in the video game world , and the ocarina songs are very good . 100 % credit to the music makers of all the Zelda Games , these are some great songs . The only problem is you ca n't shut it off . Sometimes it gets annoying , and it does n't help if you are stuck on a level for hours.Graphics : 2004 : 4.0/10.0 1998 : 9.0/10.0 In this day in age the graphics are so good these look like horrible . If this game was released today , everyone would laugh . Back in 1998 , these graphics were the best out there . But the good thing about them is you can see the faces unlike some of those games fromt hat time it made you go blind.Difficulty : 10.0/10.0 This game is HARD ! I beat it barely without a strategy guide , and you can be stuck on levels like the Forest Temple and the freaking Water Temple for MONTHS . If you beat the game with a strategy guide , you take the challenge and fun out of it . You also wo n't have many broken items , like controllers or TV's.Gameplay : 1,000,000.0/ 10.0 It is considered the best game ever , and was the 1998 Game Of The Year . You could do EVERYTHING in this game , and it is very fun doing all those side quests and other crap . This game is like no other . No other game can match this , none of that Final Fantasy or any other RPG match it , it is the best Nintendo game ever made.THE LEGEND OF ZELDA : MAJORA 'S MASKThe game takes a huge turn in Majoras Mask as young Link goes out with Epona from Hyrule . No Ganondorf 's in this game , because it revolves around Majora 's Mask , a mask stolen by this little imp from the Happy Mask Shop guy from OOT . You have three days to get the mask back , but you must keep going back using the Ocarina and the Song of Time.Sound and Music : 9.5/ 10.0 It is like a carbon copy of Ocarina of Time , and the suspensful music is very catchy . The game has great music , ALL ZELDA GAMES HAVE GREAT MUSIC.Graphics : Same As Ocarina of TimeDifficulty : 9.5/10.0 Not as bad as Ocarina of Time , but that does n't mean it is not frustrating and challenging . You ca n't be scared away by the challenge of these games because they are just too great.Gameplay : 10.0/10.0 The whole mask collecting concept is very fun and it a change from beating Ganondorf like in all the other games . You will feel deja vu of Ocarina of Time because the characters are the same , just different . The game is fun and a great challenge . Overall , these games are classical N64 greats !	1
Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is a classic . It should be played by every Nintendo fan and fans who are not big on Nintendo . The Zelda series is infact a big popular series but this one defys all of them . Ocarina of Time is a stand alone Zelda classic . It is not only the best Zelda game but it is possibly the greatest game ever created on a console . The story line is oh so brilliant and the graphics ( even for todays standard ) are unbelievable . Anyone who owns a Nintendo 64 needs this game . This game is pretty old and pretty cheap ( I lost my game so I baught one for 5 bucks at Gamestop ) so it wo n't be hard to find . This game infact shows what the Nintendo 64 is capable of . The game is very well made as you play through a huge world ... well not that huge.. And I will say this.. ( I may be exagerating this though ) But the Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time has one of the best `` boss battle finale '' ending ever..Ubelievable..Graphics in this game a superb . There were parts in the game were I would just stand there and stare at the ocean , houses anything cause it looked so beautiful . I loved how they created the bosses especially the last one and it was amazing how realistic they made the horse look . Nintendo scores big with the graphics . The gameplay is magneficent . I loved how it was all made and done . I really ca n't get into this one , you 'll just have to play this part for yourself ... .The sound is..My god ... It 's beautiful I even downloaded all the songs . I loved the song were your in the temple and you get the Mastersword cause they made that song really well . The music in the farm were Epona is was made extreamly well and was just BRILLIANT ! As I 've stated the story in this game is just plain good , though it obviously has the `` save '' themed plot as you all know and I wo n't really get into the plot since there is already like 500 reviews saying what the plot is about..Sure the game is old and outdated , I guess..But so what..The game is still one of the greatest games of all time . I 'll put it in simple words for you , the game is flawless ! The game has an amazing plot that will suck you in , the gameplay is fun and classic ( as well as riding Epona the horse ) and music is just plain beautiful , the enviroments and atmosphere of the game as just as incredible as the game itself is and as I stated before ... Ocarina of Time is simply the greatest video game ever made ( and if it 's not possible then it has hands down the best video game ever made , no the best video game OF ALL TIME ) ... .Get this game you will not regret it ! 5 out of 5 ! ! ! ! ( if I could I would give it 100000 out of 5 )	1
This and Super Mario 64 are the best games for this console . Now this was the first Zelda game I ever played , and it 's gold cartridge . Now , this is a zelda game that 's good to bring in the newcomer ( or Link to the Past ) . This game is not too difficult , but difficult enough . The story is one of the best stories I 've seen in a video game , very original . The one thing about this game I do n't like are the water dungeons . It 's a trend in Zelda games to make the levels that involve water the hardest part in the game , but it is passable.In conclusion , good game for newcomer and the best storyline to keep you hooked on the series !	1
In this , one of two installments in the Zelda series for the Nintendo 64 , you once again take on the persona of young Link ( or whatever you choose to name him ) , as he embarks on a quest to save the land of Hyrule from the dark forces of Ganon . One of the great conflicts in Nintendo history , second only to that of Mario and Bowser . You start the quest as a boy and end up as a man . Along the way , you will fight many monsters , explore dungeons and temples , rescue a horse ( great for traveling through the world of Hyrule quickly ) , engage in numerous side quests and mini-games , learn many different tunes for your Ocarina , pick up a number of weapons and other helpful items , meet some gorgeous fairies , and in short , have a wonderful gaming experience.As with the other Zelda games , this one is filled with different puzzles of various types , most of which you MUST complete in order to advance in the game . They are engaging , but not too difficult to figure out , for the most part . There are a few , though , that I had a tough time with . Not to fear , though , there is plenty of help out there , both in books and on the internet , to aid you through those difficult spots . The controls are wonderfully intuitive . Navigating through Hyrule is much like controlling Mario in Super Mario 64 ( and the game does , at times , suffer from awkward camera angles like Mario did ) , and there are good tutorials in the game itself that teach you the ins and outs of fighting monsters and defending yourself.The Z-targeting system is excellent , once you get used to it . You do n't really need it for some of the early monsters , but by the time you become an adult , it will be essential . In addition , you have a little fairy buddy , Navi , who continually travels with you and is always willing to give you helpful advice on what to do next after you complete a given task . Navi will also help you with advice on the weak spots of the many different monsters you will encounter throughout the game.As I mentioned before , there are a number of side quests throughout the game . They 're not essential to finish the game , but they are a lot of fun , and some of them will get you prizes that will make the later stages of the game a little easier . One word of advice - when you reach Lake Hylia , be sure and talk to the two scarecrows ! Later in the game , you will be glad you did . Also , be wary of purchasing too many items in the various shops and bazaars . They have many useful items , but they are also VERY expensive , and almost everything in there can be found for free in various nooks and crannies in the game . Also , be wary of Gorons who want to sell you a Giant Sword . Do n't say I did n't warn you ... Although you do not NEED a Rumble Pak to play the game , your gaming experience will be enhanced if you get one . The Pak will be set off whenever Link gets near a secret area , which are sprinkled liberally throughout Hyrule . These secret areas contain goodies that you really do n't want to miss out on.All in all , an excellent game which showcases the abilities of the N64 to great effect . Games like this are why I will always remain a Nintendo fan . But , do n't take my word for it - pick it up ! You 'll be glad you did .	1
THIS GAME IS AS GOOD AS THE SOUNDTRACK AND MAJORA 'S MASK . IT IS ONE OF THE BEST I 'VE EVER PLAYED .	1
Hey all you people , this game is an absolute good . Barely any flaws and it is like you are playing the game in reality . This is a 5 star game.Why , you ask ? This is the proof:1.Gameplay- It takes you a while to master the controls and stuff , but with practice , this would n't be frustrating at all ! 2.Graphics- Great ! As I said , everything is 3-D like the Deku Tree and Link himself . Take a look ! 3.Lifespan- I heard that people who knows Zelda games really well could beat this in a week . But you guys out there that is starting a new adventure , would last forever for no boring parts of the game . There is a lot of words to say , but its worth it.4.Fun-This game is a 99.8 fun game , in my opinion of course . I am stuck on the Deku tree of how to get past the spiders . See , challenging , and fun ! 5.Sound-You got ta be kidding me ! The Sound and music is great ! Different sounds occur in different environments for the better ! Listen Closely ! 6.Overall- This game is an absolute no miss game ! Guranteed . This is a good game who likes RPG , or collects Zelda Games . This is , ( I think ) better than Majora 's Mask . This Game Follows the Legend ! ! ! Honestly .	1
like all zelda games the ocarina of time provides an adventure about link a young hero.in the ocarina of the player takes control of a young boy known as link . right from the start of the game players jaws dropped at the sight of the graphics for 64 bit graphics it looks amazing.as the story progresses players obtain more items and link becomes more of a hero at about 2 thirds through the player becomes an adult and he cant use some of his items which is one the most impressive features in a game iv ever seen . Its about an ancient evil being restored and a child giving up his youth for his country theres nothing bloody wrong with this game its perfect.p.sthis game is why you keep your n64	1
Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time is one of my favorite games ever ! I just love the storyline and the characters , even though Link , Ganondorf and Zelda have been in all of the Zelda games , but this game is the best . The original Legend of Zelda for the Nintendo was okay , but it felt like the game would NEVER end ! I recommend this game to fantasy lovers who also love the idea of a super villan an action-ready hero . This is also one of Nintendo 's classics . Everything a fantasy story needs is right in this game .	1
Im not even that far ( I just got past those guards ) but I can tell this is a classic example of electronic excellence and is a classic that anyone lucky enough to know its out there can discover .	1
I played this game and never wanted to stop . In my opinion , this is the best RPG game ever . It is fun just to play , and run around . The graphics are great , and it is just plain fun . What is also nice is that getting past certain parts of levels are n't very hard , and you do n't get upset playing it.Pros:1 ) Great graphics2 ) Great plot/storyline3 ) Characters look great4 ) Easy figuring out what to do5 ) Just plain funCons:1 ) Ummm	1
Zelda OCT is an action-adventure RPG ( there is debate about this , and some argue Zelda is it 's own genre ) with a combination of puzzles , fighting , and racing . Anyone who enjoys this genre will be enthralled by OCT ( which you can play on several Nintendo platforms including the 64 and Gamecube ) . I still play Zelda OCT 10+ years later on the Gamecube from time to time , it 's that good of a game.Graphics : For the time period , Zelda OCT on the 64 was beautiful and it has stood the test of time FAR better than other older games on consoles . It was the first truly 3D game for a console and set the standard for what video games should look like . If you grew up on newer systems and PC 's , these graphics will look `` blocky '' to you , but the Gamecube has an OCT version with more refined graphics . Still , if you want a `` retro '' video game experience , the N64 Zelda OCT has graphics that are still enjoyable today.Story : The Zelda story is perfect for a video game , as the basic premise is always the same . Link , a young boy ( or young man in newer games ) , is the reincarnated hero of time . He must battle the evil Ganon/Ganondorf to save Hyrule and princess Zelda by using the power of the Triforce.Zelda OCT molds the `` Zelda Story '' into a fantastic tale that will take a least a few months to beat for your first time . The game 's puzzles become progressively more difficult , culminating in the notoriously challenging dungeon - the Water Temple . The story combines several races ( Hylians , Kokiri , Gerudo , Gorons , and Zora ) seamlessly into one large kingdom . The enemies are varied and interesting as well . The Fantasy-Adventure story line is complex and intricate , complete with twists and shocks , time-travel , and genocide . Time affects the characters , and you see that not everyone loses when evil prevails . The story details are amazingly deep , to the point that pictures on someone 's wall and the clothes they wear can fill in some back story of that character . I loved the detail and enjoyed filling in little pieces of the `` back story '' by talking to the NPCs and looking through the first person scope at their tattoos and clothes . The main story is also amazing , with the typical epic sword-clashing adventure ingeniously employed in the Zelda OCT universe . It 's truly a master 's greatest work.Game Play : The 64 had a simple controller for fun game play . There are only a few buttons , A , B , Z , C-pad , R1 , L1 , joystick , and the D-pad . The D-pad is n't needed in Zelda 64 . This limited key selection was used to build an elegant fighting system around a few button combinations . Although B always attacks and A always does `` an action '' , the genius of this system falls in the types of attacks you can do . Depending on the way your character is moving , and whether or not an item is targeted , Link can perform an impressive list of sword attacks ( vertical cut , horizontal slash , diagonal slash , spin attack , thrust , and jump attacks ) . Despite the fact that B , Z , and the joystick are the only buttons that control these moves , Link is easy to control and I never had problems getting Link to perform the combination of moves I desired . Link could cut any sign into 5 unique pieces consistently - that is excellent controller response ! In addition to the perfect synchronization of Link to the game controls ( something newer games like Dark Souls could take a lesson on ) the game play is interesting and varied . Although the main fighting style will be slashing it up with your sword , each monster has a unique weakness that you can take advantage of with a variety of weapons . Link not only totes a one-handed sword and shield , but he also get 's access to a sling shot and deku seeds , boomerang , hook shot , bow and arrows , bombs , deku sticks , deku nuts , and two impressive two-handed weapons : a hammer and a sword . These weapons can all be used in different ways to different effects at various times in the games.Although the game would have been interesting enough with just those weapons , the game is further varied by magic . Link can wield three types of hand magic , as well as three types of magic arrows . This adds another level of monster fighting , where Link tries to find the weakness so he can move in and dice them up.Apart from the impressive array of weapons , Link also packs a varied wardrobe . The stoic hero is far from interested in fashion ( I mean , he runs around in a tunic and tights with a long cap , so he obviously does n't care about his looks ) , so each piece has a specific use . You can mix and match boots and tunics for different benefits . Some bosses can only be beat with the right combination of clothing and shields , and figuring out how to use which items against a difficult boss is part of what makes Zelda OCT a great game.Wait , there 's still more to combat . Apart from the variety of moves and effects Link can muster with his impressive array of items , there is also horseback combat . You can ride around on Epona , a fierce , wild , mare who only listens to you , and shoot things with your bow and arrow . There are also mini games centered around the fun and challenging horseback combat.Summary : Zelda OCT is an excellent Action-Adventure RPG with an epic story line that seamlessly melds a complex kingdom and elegant fighting style into a grand video game . The characters are interesting , with even the most minor sentinels having a back story that you can uncover . The main story is fun to progress through , and you care about a lot of the characters you meet . The controls are excellent and perfectly integrated for fun , non-frustrating , game play . The bosses are challenging , requiring wit to uncover their weakness from the surroundings and circumstances before you can move in and damage them with your sword.Final Note : If the 64 is too retro for you , Zelda OCT has been remade for the Gamecube with newer graphics . However , the Gamecube controller does not integrate as seamlessly as the 64 ( understandably ) so you will miss out on a large part of what made Zelda 64 great . Additionally , there is a 3DS version , but I have n't played that so I really ca n't comment .	1
This is the best game I have ever played.It has very good music , grapics , and the story is great ! I really love this game , but the only really big problem with this game is that it has this one ( long and boring ) temple that is very hard , and ( please ) do n't take this game lightly , the bosses are hard , but the story is so good that you will want to play this game again and again ! But the other Zelda games are lame ! So only ( if you want to ) buy this game and maybe 'the legend Zelda A link to the past ' . PROS : the story is great , It 's a fun game , and the great fairys ( Fairys that will power you up and give you new weapons ) are easy to find . CONS : switching around the camera is a little bit hard , and finding the goldskull tokens ( gold coin like tokens that you win from beating spider monsters ) is easy at the beginning of the game but hard at the end . This is a great game , so I would recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy games , I would also recommend'final fantasyI & II dawn of souls'and'The legend of zelda : the wind waker ' .	1
Although the Final Fantasy series was pretty good , no other RPG can compare to this.With a very long storyline , and if you do n't have a strategy guide handy , there 's a possibility that it might take a while to finish the game completely.The features are just amazing . At some points , you are required to move into the future 7 years , where Link is a full-grown adult , and sometimes back 7 years to advance in your journey . As an adult , some things will have changed . And when day turns to night and vice versa , some things will change that will be different when compared to the same place , only in the daytime.The battles are intense . And as for the boss battles , the bosses have a variety of options that they can do , and to effectively defend , you usually have to be prepared for any & quot ; curves & quot ; that they throw at you.Legend of Zelda : OoT holds a lot of replay value . Even after I 've finished the game , I 'm still having a great time.Overall , Legend of Zelda : OoT is probably one of the best RPGs available . Would be definitely worth buying and would also make a wonderful gift !	1
This is still a great game to own , especialy if you missed it , but the graphics are dated . If you have a GameCube , find a way to get it on there , and be happy you did .	1
THIS IS THE MOST ABSOLUTE SUPERIOR GAME EVER MADE ! You have almost no limits as to what you can do and there is always another secret or trick you can learn ! Not only this but there are no limits to the fun you can have with this game . I enjoy the challenges and puzzles and new items and moves you have to get . If you are going to buy a game for Nintendo 64 this is the game to buy ! ! !	1
This game was a tad on the easy side for the most part , but it was still great fun . One of the best Zelda games . Cool places to explore and neat items to find .	1
Thinking back on the times of Zelda , have got me thinking . The game was absolutely breath taking , I remember how fun and exciting it was , and it was so good , because of the challenge . If there is still anyone who has not played and beaten this game , please get it , it is totally worth the money . Then in 4 or 5 years , you too can think of what a great game Zelda was , but then you will feel bad for neglecting your Nintendo 64 and playing your PS2 , but PS2 's time for neglection will come in a few years also .	1
Although I like the SNES Zelda best , you really ca n't make a game better than this one . Sometimes a game is made that goes above and beyond 5 stars . This game is like that.A vast amount of items , all found in unique ways . Awesome . Lots of giant evil bosses . Awesome . Lots of underground hidden stuff . Awesome . Lots of weird folk to talk to . Awesome . Time travel in a HUGE mythical world . Awesome . Lots of mini-games to play for cool prizes . Awesome . Just so many awesome things packed into this ONE game . I usually only recommend rentals , but a rental would n't do this game justice . You have to buy it , you have to beat it , and you have to find every secret . Live this game , and every now and then , live it again.I 'll also recommend buying some kind of strategy guide , or looking for tips online to find everything . I 've heard that there is a giant monsterous eel-like fish in the pond , but I have yet to catch anything like that .	1
BY FAR ONE OF BEST ZELDA GAMES OF ALL TIME . I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME . WELL WORTH THE MONEY .	1
This is , to me , not only the greatest Zelda game in the series , but also the greatest game I 've ever play.Where to begin ? There is so much in this game that makes it so fun . I absolutely love the side quests . Getting the Biggoron Sword is a race against time , but very rewarding considering you will posess an awesome huge sword that is twice as powerful as the Master Sword ! Another side quest I loved was completing the Gerudo Training Fortress to get the Ice arrows . This will force you to use all your skills and items , and will really put you to the test . I would even venture to say that the Gerudo training temple is more difficult than almost every other dungeon.The ghost hunting side quest is very tough and takes practice and patience . Capture all 10 big poes roaming the field of hyrule and sell them to the strange ghost shop . You will get the 4th bottle ( the hardest to get ) Even the mask salesman side quest is very interesting and unique . While many would n't bother to complete it , but the reward is the very cool and mysterious `` Mask of Truth '' . Furthermore , this side quest is slightly more significant considering that the masks are the focal point in the follow up `` Majoras ' Mask '' .But of course , my favorite side quest is the Skulltula side quest . It is very long and trying , but definitely worth it . This is another side quest many people would n't bother to complete , but completing it does have it 's merits . For example : there is a very profitable rewards system in play . Destroy 10 Golden Skulltulas , and you get the adult wallet ( holds 200 rupees ) . At 20 , you get the stone of agony , which ( when playing with a rumble pack inserted ) will alert the player when a secret is nearby . At 30 , get the Giant 's Wallet and you can carry 500 rupees . At 40 you get Bombchus ( I know , lame ) . At 50 , get a piece of heart . After that , you get nothing more unless you manage to destroy all 100 golden skultullas . Doing this will result in you being able to get 200 rupees every time you visit the house of skultulla . Unlimited money is very cool , although a bit useless at that late a stage in the game.The bosses are great . I wo n't go into great detail , but I 've always loved the fight with Volvagia the lava dragon . There is something so classic and satisfying about watching Link defeat a lava dragon in a volcano with the master sword and hylian shield . Also , the final battle with Gannondorf is a real treat , and I never get tired of firing the magic arrows of light at him . The fight has a very epic quality to it , and the final battle against the horribly mutated Gannon has a nightmarish ambience to it.The temples all have thier own awesome themes , both musically and environmentally . I always thought that the Forest Temple was incredibly imaginative and just stunning . It has the feel of something abandoned to the wild with overgrown vines overtaking the temple , and the open courtyard.The music is top-notch even by today 's standards . Koji Kondo really put together a masterpiece.There is even a sweet element of sadness in Link 's lost childhood , with the loss of his friendship to Saria . The moments where Shiek teaches you a song to warp to a temple always has a reference to a long lost friendship or the somewhat cruel passage of time.The ability to customize adult Link 's appearance is pretty unique and cool where you can choose with color tunic he wears , which sword and shield to wield.In short , this is a wonderful game that will always have a special place in my heart .	1
This game is one of the finest Video games ever produced , while its graphics may be some what dated by today 's standards its epic story and play control are arguably better than many of today 's titles.I can not recommend this game enough .	1
awesome storyline , awesome graphics . perfect game ! great challenge , but not too challenging that you cant beat it . Thanx nintendo for the greateast game ever made ! ! Great game for all ages ! highly recommended ! !	1
This is the best N64 ( R.I.P . ) game I have ever played . It 's full of vast 3D worlds , cool characters , and has a deep storyline . The worlds are huge.Take Hyrule Field , A place which has absolutely nothing to do with the story but going there to get new places , is soooo much fun . When you are n't doing anything and are just playing around , you can have hours of fun running around hunting skullkids and running from those flying spikey flower thingies . When you 're an adult , you can hunt poes ( ghosts ) in the field and get rewards and stuff for it ! Anyway , the story is about a boy named Link who is destined to save his home world , Hyrule , from A powerful wizard . The wizard wants to get ahold of the Triforce , an ancient artifact which has the power to alter the world . He does , and changes the world to a `` hell '' . Link then has to go through many dungeons and meet many people and eventully save his land of Hyrule and return peace . That 's about it . Peace .	1
everything a video game is supposed to be ! Lots visually diverse landscapes and effects , intriguing gameplay and endless oppotunities for exploration within the framework of the game . No boring moments here ! The horse is certainly a nice touch ( being a bit of a horse fanatic myself ) . Provides a fairly lifelike representation of horse riding . Nice soundtrack , and the interactive music play was quite satisfying . All in all a well designed game . Wish they were all this good !	1
Zelda : Ocarina of Time is a well-made game that perfectly blends battle sequences and puzzles . The battles , which can only be won using the right method against the right enemy , are simplified by Z-Targeting , which aims all attacks at the enemy . It takes a long time to beat ( months ) , as any good RPG ( Role-Playing Game ) should . Unfortunately , it constantly and inevitably reminds you of the controls , although they 're pretty easy , in messages which you usually must read . I suggest this for all people , especially those that enjoy a good challenge .	1
I got this game because every person said it was the best game ever . For 1998 it is , but now it 's just good . Not as good as wind waker or twilight princess . The level design is good . Parts are 3d , others are resident evil camera . In short it works okay , but I screwed up many times becaus of it . the graphics were good several years ago , but now they are muddy and polygonal . Aside from that , it 's zelda . Nothing new . If you buy it , do n't expect it to live up to all the hype .	1
There always comes along trend setters that some how can not be bettered ! Zelda is one of those games , its challenging enjoyable adventurous fun ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i loved every minute of it even though at times i wanted root out my hair i have no regrets having this game in my collection , one of the best games ever on 64.even though the 64 era has ended if you are a die hard gamer from time to time you may want to go back this game is definitely worth playing again and again there 's always something you would have miss that you can find the next time around .	1
This title might be the best game ever . The best title for the N64 it is , beyond any doubts.- Graphics : I have n't played much N64 , but , for all I know , this is the best you can get in the plataform . Beautiful enviroment , landscapes , well-designed characters , different places and detailed textures for this plataform . The graphics are hot , I mean it ! And you did n't even need graphics , this game would be great even without them . This game will be forever known because it has changed the world of games with such 3D graphics plus the lock-on camera , this game will be forever reminded because of that . Approved graphics.- Sound : This game has the best soundtrack ever , if you ask me ... Nearly every song in this game wins a 10/10 score . I really want to find a soundtrack for this game , because both the Ocarina songs and the in-game songs are awesome . Characters do n't have voices , except when they scream , when they 're scared and this kind of thing , so the voice acting is n't great . But the sound wins a 9/10 because of the nearly perfect soundtrack.- Fun : This game touches you with a great story , great characters , great songs . You really feel as if you were Link in the beautiful land of Hyrule , and that makes the game so good that you ca n't say it 's not fun . When you feel like the character , you just ca n't stop playing , even in the boring parts ( in other words , the Water and Fire Temples ) . The different times you play and the many secrets hidden ( I mean it , many secrets , I highly doubt you can get them all ! ) makes the game even greater , even more perfect.- Educative : I really do n't know why this game is rated E for Everyone ... I feel like the game has some scary parts ( in other words , the cemitery and the Shadow Temple ) , so it should be rated T for Teen , even though it has no great violence , no red blood ( just green blood sometimes ) . But you parents should n't worry about that . This beauty must be taken to your children.Overall , there 's nothing to say . I do n't know what you 're doing reading my review if you have n't played this game yet . This is one of those games you must beat during your lifetime ( The Wind Waker , the last game in the series , is very good , but it is n't nearly as good as Ocarina Of Time ) . It might take a long time for you to beat it if you 're always busy , because the game is not short , but you must try . It 'll be an unforgettable experience to be Link in Hyrule .	1
When the Nintendo '64 was first introduced to the public in 1996 , the game `` Super Mario '64 '' revolutionized the gaming industry with the introduction of 3-D gaming . However , it was n't until two years later that Nintendo really perfected the 3-D adventure genre with the release of `` The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time '' . `` Ocarina '' is , for lack of a better word , a nearly perfect game in almost every sense . The graphics are great ( for N64 standards ) , the music is fantastic , the gameplay is smooth , and the story is incredibly engaging . Much like the Mario franchise before it , the Zelda franchise ( although already somewhat established on the NES and SNES ) took a simple character ( Mario to Zelda ) , put him in an interesting environment ( Mushroom Kingdom to Hyrule ) , and pits him against fantastic enemies.Of course , perhaps the true greatness of `` Ocarina '' is its balance between the essential gameplay and the sidequests . While this game added more depth ( riding a horse , getting items that , while not vital to the outcome of the game , will help you , etc . ) than any previous game in history , it also was n't too complicated ( see `` Donkey Kong 64 '' ) . In the game , Link has a straight-forward mission and accomplishes each objective in sequence ... you only need to pursue the frivolous things if you so desire.The quirkiness of the game is also charming . Along the way , Link meets a talking tree , gets trapped inside a fish 's belly , befriends the roly-poly Gorons , and liberates temples that each correspond to some sort of natural theme ( forest , ice , water , fire , etc. ) . The first time I ever played `` Ocarina '' , and every time since , I found myself amazed by the crazy and colorful characters that Nintendo came up with for each area of the game.Finally , a great adventure games also needs to have an intriguing plot ( i.e . the reason why the `` Myst '' computer game series was such a big success while its clones failed ) , which `` Ocarina '' delivers superbly . Right away , you are drawn into the storyline that includes rescuing Princess Zelda , defeating the evil Gannondorf , and bring peace to Hyrule again . I know it may sound cheesy , but without an engaging plot the game would have been little more than a sword-slashing RPG with a few puzzles thrown in.Thus , I recommend `` Ocarina of Time '' to all gamers , whether young or old , beginners or experts . The difficulty curve is set as such that you will be able to steadily improve your skills in time to defeat each obstacle before you , while enough really challenging side quests exist that you can also hone your skills to a `` tee '' if so desired . So whether you want to fire up the old N64 , dust off the old Gamecube ( for which a version of `` Ocarina '' was released ) , or buy the game on the Virtual Console of your Wii , do so with confidence that you will instantly be charmed by this amazing work of video game creation .	1
Ok , alot of people hate this game - but i cant complain with it.Although some of the levels are annoying ( i hate the 2nd level of india with a passion ) at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider ( the 2nd , and 4th onwards ) should be named `` City Raider '' the graphics are kinda yellowish . the lighting can be harsh . but its a lengthy game - took me almost 6months to beat ( partially cause i jumped triliogy installments ) but its an ok game . its better than the 2nd , and way better than all the others afterwards - but doesnt messure up to the original .	1
I own a playstation but i hardly think it 's that great a console . Blame it on the N64 for their exceptional games- but i do believe that the Playstation may have some hope left in it.Well Tomb Raider 3 is a good example . This is a huge game with a lot of 3D explosions and gunfire and lots of jumping . Also if you have something against people and animals , then you wo n't be dissappointed either.You also get to blow uo raptors and a T-rex by the way . Despite being a solid title , i beta the game long ago and have since went on to other 'pursuits ' like Zelda . I 'm not gon na compare the two , mind you , but let 's say that while TL3 is a really good game and somewhat long- it 's not gon na make a classic or give Mario or Sonic a run for their money.Simply put , all the TR games are long and filled with adventure . Lara 's cute and i like this game but it 's just not gon na be what i 'm looking for long-term.It 's also tedious to have to play through it again . I think it 's a mood-game ; you 're likely to bore through the WHOLE thing when you 're in the mood , and that sounds extreme.But as you can tell 4 stars is saying alot cause this game definetely restores my faith in the playstation and it 's over-rated games.If Lara were to make the jump to the Dolphin- i would n't be surprised ; Tomb Raider always had the potential to be a great game ; it 's just that sometimes- you need a lot of patience and perhaps , this will fit nicely.Finally , the graphics and the sound are passable . Levels are detailed but heavily pixelated and sound sounds cranky or too soft at times.But given any new Lara Croft game , i 'll be excited and i 'm looking foward to the new game after the last one last Christmas .	1
Yes , TR3 is a bear ( so to speak ; - ) . E.g. , there 's a particular spot at the very outset of the game , hiding under the leaves , which you have to make a blind leap to find , and would never guess is there if someone had n't told you . But that is in the grand old tradition of Adventure -- the one point remainder ( a postage stamp , usually , in the old days , or dropping the magazine in a particular place when you 're at your wit 's end ) . The impossible puzzle drags you out of the game and forces you to kickstart your social life , and ASK REAL PEOPLE for the answer . Very legitimate . Same as , `` Do n't kill monks at Barkhang Monastery '' ( TR2 ) , and do n't kill monkeys either ( TR3 ) ! This game is a heckuva lot of fun on a great many levels OTHER THAN gameplay . It 's full of visual splendors that rival the next to last discontinuous maze of TR2 , and I enjoy everything about it ... except playing . The game part is tedious , unfair and annoying beyond belief . But it 's a real collector 's item , especially on PlayStation 2 ( be sure to keep your PS1 memory card ! ) , and in our family , it 's in its second generation of total immersion .	1
This is a great game to own I have and I beaten It ten times and I sill play it the level 's are pretty to look at the background 's are ok it 's colorful and a little rich here and there.Play through five world 's there are:1 South Pacific2 Antarctica3 Area 514 London5 IndiaNew Moves , and Vehicles : Speed Dash , Monkey swing , kayak and quad bike help Lara out of tricky situations.New weapons like:1 Grenade Launcher2 Desert Eagle3 Rocket LauncherIn the game fine the ancient meteor rumored to have life giving power 's .

For a few reasons new people of the Tomb Raider games should not start out on this one , unless they are really skilled at video games . Seriously I beat Tomb Raider One and Two and even Four with a heck of a lot more ease than I did with part Three . So no I would not recommend this to new gamers but people that want a challenge this is the game to get.One of the biggest reasons this game is so hard are the secrets . They sometimes put the secrets in places you would never even notice . So I advise , if you want the secret level at the end of this game , to get a strategy guide cause 99 % of the time you can not find all the secrets on your own . The secret level though is not neccessary to beat the game at the end , and not truly worth the bother to me . I was so happy and exhausted to just finally beat the game that I could have cared less about a secret level and would n't have wanted to play it anyway.And that was another problem . How hard the ultimate boss at the end was . I thought the dragon in part two was difficult- at least when it hit me I did n't automatically lose . With the ultimate boss in part three if you get too close he will spew this stuff at you and right away you drop dead . It was difficult and frustrating and took me forever to beat . Yet I can not say it is impossible , for I did at last beat it , but it is NEARLY impossible and will take you most likely a long while like I . What I did was the best , I got out my rocket launcher and just kept blowing away at him while jumping around and around that platform . I definitely would not stand there or get too close make sure you are as far away as possible for he will not spew that stuff at you unless you are close.Then I guess the next hardest part of part three was just the levels themselves . Some parts of the game were very difficult and without the strategy guide next to me I would have encountered many , many dead ends or stepped into a place that just ended Lara . It grew pretty frustrating at times and the worst part of it all is that you can not save anytime you like- so unless you cheat and get a load of crystals you will do some backtracking.Worst part of the game : Nevada- In this part all the medi packs you saved up , all the ammo you saved up before- the guards take it all away from you so you have to go through the levels finding your guns and picking up as many medi packs as you can . It grew to be very difficult and I hated that part of the game . The only good part of this level was at the very end when you got to see a few alien bodies.Best parts of the game : South America- For its lovely scenes and it was n't impossible to beat . I also liked the dinosaurs they put in , it reminded me of Tomb Raider One all over again.And London- London was fun as well I enjoyed playing there , with what looked like the same Sphinx- like statue placed in this part as was in Tomb Raider One , except this time you do n't go into this one.So- So Levels : India- Sometimes a challenge that got on my nerves but then the rest of the time it was just normal Tomb Raider stuff , a little boring of a level compared to the others . The statues coming alive were pretty scary though.Anartica- Creepy part of the game . At the ending part of all Tomb Raider games there is some breed of creatures you have to fight- in part one it was what looked like animals turned inside out- in part two she fought what looked like action figures- and now in part three she has to fight mutants . Creepy definitely . Got a little scary sometimes . And this part of the game was not too hard , but indeed I was always kept on alert with those mutants . One problem I hated in this part though was the carts- those mine carts drove me crazy I was always dying in them . Just keep working at it though , eventually you get around those corners without dying.Overall I give this game a 3.5 to a 4 star rating . It is definitely not as good as the first two , just a heck of a lot more frustrating but indeed it was a challenge and Lara Croft is still a fun character to play with so I ca n't hate this game , but I definitely will not play it again for a long time . It is just too stressful and hard of a game to play all the time.Do not think Tomb Raider Four is just as stressful and nearly impossible- Part Four is a lot better and I recommend it highly .	1
Never played this when I was a kid , but decided to purchase a classic game as I 'm trying to build my own personal PS1 collection .	1
Turok 2 : Seeds of Evil is the sequel to Turok Dinosaur Hunter that not only surpasses that game in it 's greatness but is my most favorite game in the series of four games that came out on the N64 . Everything that made the original such a great game to play was improved upon , especially in the way of graphics . With the expansion pak , graphics had 'almost ' a Playstation 2 quality to them . It 's something that showed with this game . It showed in the textures of the environments , the details of the architecture , lighting effects and other eye candy . The game was also bigger and better than any other game , with the exception of Zelda : Ocarina of Time , in it 's 32 meg cartridge . As you 've probably read in the courtesy review , it 's been stated to have over 45 hours of playtime . While I do n't know about that , personally , as I had n't checked where I stand within the game..one thing I do know is it 's one lengthy meaty game to sink your teeth ( playtime ) into.While Turok 2 : Seeds of Evil stood in the shadow of Rare 's Goldeneye during it 's release , Turok 2 still stands the test of time in terms of gameplay and is one game every Nintendo fan should add to their collection . If not for the fact that it had a killer storyline and an awesome arsenal of weapons to play with , then for the fact it was an absolute beauty of a game .	1
This game is fun . The visuals are impressive and the guns are frickin ' cool and some fun multi-player . Play this game because you deserve something special . Unless youre a Dragon Ball Z fan .	1
Anyone who likes 007 would enjoy this game . great first person shooter ! I will enjoy playing this game . The game play is a bit strange and hard to get use to because the aim and movement joysticks should be switched . The c pad on the N64 controller is hard to move with . Great game with practice !	1
Turok 2 when I was younger as a kid was amazing , no parents told me I was not aloud to play it because they never actually played it themselves to know . The graphical content and gore was stunning to my 5 year old eyes . The first level took me forever to beat and I only beat it once . Plus I did n't have a controller pak . Then came the day I bought it again for my n64 , nothing looks more sexy than Turok 2 in a green nintendo 64 . The first time I ever beat it and it took as long as it did to beat a metroid game and there are only 6 levels . Weapons in old games to begin with were always amazing . I was always able to hold as many as they would let me . Such as doom , Turok , South park , Armorines , perfect dark , etc . Then new games came along and ruined everything that is great about Fps . Sure they have better graphics and frame rate . But they are all the same to be honest . Emulators sucks ass I do n't care if its rgb or not . But just old games from dos to the beginning game cube fps 's are all I got . But something about the way a n64 looks and the way the graphics look on it just make me love it so much . To me it 's the best looking system and has the best looking games . Turok tops it all ! Way ahead of its time it set the standard of what the n64 was capable of . Turok 2 is on pc and n64 . The n64 game had stencil bits and made the game take a hit in frame rate . Stencil bit shadows were a new thing in 98 so iguana tried it out . In my honest opinion I would n't have even cared if the shadows were just the classic circle or just no shadows at all . Still it is stunning the n64 could handle what was thrown at it . The AI in the game was the most fascinating thing I have ever seen in a game and still is . They are smart and fight one another ( really fun to watch ) I found the game to run best in Hi-res-LB and looks the best as well . The weapons are still the coolest weapons in any game on the face of this planet and all of them are uniquely different . My favorite weapons are the Tek Bow , Shotgun , War-blade , Razor-wind , Cerebral bore , Plasma Rifle , Mag-60 , Grenade launcher , the kick ass Charge Rifle ( ONE OF THE BEST LOOKING WEAPONS ) , Firestorm Cannon ( like a mini-gun but different and bad ass sounding ) , Nuke , Flamethrower ( The first fire to actually show 3D even in almost all games on n64 ) , and the torpedo Launcher ( because you can go through water faster ) . Music has always been one of my favorite things when it comes to games because the music sets the mood and Turok 2 has the best music in any n64 game I have ever heard , sorry Perfect Dark your music and K7-Avenger are great to but Turok is to bad ass . Iguana seemed to like it so much and acclaim that , that the music is in all Turok games as well as Vexx and Armorines and more have some similar sound . The multiplayer in Turok 2 to me is absolutely stunning ( I run that in low-res ) and is just as good as Goldeneye , Perfect Dark , The world is not enough , and Turok Rage wars . Quite a few games ran on the Turok engine as well . Armorines ( a amazing game ! Uniquely different yet just as awesome ) , and South Park ( not many liked this game but to me it 's like a mixture of Doom+Turok=South park ! ... The multiplayer is good to just do n't go above 2 players . ) So you see Turok 2 was used in many things and is an amazing game . Once you play it you will wish iguana and acclaim still existed . They were the company that developed and distributed games with their say so . Making their games unique . Most hated their games but they never looked at the work they did . Extreme G2 for example had so much done to it that it to suffered frame rate and certain levels were unplayable in single player Grand Prix but in time trials they all ran smooth and helped with remembering everything . Extreme g2 to me is the best out of the series . I have almost every game by Acclaim and love every game ( except turok 3 , its a good run the first time but compared to dinosaur hunter and seeds of evil it is crap ) . So Turok 2 is amazing ! if you want to try it get it now ! on n64 or even on PC ! You will love the game and see all the death animations and creative designs and levels ! Turok is the greatest fps try them all ! ( your own risk for 3 but a good to the collection ) Dinosaur Hunter 1 amazing smooth game great n64 game , the first fps on n64 . Seeds Of Evil 2 Worthy sequel and is amazing in graphics and game play . Shadow Of Oblivion a okay game for the first run but great for the collection . Rage Wars the true sequel or attachment to Turok 2 and has great multiplayer and just as bad ass guns . Evolution fantastic remake of the first Turok starring Tal'set and has amazing weapons and is the biggest game of them all featuring over 14 chapters and has awesome multiplayer . Turok PC,360 , ps3 I played it on 360 , Runs on the Unreal Engine ( which is bad ass ) a great game with good weapons ( Why I liked it is because I was quick and accurate , I run faster than slow ass call of duty and has worthy death animations like Turok 2 but not as good and not as good music , awesome multiplayer [ if anyone is on ] and a good campaign ) . These are the Turok games ! Which started out as comics and became life and were playable . Get Turok 2 you will enjoy it ! And bring a few friends over ! It is A True Turok Game and is worth being played even in todays cliche fps trigger happy CoD fans .	1
Love this game . So much fun . It is even better with the cheats . One of the best games for the N64 . I can play this for hours apon hours . I love this game .	1
This is a great game if you are prepared to accept that this game really was n't meant for the N64 . The game has numerous slowdowns even if you have an expansion pak on the N64 . Not everywhere , but anytime there are a bunch of explosions or a whole horde of enemies are following you then you will have some sorta slowdown . Now onto all the pros of this game.I witnessed this game before I played it . My friends were playing it when I was like 11 or so and this game scared me to death . I thought Reptoids and Endtrails were the scariest monsters ever . Capturing children not knowing what they were going to to do to them . This game saids its rated `` M '' , but you really should play this when you are a kid . It 's a whole lot scarier when you 're a kid . Not so much when you 're an adult . Either way this game gives off a very unsettling atmosphere . If you want a mindless shooter like the original Turok this game is not for you . The antagonists actually have a story this time.The enemy AI is very realistic . The monsters react with the precise speed and vitriol that makes sense.The graphics were probably the best graphics on the N64 . Again , the N64 version has slowdowns , but at the time these were the best graphics we 've ever seen in a video game and I still quite beautiful in retrospect.This game also have a variety of very orginally designed monsters . The raptors and Purrlin are still here , but they are way cooler and better equiped this time . You fight genetical engineered dinosoids , zombies , Purrlin ( big apelike creatures ) , insects , spiders , cave dwellers ( The Blind Ones ) , worms , a fat bitch that comes near the end , and even robots . All look bad ass looking and ready to kill you.The death animations are some of the best death animations ever made in the history of video games . In this game you litteral can blow someones head off , or a limb , or a whole torso.The weapon choice is also top notch . I 'm sorry , but the Cereberal Bore was the coolest weapon ever thought of . That 's just my opinion . There 's just nothing better than locking onto an enemies head , shooting a bore , the bore drains the cereberal fluid , and then explodes when it reaches the center . Coolest weapon ever made . The Razorwind is also cheap as hell.I really can go on and on about how good this game is . This is probably my favorite FPS next toDoom both which are tied for first .	1
After playing `` Turok : The Dinosaur Hunter '' for ten minutes , I realized I had a great game at hand . It was like Mortal Kombat , except in a shooting-game . Blood everywhere , amazing enemies and weapons , and a good , good time . And I 'll admit this ; I do n't actully play the Turok games . No , I 'm sorry , I do n't . It 's not that their hard , or boring , but I do n't play them ... well , not without the cheats at least . As soon as I find out a new Turok game 's coming , I get on the internet , go to Happypuppy.com , and find the Master Cheat . Yeah , it 's pretty low , but it 's fun to go in these blood-soaked shooter games . And the second one is no exception . I played this game without cheats for a few hours , made up my mind , and decided it was great , and would be even better with cheats.Half an hour later , I came back with the Master cheat in my hand , which is `` BEWAREOBLIVIONISATHAND '' , or , if you break it down , `` BEWARE OBLIVION IS AT HAND '' . Within minutes , I had an amazing arsenal , all maps , invincibility , and more by my side . The weapons ... well , let 's just say the first Turok ca n't touch them . You have the usual knife and bow and arrow , pistol , shotgun , and the rest , but you now also have a nuke , pod layer ( which lays bombs on the ground and they explode on contact ) , a machine gun ( as the first had , but this one 's much better ) , the Cerebrial Bore ( the most gory weapon of all . It launches out a little ball , and it goes straight for the enemies head . When it gets there , it starts sucking and draining blood form their head , then , after 5 second , it explodes , and takes the enemies head with it ) , my personal favorite , the Razor Wind ( a shield with sharp edges on it . You throw it and it cuts up all enemies in it 's path , then come right back to you . It can chop off just about any limb you throw it at ; the head , the legs , and the arms ) , and another physical weapon , the War Blade . The name says it all.Overall , this game is a vast improvement , and is the best yet ( but that might change as soon as I play `` Evolution '' ) . The graphics are great , awesome story , vast , detailed enviroments , and some hot blue chick that always pops up . What more could you ask for ?	1
`` Turok 2 : Seeds of Evil '' has a lot to love about it . The music rocks . The graphics are still quite good for N64 standards ( especially if you have the Expansion Pak ) . It controls just fine ( get used to the C-button controls ) . There 's some good multiplayer . It 's a bloody , gory mess . And the weapons are freaking awesome ( just wait till you see the Cerebral Bore ) .But there 's a big problem with it : DESIGNI 'm not talking about the art direction or graphical look . `` Turok 2 '' is still a good-looking game with gruesome enemies and solid lighting effects . But these levels are confusing as all hell , with the exception of the 1st one . If we had a better story to go along with it , then maybe there 'd be a reason to plow through . But for whatever reason , Acclaim & Iguana decided to force the player to scour every inch of the 6 levels , and if you 're stuck , you 're stuck for good.You will be required to light beacons , find keys , and rescue children . Again , Level 1 is n't so bad , but Levels 2-6 are gon na be a pain in the butt if you get lost . The map you 're given sucks . And to make matters worse , you ca n't leave or quit levels once you 've selected them.But if you 're not too proud to grab a strategy guide or go online , then `` Turok 2 '' will be more fun than perhaps some of us had back in 2000 . The combat is still a blast ( although the final Primegen boss is impossible without cheat codes ) . The presentation is sharp . And the Turok world is still very unique from today 's overload of military/war shooters . `` Turok 2 '' was one of the N64 's most critically-acclaimed titles for the console , rightfully so . But be warned , it 'll test your gaming logic more than you expect .	1
When I heard about turok 2 comming out I was so friggin phyced ! I wasnt dissapointed.It was even bettter than the first . It wasa little sci fi for me though . And what was up with turok ... He looked so young . I really didnt get the story . If you get the cheats its even better ! Even more awsome weapons for you touse . You kick alien ass and take names ! This is one of my favorite sequals for a video game.Its very original . The game is frustrating without cheats butits really fun and cool . Its pretty much as violent as thefirst one.I love this game ! Great graphicsGreat gameplayGreat story ... .Kina confused with turok bein youngOVER ALLITS A GREAT GAME ! WAY TO GO ACCLAIM !	1
no idea to say about that have same with twisted metal 2-4 and twisted metal small brawl I have n't play for long time	1
I believe that any twisted metal game you purchase will be fun and exiting because , the fundamentals are the same throughout all the games . Seek out enemy , kill and move to the next level , and the cool thing is you are using cars to blow things up and getting to destroy others . Also the levels are locations that we all reconciles , so that adds to the fun . I like twisted metal 3 because they brought more of a 3D look to cheaters , locations , car , weapons and added new cheaters to the story as well as embellish on the story line . Yes the graphics are not all out there however , the game play is the same and for the most part is stood true to the twisted metal franchise that was created in the beginning . If you love twisted meat at all you will love this one . I have played all twisted metal games and for the most part I do like them all . And this one I really do like very much .	1
thank you for having this game and in its good conditionyou have increased my collection of games by one	1
This game is not receiving the credit it deserves . It 's a good quality game . I had a blast playing it . Far more than i did with Twisted Metal 1 and 2 . The whole series is awesome and , to me , theres not a bad twisted metal game .	1
How can anyone not like this game ? I do n't know about you guys but i still like to play this as weel as twisted metal 2 , even though i just got an 360 , i will still play this whenever	1
A lot of people dismiss this game because of the different developers but i personally thought it was a good game . It was the first twisted metal i have played and when i played twisted metal 2 i thought it was a little better but not much .	1
works just fine . old school just the way it should be . a huge improvement from twisted metal II . Still old school graphics but it still is fun to play .	1
NOT terrible , like the other reviews say ... .it 's solid ... just not as good as parts 1 and 2 ... .but at this point in time , you should be playing the newest version released ... look it up ! !	1
this is one old school fun game to fight against your friends . you can not create any thing . hours of fun from royal rumble to regular matches and there is quite a bit of people to play as .	1
This is and was the best wrestling game ever and the big bonus is it 's WCW/NWO not WWE so all the wrestlers are awesome !	1
THQ 's second American release is a huge leap in graphics from the original `` World Tour '' Dozens of wrestlers from the NW0 , WCW , Raven 's Flock , cruiserweights , heavyweights and some of which are made up for the game . The great thing about this game is it was back in WCW 's hay-day when it had talented wrestlers , like Jericho , Benoit , Malenko and Raven , more talent means more moves , more moves means more fun . The only real modes other than battle royals , and handicapped matches are a series of championship tournaments to go through in a specific weight / talent class . There are incredible looking arenas even with an isle to brawl in and weapons that you can pull from the crowd and bring into the ring . The unfortunate part about this game is that it is dated , and it moves very slowly compared to Wrestlemania2000 and No Mercy .	1
This is my all time favorite wrestling game ever made I really enjoy this game alot the modes you have are exhibition tag team special matches like 2 on 1 you have also a 40 player battle royal which to me is my all time favorite feature in this game what so ever winning the titles in this game is alot of fun and to me this game is alot better than the overrated smackdown here comes the pain and it is alot easier than that game as well I do n't get why people say smackdown here comes the pain is so great when in reality it sucks because the ai in season mode is very cheap and I hate ai like that but in this game on easy mode the ai is way to easy but to me this game is just awesome and I still play this game alot to this day I never get tired of it .	1
Greatest wrestling game ever , to this day . Not only does it feature the best wrestlers from the greatest time period in all of wrestlings history , but that greatness translates into the game . Fun , and very real controll like features . Ca n't say enough how great the game is .	1
I always hated the WCW . I was playing Warzone , Attitude and WWF titles for a long time . Then I somehow ended up owning this game and I inteneded to dissmiss it , but I found myself playing it more and more every day and eventualy loved it . I was happy to hear THQ got the rights to WWF and went from this to Wrestlmania and then the best game on the 64 NO MERCY . However , this is the foundation of where it started and I respect it for that . It brought a lot of awsome memorys and entertainment on hot summer nights . I recomend No Mercy over this , but this original version deserves your respect .	1
I should probably review some modern games while I 'm here , but I 've been kinda GTA'ed out recently , so I decided to put the PS3 away for a minute and bring up some old games from the past to see if they 're just as fun as I remember them as . One of those titles was WCW/nWo Revenge.Released during WCW 's heyday ( and roughly a few months before WCW 's eventual downfall ) , the game showcases an astoundingly deep roster for game that came out in the 90s . A total of 63 WCW/nWo wrestlers were divided up into different factions : WCW 1 ( main-event wrestlers ) , WCW 2 ( mid-card wrestlers ) , WCW 3 ( opening match wrestlers ) , WCW 4 ( Cruiserweight wrestlers ) , nWo White , nWo Red , and Raven 's Flock . Further , there were roughly a dozen or so other wrestlers listed under the imaginary EWF and DAW leagues included in the game ; these wrestlers were modeled after Japanese wrestling stars but had their likenesses changed to avoid copyright issues.The controls of the match are simple enough for anyone to jump in and learn , but you have to understand the psychology of wrestling ( and use the controls accordingly ) if you want to go deep into the championship modes of the game . Players use the B button to strike , A button to initiate a grapple , the d-pad to move , and the joystick to either taunt or execute a special move . The player can differentiate between a weak strike/grapple and a strong strike/grapple by holding the respective button down until the move is executed . The more `` worn down '' your opponent is , the better chances you have of successfully hitting them with a strong attack . Yet if you try to initiate a strong grapple on an opponent who 's not worn down , they 'll likely reverse the attack and counter with one of their own . So much like real wrestling , you have to wear your opponent down with the weak attacks until you move up and hit them with the strong ones ( and also like wrestling , it 's a good idea to generate a response from the audience by letting out a taunt while your opponent 's down . ) Once your spirit meter is full , you can strike an opponent with a special move by initiating a strong grapple and then moving the joystick ( or alternately using the joystick when on the turnbuckle if the finisher 's an aerial maneuver . ) The controls also allow you to run , leave the ring , block/counter an attack , dodge an attack , and set your focus on another opponent if you 're involved in a handicap or tag team scenario.The game has several modes : Championship , Exhibition , and Special Modes . The exhibition mode is a singles or tag team match where the player can face either the computer , a friend , or a few friends since the game supports up to 4 players . The championship modes allow the player to compete for the WCW TV Championship , the WCW Cruiserweight Championship , the WCW Tag Team Championship , the WCW United States Championship , and the grand-daddy of them all , the WCW World Heavyweight Championship ( affectionately referred to as the Big Gold Belt . ) While the path to the Television titles and the Cruiserweight titles are n't terribly challenging , you will need to bring your `` A '' game when competing for the higher-tiered titles ( or you can dial the difficulty down to Easy , either or . ) The special modes essentially allow the player to engage in specialty handicap or battle royal exhibition matches ; with the former allowing for 2-on-1 or 3-on-1 battles while the latter will have 4 competitors fighting each other in the ring until one 's eliminated , with the option to allow up to 40 contestants to enter the match . You 're also given a mode where you can customize the given wrestlers to either have different names or to have them wear different costumes.The upside to the game is that it 's still fun to play , even 15 years later . As I said earlier , anyone can pick up the controllers and jump in , while the subtle nuances of the game do n't take much effort to figure out as you go along . The soundtrack is limited but I do n't ever think anyone confused WCW 's entrance music with the music that Jim Johnston ( of WWE fame ) has released over the years ( with the only exception being Goldberg 's theme . ) The graphics were a work in progress considering where the franchise was at by the time WWF No Mercy was released , but it was still leaps and bounds better than what most expected from the gameplay of other systems at the time ( as a reminder , this game was released for a console that is three generations removed from what 's available today . ) If there was one drawback from the game , it 's the limited gaming options that exist . Once you beat the championship mode , that was essentially it as far as beating the game was concerned . There were no steel cage match options , tag teams were limited to 2-on-2 action , and the create-a-wrestler option would n't be introduced until THQ/AKI began releasing titles for WWF . Other gripes I have are that you ca n't seemingly control whether or not someone interferes on your behalf and the fact that the CPU can `` Hulk up '' their spirit meter rather effortlessly while the player has to do all the little things right to make that possible.With all that said , however , the game 's fun factor makes it a legitimate `` must have '' for wrestling fans and should be considered by N64 fans who are looking for a beat-em-up button-masher where the top prize is the WCW Championship . I recommend this to N64 gaming fans , wrestling fans , and people who watched wrestling `` when it was cool . ''	1
I remember when this game first came out . It was mind blowing as to just how awesome it was ! It had basically anyone & everyone you 'd ever want in a wrestling game ( minus some legends ) . And if you had 4 controllers & 3 friends ... ..It was going down for hours ! Well , this game is still pretty cool despite it 's age . The . Graphics obviously do n't look as awesome as they used to . But still , they could look worse ... .And the gameplay is still easy to pick up & enjoy ! Infact , I wish the wrestling games of today could get the controls simple & fluid as on this N64 game . If they could remake this game w/ an expansive create a player/wrestler and simple controls . I 'd easily buy that too ! I highly recommend this to anyone that is a game collector . Or anyone who has n't played games of this era , but are getting older games . There is a crap load of characters , cool match modes . And as I stated earlier get controllers & some buddy 's .	1
Great Game One Of The Best Of N64 Next To Paper Mario And Zelda OoT Ofcourse Anyway Buy It If You Have A N64 And Also Get wCw Nitro For PS1 Anyway BUY THIS AND NITRO AND THUNDER ALL FOR PS1	1
I had purchased quite a few games trying to find the one I remember . This game is fun and has a good roster of characters . The moves are simple and the game is fun hours on end . A good way to relax after a tiring day .	1
I loved this game when it first came out , and to this day it 's one of my favorites . The wrestlers ( most of them anyway ) have a whole lot of moves , and they are not all the same for every wrestler . The inclusion of the `` real '' wrestlers ' signature moves is very cool . One of the things I especially like about the game is the number of wrestlers on it . There are 62 of them -- - that 's a lot more than a lot of later wrestling games have . A few of them are locked at the start , but they 're not really that hard to unlock -- - at least not with the difficulty level on `` easy . '' Several wrestlers who were later on the Legends games ( Hogan , Macho Man , Sting , Bret Hart , Steiners , and others ) are here . Some of the wrestlers are made-up , or at least I assume they are . The graphics are good . The wrestlers are blocky , but the `` real '' wrestlers ' faces are very realistic . The play control is very good -- - a lot better than the play control on World Tour . The 40-man Battle Royal is really cool . There are several different arenas , which is kinda neat but ( in my opinion ) does n't really do that much for the game . The sound effects and music are ( in my opinion ) not great but good enough . The wrestlers do n't have individual entrance music , but oh well -- - no biggie ( again , my opinion ) . There is no commentary , but that 's fine with me because I always turn off the commentary on games , anyway . One of my fave game features is the Costume Change mode . This mode lets you take wrestlers and put other wrestlers ' outfits on them , and lets you edit the colors of the outfits . That 's fun ( I think so , anyway ) ! You can even change the wrestlers ' names , but why would you ever really want to do that ( unless maybe somebody [ like Giant ] has changed their name in real life ) ? There is n't much if anything about this game that I have any major complaints about . Sure , it 's dated now , but I still find it as fun as I did back in 1998 ( I think that 's when it first came out ) . Just because something is old now , that does n't mean it is n't still good !	1
Tomb Raider 3 is the hardest of the Tomb Raider series ( at least in my opinion ) . It has a very complicated plot , decent graphics , and a moderate amount of action -- although I have not completed it myself . It could use more action and less puzzles , however . The biggest problem with it that I 've faced is that it has a lot of bugs and errors throughout . Some errors can be fixed without a lot of hassle , others can be fixed but with a lot of hassle , and some ca n't be fixed at all . Myself , I do n't have a lot of patience , I just play the game because I love challenges . So , unless you have a LOT of patience , or enjoy tough challenges like I do , TR3 is not for you .	1
Better than TR2 for sure . It has some brain taxing levels filled with puzzles , secrets and some enemies . I 'm glad to see they have cut back on the enemies and focused on the puzzles and scenery . They have definatly picked some good locations for the game , with brilliant details that are authentic in style . Unfortunatly that is where the authenticity ends.The level makers should have done some research on these locations and made them more like they are in real life . OK , I know it 's an adventure game that is meant to be fantasy , but I do feel they could have checked things out first.Examples ; India dos n't have pyrannas ( Brazil does ) , the Ganges dos n't end in a pond , St.Pauls Cathedral looks nothing like that ( that must be the worst rendition of it yet ) , the British Museum is not next to the Lloyds building , and Area 51 is more spacious than that ( I saw it on a TV programme , I swear ) . I wo n't judge the Pacific levels though , I do n't know enough about them . They realy do need to watch their locations more.Enjoyable game though .	1
Yes , I did find this a bit cumbersome . I wanted a more puzzle oridented game . I kept getting stuck in seemingly absurd situations and go to a walk-through forum to make progress . One of the comforts is that a cheat code can take you to the next level , if you get frustrated through not being able to figure out some trick to advance . Lara is a great character . But in this game she is faced with too many obstacles and impossible-to-discover secrets to make the game truly enjoyable .	1
i loved the first and second tomb raider 's and this one is just amazing . i love the story , the graphics are good , the gameplay is really easy , and it 's relatively easy . i know that many people say that this game is way too hard , but there seriously mistaken , it 's really not that hard . it 's much like the other tomb raiders . i still play it , it 's such a good game.get this if you liked the other tomb raider games . and pay no attention to the reviews that give this game 1,2 or even 3 stars ! just stick to that 4 's and the 5's.oh , one more little thing ... if you have vista or a laptop you may have some sound effect problems , but it usually fixes itself after you play it for a few hours .	1
For those of you who have n't played Super Mario 64 , I would like to say on behave of all of us that have , `` your truly missing out ! '' Super Mario 64 was the very first video game I ever played on my Nintendo 64 , so my review could be a little biased , but I just recently replayed the game from start to finish and it still has not lost its touch . It 's a game for people that love adventures , puzzles , shooting , and the occasional flying . It never seizes to get old and the graphics are as good as they can get for the Nintendo 64.The object of the game is simple , Bowser has kidnapped Princess Peach , and you , Mario ( the greatest Plummer in the world ) , must save her . Bowser is hiding somewhere in the castle and you must find him by collecting all of the hidden stars scattered throughout various paintings that give Mario his power . To find Bowser , you must climb to the top of the tower . Each floor requires a certain number of stars that have to be collected before you can move on . Every painting that has stars in them are magical paintings that Mario can jump through to transport himself to a different world were he can explore for stars.Overall , I rank the game a 9/10 for its creativity and several different ways it keeps players focused and entertained . The makers of Mario did a fantastic job integrating so many different aspects of gaming , which in turn made it so great . I hope that whoever is reading this can come to their senses and BUY THIS GAME !	1
Even though this game is almost 4 years old-it is still one of the best games that the N64 has to offer . Why ? Well dear reader I will tell you why . SUPER MARIO 64 is a gaming revolution , it was the game that everyone had to have . It took Mario into a whole new atmosphere . The world that is inside Princess Peach 's ( aka Princess Toadstool ) castle is immense and highly imaginative . Although the graphics may seem a little bit dated ( it was a launch game remember that ) it is still a sight to see . As far as play control goes , it is a bit difficult to get the hang of moving Mario around , but once you get used to it then controlling Mario is a breeze . In fact it is some of the best playcontrol that a game has to offer . The Super Mario 64 storyline is familiar to Mario fans but at the same time a touch refreshing . Yes Peach is captured but she is being held prisnor in her own castle ( in a picture in fact ) , and one of the funnest parts of the game is hanging out outside . One of my problems is that Luigi is not in the game , in fact no mention of him is made either . Nintendo should have left the Mario Party franchise alone and focused on creating a Super Mario 64 2 , but alas they did n't . So if you own a Nintendo 64 and do n't have this title , or are thinking of buying a N64 , then get Super Mario 64 because it is by far a true gaming experience .	1
1996 was a fairly important year in the realm of video gaming . The Super Nintendo Entertainment System dies out in the United States . Diablo comes out for the PC . However , the biggest news is the launch of Nintendo 's amazing new system : the Nintendo 64 , which was lauded for its beautiful graphics and a brilliant new controller.Two games were released along with the system . There was Pilotwings 64 , which was not exactly what was expected , but the other game was called the greatest game of all time ( as of 1996 , that is , at least in the eyes of critics ) by several source . And it really was.The first thing that strikes your eyes is its delicious eye candy . The first thing that pops out at you after the title is Giles Goddard 's Mario face . And boy does it look good ! But enough with the intro . It 's time to see whether the game itself passes the graphics test.Answer ? Yes it does . Even after five years , Super Mario 64 is still one of the most beautiful games for Nintendo 's crowning glory ( speaking from a fanboy 's POV . ) The character and tree designs are very outdated by today 's standards , but the water is still lovely ( though surpassed ) and some of the brick and stone backgrounds still are the most realistic that I have ever seen . Today the graphics would get a C by reviewers , but back in 1996 , this game would get an A+.But who cares how it looks . Let 's see how it sounds.The answer ? Great ! Before 1996 , Nintendo fans never had a chance to hear Mario talk , but the first thing that greets you when you turn on the system is a jingle and the words `` It's-a me , Mario ! '' and `` Hello ! '' while a remixed version of the classic Mario theme plays in the back . But again , this is only the intro . The question is whether games sounds that good.The answer , naturally , would be even better . Mario comes packed with a large batch of sayings including `` Mama mia ! `` , `` Here we go ! '' and `` Press start to play ! '' Unfortunately , everything else ( other than Peach and Bowser ) do n't talk in anything else other than words . But remember the fact that this is a first generation cartridge game , and if people complain for Zelda , then they should n't complain here.The music and sound effects are just divine . Outside the castle , you are greeted with the happy chirping of birds and the roaring of a nearby waterfall . Enter and the cozy castle theme starts playing . Each of the levels come equipped with music that ranges from peaceful to energetic to somber . The Bowser fight music ranges from rock to organ music , and it 's all wonderful.Now that the graphics and the sound are out of the way , let 's get into the meat of the game : the gameplay.The first thing most people would notice is how different this is from traditional Mario games . There are only 1-Up mushrooms , and the only pipe that appears is in the very beginning . However , Super Mario 64 is 3D , and most of those elements just would n't work in a 3D game.The story , according to the manual , is that Peach invites Mario over to the castle for a cake . When Mario reaches the castle , he is greeted with a gruff voice . Wondering what went on , Mario explores the rooms and finds a giant painting where he can jump in . There , he finds himself in a new world , with a giant Bob-Omb on the top . He fights and defeats it ( you 'll have to do that part yourself ) and gets a star . Later , he learns that Bowser has attacked the castle , captured the Princess , stolen the Power Stars , and has sent his army to take over the worlds inside the paintings , then the world itself.Yeah , so it is n't much different from other Mario games , but that 's not the point . The point is , there are 120 stars out there ( although 70 is need to beat the game , but where 's the fun in that ? ) for you to collect . Your misson to explore 15 worlds to find those 120 stars.Well , instead of having a Super Mario and a Mario like in past Mario games , Mario has 8 life bars . Hitting certain enemies would make him lose 2 life bars , as well falling from semi-high heights . Burning Mario 's butt will make him lose 3 . Certain other enemies and falling from really high heights will make him lose 4 . But do n't worry . Coins and water will replenish your health . If you lose all 8 or fall down a pit , you lose a life . But for every 50 coins you get with a star and every 1-Up Mushrooms , you get a life.Your moves include the standard running , punching , butt-stomping , as well as the kick , the long-jump , the wall-kick , the side-somersault , and the backflip . You can also swim ! There are three special caps that gives you special abilities . The Flying Cap gives you the ability to fly . The Metal Cap gives you the ability to walk underwater and be immune to enemy . The Vanish Cap gives you the ability to walk through enemies and certain walls . Mario most employ all of those ablities to save the Princess and the world.The Nintendo 64 controller , with its analog stick , makes it possible for Mario to perform the tasks successfully . ( Just imagine travelling in a 3D world with a D-pad . ) Some people complain about the camera angles and how you have to control them with the C-button . It may be annoying at first , but eventually you 'll get used to it , and it 'll come naturally , and you 'll learn to play with the bad angles.Super Mario 64 not only has good graphics , good sound , and good gameplay , but the fact that it is revolutionary ( in that it brings gaming into the 3D world ) makes it not only the best game of 1996 , but possibly also the best game ever . That 's right , even better than Castlevania and Super Metroid .	1
Super Mario 64 is a great game and is what I would call the best platforming game of all time.PROS+ Memorable music and imaginative courses.+ Game play is always straightforward and never confusing.+ 120 stars to collect for long playing time.+ Graphics were great back when it was made , and is not painful to look at now.CONS- While this game does have replay value , you are n't compelled to play again after you beat it . Give it a while and you will definitely want to play again.This game was not too hard for me , and I beat it when I was in the single-digits as a child . That given , it should n't be too hard for any age . Buy this game now if you have n't ever played it , since it is one of those video games you have to beat .	1
I only bought a N64 recently , but played it numerous times at friends houses . I 've already got a PS2 with 38 games , and 6 for the N64 , and have played god knows how many others but I have to say that Super Mario 64 is on my top 5 list !	1
This game was the premiere launch game for the Nintendo 64 when it premiered and despite the fact that it is only a single played game , pulls off fun gameplay and great graphics . Despite the fact of newer systems like Xbox , PS2 , and even Nintendo 's own Gamecube , I would still be happy to have this game sitting on my shelf next to games like Red Faction and Halo . This game prved itself showing off the power that the Nintendo 64 had and showed it off to the loyal people who bought one instead of a PS-X and even those who ( like me ) bought both a Nintendo 64 and a PS-X . But , not to mince words I 'll explain the game . You are Mario one of the most well known characters in video game history . You play through this adventure all in 3D . This was one of the true selling factors of this game as it was Mario 's first true step into the Third Dimension ( Hushed Gasp ) . But , the game sold great and over time has proved in it 's own right that it is a classic .	1
Super Mario 64 is a game I 've wanted to play for ages . I finally decided to purchase it and I was not disappointed . In my opinion Super Mario 64 is the best in the Mario series and one of the best games ever . This game was a breakthrough in 3Dplatformers and it 's easy to see why . The 3D is great for its time and the style is incredible.The game is addictive as well . I would play for hours and hours and would n't want to stop , and Super Mario 64 does not get tiresome after you beat it for the first time.The plot is simple , Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach and Mario must save her . But the plot 's not important in a video game . The game play is what matters.The game is fast paced and you always have new areas to unlock . Despite not having any other areas to go to outside of Princess Peach 's castle there are tons of areas inside . Getting to new areas is simple . You need a certain amount of stars to unlock doors , and unlock enough doors to unlock boss doors . Overall , there are 120 stars in the entire game and I would recommend a guide because of how challenging it is.When battling Bowser in this game , I was disappointed . He 's so easy . When I beat him the first time I was surprised how easy he was . It was more difficult getting to Bowser than it was battling him . But all three incredible boss stages that were before the battles are so much fun it makes up for it.There are also hidden items , characters and power ups for Mario to find.Now there are a few problems like any other game that I think are quite frustrating . Mario 's controls sometimes are a little tough . His wall jumps have to be so precise and if you mess up you have to do it again and again , and the camera sometimes can be tough to use in certain areas . But , despite these problems it 's still a great game.This game is a must own for Mario fans . While yet you must already know this since I 'm writing this review thirteen years later . : ) Super Mario 64 will always be known as one of the best 3Dplatformers in video game history .	1
I grew up playing Super Mario 64 . If you are considering buying this game , do n't hestitate or think twice . This game is really fun . It can keep you entertained for hours . The graphics are simply stunning even by today 's standards , considering the age of this game . It is a CLASSIC , MUST HAVE for any N64 players , Mario fans or video game fanatics .	1
Super Mario 64 was the first game to be available for the N64 . I remember the first time it came out , how it 's graphics , music and gameplay really amazed me . Sadly , very few games came after it to give much competition . To this day , it still remains one of the best N64 games out there . The sheer scope of the game is enough to pick it up . It 's made up of 20+ levels that can be played in a semi-non linear order . The graphics are bright and clear , and the animations are creative for each character . Gameplay is pretty deep , but extremely intuitive and becomes second nature after playing for a short time . The real plus in this game is the music , some of the most catchiest to be written for a game to date . Pick this one up for both its historical value and for the fact that its a great game .	1
This game is coooooollll ! Me Abigail has this game and I have 120 stars . They were soo easy to find . I do not know how I became an expert at this . For your information , I am an expert in all of my video games . I must feel like the luckiest girl in the world . But I 'll give you a little info : Title : Rainbow ride/ Star # 2You 'll have to take another magic carpet ride through low-flying areial obstacles to reach the cloud house . The blue blocks that float in your way are bigger on this carpet ride and you 'll have to jump on them quickly before the carpet moves out from under your feet . The Magic Carpet will take you through the cloud house twice . On both trips , whatch out for the jet of fire that comes out from the fireplace ! I'ts best to stay to the rear of the carpet until the fire is out , then go to theleading ledge of the carpet . If you get knocked off the carpet , it 's a log trip back to a spot where you can remount it . ( there 's a warp to the top of the maze on the Cloud House Balcony . )	1
Still the best 3D game on the market . Challenging , tons of fun levels and amazing gameplay . A true model for 3D games .	1
When I first played Super Mario 64 as a kid , I was amazed . I never even had the game though . Heck , I never had a Nintendo 64 . This game like many other Nintendo 64 titles encouraged me to go out and buy myself a Nintendo 64 16 years after its release . I used to play this game with friends and cousins . Playing it now brings back such great memories . This game is what a game is all about . An unforgettable story , an interesting environment , and overall FUN . This game does n't get old . In my opinion , it beats out most modern games today . Super Mario 64 formed the basis for all 3-Dimensional video games . If you were considering getting this game , do n't consider any longer . GET IT .	1
I do n't know how many times I 've played this game from start to finish.Like a lot of people my decision to buy a N64 was based on the Mario 64 commercials.The WOW factor was in full effect.When I got home and started playing it literally felt like the first time I experienced Atari or the Sega Genesis.Blown away would be an understatement.The game itself ? Perfection even with a few minor things.The good.M64 ushered in a whole new age of platforming.Brought us 3D platfroming that was just about perfect in every way.The graphics for it 's time were second to none.The control was spot on.The story line was simple but cute like all Mario games.Hidden secrets like being able to wall jump up to the roof.I could go on and on ... ... .The bad ? My only gripe is the camera.The camera can get quite wonky in places and funny ... even to this day bad cameral angles still plague 3D games.Nintendo and other companies have for the most part gotten the camera down with the free moving camera feature . Too bad some companies are still completely clueless.To summarize.Perfection.Groundbreaking.A legend that spawned a thousand imitators , some good , most ... not so good.Ca n't beat the original.Highest recommendations .	1
this is an amazing game . one that you can enjoy playing from the start to the finish .	1
For anyone who was a fan of video games , they remember the year of 1996 : The Playstation made waves and drew many Nintendo fans away with its 32-bit graphics and CD based games . For the first time , Nintendo was being challenged on its own ground and they had to answer Sony with a console of its own . After they put the Super Nintendo system to rest , they went to work and released the Nintendo 64 to the public . The odds were against them because with only two launch titles to choose from , early adopters had to either pick Pilotwings 64 ( a good game ) or Super Mario 64 . This game was the reason Nintendo 's console immediately flew off the shelves and showed that Mario can make the jump to 3D and it was fun doing so.I 'll make my review short because other reviewers had covered the basics and importance of Super Mario 64 . It stars Mario in an open world where each stage is contained within various paintings scattered through Princess Peach 's castle . The storyline is pretty typical by now : King Bowser kidnaps the princess and you jump in to rescue her . The graphics are colorful , bright and were a breakthrough in video game technology at the time . The controls are perfect and take almost no time to get used to . It 's a pretty challenging game so expect to replay certain stages over and over again . So why did I give it 4.5 stars ? The camera is not perfect but back then , getting the camera to work in any open world style game was difficult to program . It always centers behind you but sometimes gets a little wacky when you go up ledges or around corners . It gets annoying after awhile but you learn to tolerate it.What made this game groundbreaking was that games of this type proved to be a challenge to make and to make it fun as well is really the main goal . Super Mario 64 exceeds this and was a commercial success with gamers and gained much critical acclaim from reviewers of virtually every gaming publication . Those who say did n't like were in the minority and for reasons that were just too petty and silly . While gaming has changed tremendously since 1996 , this game shows that the platform genre was at one point the kind of games that everyone wanted to play . And now , you can either track down the cartridge or get this for the Nintendo DS . So if you have n't played this , take a look for yourself as to why many gamers loved to play this game . I highly recommend it .	1
This game is excellent ... .this game has state of the art graphics for its time ... .and it still looks perfect now in 2008 ... you must own this .	1
I got this game MANY years ago for the N64 , and I just loved it ! The game presented a large challenge , while at the same time made it very fun ! The music is the best heard in a game , the graphics are superb for an N64 title , and this Mario game is a blast ! I guess the most noticeable feature are the environments that the game provides . Every environment that Mario enters is just awesome ! I especially love the Rainbow level and the Snow level where all of the penguins are . The best feature is the fact that every age group can enjoy the hours of entertainment from the game and they can all enjoy collecting stars from each stage to save Peach and defeat Bowser . Oh , by the way , the Bowser levels are AWESOME ! Fighting Bowser himself is very fun as well ! The game is also good in the fact that it provides unsatirical yet not stupid humor as well . This is great for younger gamers . I guess the worst part of Super Mario 64 is the lack of replayability . It 's like Vice City where it will take months to play and finish the game , but once it 's done , you wo n't want to play it again without getting bored . Once the ride 's over , you 'll feel like you ca n't go play it each day , and the game is kind of wasted in that aspect . Overall , if you are a fan of Mario or Nintendo , then this game may just be suited for your needs ! My rating-9.2 !	1
I 'm not very good at video games , so this game is pretty tough for me . I only have about 20 stars right now and I 've had it about a year ! However , other than the not-so-great 3D graphics and the silly camera angles , it is a fun though challanging game . I look forward to someday getting all 120 starts ! ! ! haha	1
What can I say ? This game is fun and funny at the same time . From mario flying around with the magic caps to Mario burning his [ ... ] cheeks on the hot lava , this game is great ! My only problem with this game is the freakin camera angles ! ! ! AHHHHH sometimes I feel like I could just kick the Lakitu that controls the thing ! Angles sometimes get soooo akward that it makes it difficult to make a jump correctly..or so you wo n't go flying down to your death . Other than that I give it a 4 . Would be 5 if the camera was better .	1
This game was a very fun game . You basicly go to a castle and you jump into a paintings.. each one leading you into a different world ... and in every world ... you have to find 7 stars ... ( one of em is the 100 coin star where you need to collect 100 coins then it pops up it 's the hardest star to get ) there 's 16 worlds in all ... most worlds take hours to complete so this game well be well worth it.. This game right here is history ... It 's one of Nintendo 's biggest hits ... and when you buy this game you 'll soon find out why : )	1
The best game for the nintendo 64 IS THIS ! Yhis game rocks really it does its one of the best n64 game i have ever played 10/10	1
I bought this game in 1997 , over a year after it was released . The first few weeks i played it , i was amazed at the beautiful 3D graphics . Honestly , i had never seen 3D graphics before this game , so it was awesome and inspiring.I love this game , so i 'm writing this review . There are some memorable moments from this game ( like when Mario ventures into the haunted mansion or when he goes on a rainbow ride in the skies ) All in all , it showcases the N64 incredible 3D graphics and the sound is n't half bad.The levels are interesting and sparse ( i beat this game with the Nintendo Power guidebook ) and should take some time to crack the puzzles . Basically , the game is quite easy and not surprisingly , it has enough mini-quests and puzzles to keep you occupied . As for level designs , i think it 's excusable considering it 's first generation stuff but still deep enough to immerse you ( again ) after a long absence ... My gripe is while this game is really good ( i mean i 'm a big-time Mario fan from the first mario game ) , it 's only as good as it lasts . I found it hard to go back to this game after a while- cause it was like having discovered everything and it made it hard to play through the whole thing again.My advice : play selectively . You need to get into the mood . While i say that , it 's without doubt that i have never regretted buying this game.Even if i never play this game again and leave it to collect dust ( not likely ) -i 'll always remember this game as one of the finest moments of the N64 lifetime ( that is 1996-2001 ) .Anyway , every Super Mario game is groundbreaking ( SMB1 created the side-scroller , SMB2 was queer and fun , SMB3 is the greatest platform game ever , SMB4 was one of the most replayed game i ever played and this game is mario in 3D without luigi , which is sad ) But cheer up people- the next generation is almost upon us . But i know that when we look at 3D graphics today , we will know that this game had a part to play in making this our reality today .	1
i thought i already rated this but i just love amazon dont you ? even the reviews are hilarious that i found on youtube and go on smosh on twitter .	1
Good game for it 's time period , kinda miss the old 64 graphics . The cartridge came before it 's due date , and it works wonderfully . Thanks .	1
When I first saw Super Mario 64 in 1996 I had to pick my jaw up off the ground . While 10 years have passed , I still consider this game of the finest pieces of entertainment I have ever seen . The kinds of things that the development team pulled off in the mid 90s set the stage for all future video game development and it was , is and always will be groundbreaking.An achievement that should not be ignored and is still as much fun today as it was a decade ( DECADE ? ! ! ? ) ago . ***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION	1
i remember when i was in high school and this game was brand new and just came out . I played this sooooo much , i got an ache in my hand . I 've only beaten it once , but i 'll tell you what , in that one time , it took me 3 to 4 months to beat it .	1
I could knock a few stars off by going on and on about what they SHOULD have put into this game -a playable Princess , animal costumes , Fire Flowers , etc.- but such negativity could foolishly ruin such a great game . Super Mario 64 is n't perfect but it has the best damn gameplay of any action title . The worlds are massive with lots of vibrant colors , whacky enemies , catchy music , and most importantly , gameplay.The only downsides to this game are Mario 's horribly annoying voice , an occasionally fussy camera , and the possibility of graining your N64 control stick when you fight Bowser . These minor neusances are mild though and they do n't really hinder the gameplay . All other downsides merely point to the characters themselves : Mario speaks with a bad Italian accent voiced by Charles Martinet instead of his old Brooklyn one from the cartoon series . I also do n't like the changes made to Princess Toadstool . Instead of the spunky redhead from the cartoon series , she seems more like a `` dumb blonde '' with a weird voice.Yes , this game is old but , like fine wine , games can get better with age .	1
The 3D age began when Mario was in 3D . A gem for N64 ! Graphics : 10/10 For a 1996 game , these look great ! It 's clear and unfuzzy.Sound/music 9/10 Nice music and Mario talks ! Gameplay : 10/10 Mario has to go through 15 vast , challanging worlds . Packed with a huge arsnel of moves , he searches for Power Stars in a `` mission '' there are also hidden stars in the castles ! If you get all 120 , you get a reward ! Also , Mario has three cap Powerups : Invisibility , Metal , and Winged . You have to find them though.Believe it or not , I think this is one of the finest entries of the series . A must own ! It 's also being rereleased for the DS !	1
It was incredible to see this game when it came out in 1996 , my brother and I had our minds blown . We lived in this game , and Mario Kart and thought entertainment would never be the same . Years ago , this was the one word on Videogames , it revolutionized everything and no one has duplicated it . A must-own and play . It 's ... just incredible .	1
This game was one of my favorite games on the N64 ... one of 10 or 12 ... anyway , this game is stunning graphicly ( for it 's time ) and the gameplay is a blast and challengingyou can find this game on any emulator site ... check it out	1
One of the best mario games ever made , it was such a huge jump from the previous consoles looked and played amazingly , hours of entertainment for anyone that enjoys adventure type games .	1
Super Mario 64 , is a Classic pure and simple . And , there 's not much else I can say . It 's a really good game , With alot of stuff that 's fun to come back and do . You , can fly around with your Wing cap , Or Slide down a huge sliding board of Ice ! Mario 64 is Pure classic , Pure fun .	1
mario was always kind if a hard game for me . i unlocked a lot of stars but a lot of the game went unlocked . i never did beat the whole thing . there are some cheats you can look up online for this game .	1
This is a top classic Mario game . I would highly recommend getting it if you love the Mario series ! Very good game !	1
I stand behind this game being the best Super Mario game nintendo has produced . Too bad it was on a system that people did n't enjoy - too many complaints over the control and the game selection and graphics capability it was a true underdog . But Super mario 64 has so many good qualitiesthis game takes forever to beat . Some may think this is a nusance but its filled with many many wonderful levels of funeach level is unique and its organized in a wonderful fashion , you never get too confused in nagivating the gameThere is ALWAYS something new to find , and many races and somewhat minigames that are actually entertaining and not ultimately annoy you.You get frusterated when you lose , you realize this is n't some easy game you can breeze through , its actually difficult - appreciate that challenge because challenge is hard to come by in games these days.Graphics are n't overdone . Good , you can find flaws , especially these days , the angles may alert some gamers as being old fashioned , but think about it like this ... its not 2D . lol.Overall , I love this game . Without a doubt , I consider it amongst the top 3 of my favorite games . If you have n't played this game , you are really missing out on something , go play it , you 'll see how fun and exciting this game can be . and believe me - it only gets better .	1
Super Mario 64 has some of the best graphics ever shown on a home console.Believe it or not but I like the graphics in Super Mario 64 more than the graphics in Super Mario Sunshine.Sure the levels look great and have snappy tunes to match but the game is way too easy except for Bowser.Mario 64 is overrated but still one of the best games ever made.It isnt the best game of all time but it packs a powerful punch.Lets hope Super Mario 128 is even better with harder challenges , better graphics and more levels . I mean Mario 64 was great but the sequel should be harder because I dont really want to own 2 Mario games that are too easy and not long enough .	1
the original party game . the nostalgia that this game brings back makes it a must buy ! one of the best games of all times	1
So what is Mario 's quest this time ? Save the Princess `` Peach '' by defeating the evil Bowser , while collecting 70 stars in only 15 levels ( all 15 levels are contained in 1 huge castle ) . It might not be the best Mario game , but it offers a new 3D world and a whole new realism . It also has new features such as an energy feature , where rather than collecting power-ups like the fire flower , you now collect a gold coin and you get a block of energy back ! Now Mario has far more of an offense rather than just stomping enemies , he can now throw punches , kicks and slide into enemies , making full use of the 3D plane . The enemies come to life in 3D , such as huge chain chomps , menacing goombas and annoying koopas The graphics could have been better , because they make enemies out of simple colors rather than textures like more recent games have . The music and sound effects are nice , because Mario now has a voice to be heard . There are however only minimal power-ups , such as Mario 's Winged hat , which allows him to fly , and Mario 's steel cap , making him invincible .	1
i dont think i really need to tell you why this game is amazing if you have played it you already know	1
In these decades of the digital world with superior hardware and high definition graphics , I do n't believe gamers will ever encounter the same life changing experience as those who have first hand seen Mario evolve into a 3D masterpiece . The Nintendo 64 is the best console of its time HANDS DOWN ! ! and Super Mario 64 is a MASTERPIECE .	1
Probably the most epic of the first generation of 3D platformers , and certainly one of the most well-known . With 120 stars to collect , you can spend quite a bit of time working up the perfect game . Just do n't go for that & # 34 ; unlocking Luigi & # 34 ; nonsense . It was all an urban legend .	1
this is wat made me love mario . mario 64 ! this is the biggest game crammed into a cartridge ive seen , its musically awesome , graphically it shows age , and the camera isnt as good as it could be , but I still havent beaten it since then ! thats how massive & how much gameplay there is to it ! I remember sliding down caves & smashing boulders back in the day , now that a friend sold it to me , Im in love with it !	1
Here 's a cool trick ! ( you have to have the 2nd key you get from Bowser ) Topic : Snowman has your hatSent in from : AnubisGet your blown off by the big snowman . Do n't pick your hat up at all . Instead go get a star ( It dos n't have to be a new star ) and save and turn off N64 . Wait 10 seconds ... ..now turn N64 back on.Go back to that level and one of the little snowmen that pops out of the snow will have Mario 's hat on their head .	1
Where are all the green pipes ! ! ! Why is there no coin counter for running around the Castle ! There are coins all over the place ! I want to collect a 100 coin castle star ! Did you even think before you sent this to production BRO ! Is this even this games final form ? ! ? THE CAKE WAS A LIE ! ! !	1
I have been playing video games for years . My first console was the original Nintendo and then the Super Nintendo followed by the Nintendo 64 . Super Mario 64 came out when I was about 10 years old and it was an instant hit . Super Mario 64 was the greatest Super Mario game of them all . My nephew has a Nintendo 64 and he wants some new games for his birthday . I thought what 's better than Super Mario 64 . I bought this for his birthday and he will love it . I would recommend Super Mario 64 to anyone who wants to play a fun and family oriented Mario game .	1
I Love this game it 's the best Mario game on Nintendo 64 . It is fun and everyone would love playing this game .	1
This is one of the best games ever made for the N64 console.It will always be a reminder of my younger years and my kids love it .	1
One of the launch titles for the N64 back in '96 Super Mario 64 had only a small band of rivals at the time . The most prominent being Star Wars Shadows of the Empire and Star Fox 64 . The game has stood the test of time in several factors . One you can still find it brand new . Two the previous games mentioned are almost impossible to find unused ! Three for a launch game the graphics were great , but they are not as good as late comer Banjo-Kazooie . The story line is interesting and the levels are big , but not as large as Banjo-Kazooie . You have to find 100 Power Stars that Bowser stole from Princess Peaches 's castle , and if you get all 100 you can go to a cannon near the castle , hop inside , shoot onto the roof of the castle , meet Yoshi ( Mario 's dinosaur friend ) who will give a super new jump and 100 lives ! The games levels are challenging espicially the last few levels and the levels where you fave Bowser ( you have to beat him three times ) are DANGEROUS especially the last one . From the sea to land to desert to snow covered mountain and to the desert and beyond Mario must battle enemies in 3-d and collect six stars on every level . Five stars are attainable by completing tasks while the sixth is attainable when you collect 100 coins on a level . The music is hummable and the characters are nice and mean . This is still Marios biggest adventure and with the coming of the Gamecube and the fall in price for the Nintendo 64 and its games , Super Mario 64 is a must have . I 've had my 64 since Christmas '97 and also received Super Mario 64 which is still a GREAT game !	1
This is a change of pace for Mario . Its 3D and you have to do tons of missions for each level.While this adds depth do the game it can also make you really frustrated ( especially because the N64 controllers are so awkward ) when you go to a mission and its really difficult to complete it . My advice is that you should take a break from that level and play an easy , fun one.I wish this game didnt have so many jumping styles though . Mario Sunshine is a thing for us to look forward to but will at be an action/adventure game like this one ? Is Bowser even in it ? We do n't know yet . The one thing we do know is that the Game Cube controller is easier to use than the N64 one and that the new Mario game 's guide will be easy to look for . While I still say Super Mario Bros 3 is the most fun Mario game of all time , this one comes close . I prefer Sonic Adventure though . Im not even all that good at most video games ( including Mario 64 ) but even I can tell that Mario 64 is a classic just because the levels Ive completed were so fun and still are .	1
This is so classic and we love it ! Do n't forget to buy a rumble pack so you can feel when you crash or go over the railroad tracks !	1
This game is really good . It was the launch title for the Nintendo 64 . It 's a full 3D world . The objective of the game is to collect the Power Stars in Princess Peach 's Castle to get to the top of the castle to fight Bowser and save the princess . 70 stars out of the 120 are required to face Bowser . This game is really big too ; you can fly , turn invisible and go through certain types of walls , and turn into metal ! The game is really good and I would recommend this to anyone who has a N64 . If you do n't have a N64 , you can get it from the Virtual Console service on Wii for about 10 bucks .	1
One of my all time favorite games for the Nintendo 64 ! I missed playing this and finally ordered the game just to feel the nostalgia , ha . The game works perfectly , and I feel like a little kid again fighting bowser : D	1
This game is great and fun to play . They are many powers that you can get like flying and so on . The color of the background is alright . The color look 's smooth and rich and bright.There are lot of bosses that you have to beat and alot of stars to find . In order to fine them look very , very , hard you never know a star could be under your nose.The level 's are cooler and better than the other old mario games that I playden in a long time.The level 's can be very very hot or very cold places or the level 's can have water so you have to swim . Or some of the level 's can be nice or normal.In the game Mario can do some cool moves like back flip and so on . In the level 's you do n't get one star there are many star 's in one level . Each level has many star 's to fine . Get the star 's and be very very powerful .	1
MY NEPHEW IS HAVING A BLAST PLAYING MARIO AGAIN . THANK YOU HE PLAYS IT ALL THE TIME AFTER SCHOOL , ITS HARD FOR ME TO TAKE HIM AWAY FROM THE GAME	1
Super Mario 64 is one of the most amazing games I 've ever played . In fact , it 's my second favorite game of all time , next to Super Mario Galaxy . You get to explore the large levels freely , and do most of the levels in any order you want . Gameplay and controls are simple and easy to pick up , but they 're very fun . Not only do the good graphics look 3D , but the music also sounds 3D . Some things in this game are just too great for words , it 's easily the game of the decade for the 90 's , easily beating out Super Mario World ( The second best ) , which is amazing . This game is far supirior to that overrated Zelda Ocarina of Time . I rate this game 100/100 . It 's Perfect !	1
This great game is commonly overshadowed by the INFERIOR N64 Zelda games . If you have the N64 without this game , what are you waiting for ? Buy this game ! Super Mario 64 has GREAT gameplay , sound effects , music , graphics , and an excellent intro to top it all off !	1
Super Mario 64 one of the greatest games for N64.Story/Plot : the Story begins with a letter from Princess Peach inviting Mario to come to her castle for a cake she has baked for him . However , when he arrives , Mario discovers that Bowser has invaded the castle and imprisoned the princess and her servants within it using the power of the castle 's 120 Power Stars . Many of the castle 's paintings are portals to other worlds , in which Bowser 's minions keep watch over the stars . Mario explores the castle for these portals to enter the worlds and recover the stars . He gains access to more rooms as he recovers more Power Stars , and eventually traverses three different obstacle courses , each leading to its own battle with Bowser . Defeating Bowser the first two times earns Mario a key for opening another level of the castle . After Mario defeats Bowser in the final battle , Peach is released from the stained-glass window above the castle 's entrance . Peach rewards Mario by kissing him on the nose and baking the cake that she had promised him.Gameplay : Each course is an enclosed world in which the player is free to wander in all directions and discover the environment without time limits . The worlds are filled with enemies that attack Mario as well as friendly creatures that provide assistance , offer information , or ask a favor ( such as pink `` peace-loving '' Bob-omb Buddies ) . The player gathers stars in each course ; some stars only appear after completing certain tasks , often hinted at by the name of the course . These challenges include defeating a boss , solving puzzles , racing an opponent , and gathering coins . As more stars are collected , more areas of the castle hub world become accessible . The player unlocks doors in the castle with keys obtained by defeating Bowser in special courses . There are many hidden mini-courses and other secrets to the game , most containing extra stars needed to complete the game entirely . Some courses contain cannons that Mario can access by speaking to a pink Bob-omb Buddy . After entering a cannon , Mario can be shot out to reach distant places . When the player has the Wing Cap equipped , cannons can be used to reach high altitudes or fly across most levels quickly.The gameplay and control is fricken awesome u can control mario in more ways then 1.Power ups : Some courses have special cap power-ups which augment Mario 's abilities . The Wing Cap allows Mario to fly ; the Metal Cap makes him immune to most damage , allows him to withstand wind , walk underwater , and be unaffected by noxious gases ; and the Vanish Cap renders him partially immaterial and allows him to walk through some obstacles such as wire mesh , as well as granting invulnerability to some forms of damage.Abilities : Mario can wall jump , long jump , and many more.Music : the Music is all original nothing has been copied but the game music is awesome for each stage . In short Super Mario 64 is a great game and it deserves respect.This game is a must get in your video game collection . This game also started the trend where super games have 64 in their name for example Donkey Kong 64 Super Mario Kart 64 Pilotwings 64 and Super Man 64.Story 5/5 Gameplay 5/5 Music 5/5 Powerups 5/5 Overall 10/10 = A+	1
The kids play this game at least once a week since they 've had it so yes its worth the money	1
Surprisingly , when Nintendo created the N64 game system , they had absolutely no idea of how succesful it would be . The first game that the system ran on was also a scream . It just sometimes comes to me as a surprise that a lot of these newer games that run on CD-ROM like the Playstation 2 , and the XBOX may have faster and better graphics , but not likely with the actual loading time.Nintendo 's Super Mario 64 , remains as the most dynamic staple of any N64 system to date . The graphics are just completely amazing , and so strong from one angle to another . In Super MArio 64 , you guide Mario through 15 terrific stages with exciting adventure around every corner . The object of the game is to try collect as many stars as possible that are hidden in the game . Each star is very vital inorder to help you save Peach , whom is still known as Princess Toadstool , from the vile Bowser . Each course takes you from all depths of the secret kingdom , from Sea , to the firey sky , and even in a spooky ghost-filled house . The load up time for this , and every other N64 game is much faster than the CD-Rom games for the PC , and the other CD-Rom console games.It is kind of sad Nintendo stopped making fantastic games on cartridge like this , and traded it for a CD-ROM gaming factory , with the Gamecube . Nevertheless , Super Mario 64 is still the most superior game of the 20th century , and that is not even a pizza-faced lie .	1
This is everything I thought It would be . It was the first game I got when I got my n64 and it was great	1
I enjoyed this game . It was very fun . It was the very first game I owned for the N64 , so I did n't really understand how the controls worked but this game was really easy to figure out . I love it . When I walk by it in stores and see it ... , I 'm speechless . It is a great game , and by the looks of it , the price it down too . This is definently worth your money .	1
I played this game when it first came out at a friends house but i never bought it . I was not that in to the 64 back then . But now i think it is very fun and entertaning . The graphics r good for the 64 , including that it was the first game ever for it . That is why almost everyone who has a 64 has this game . If u take the snes newest games graphics compared to this game , which is only a couple years apart , these graphics seem life like . It has a great adventure but its weird that Luigi is not in this game . It adds much more new items , charecters , and levels . I like that it is first person view unstead of the side view like on the past marios . Ever since this game most marios have been first person view . This is why i want sm64 ds , it is like the 64s but different graphics and differnent layouts . I will get the ds one in the future but thats a different story . Like i said , my top favorite game today .	1
Okay so when I decided I wanted to buy a `` new '' nintendo 64 , my brain automatically said `` now where can I find super mario '' . Hours upon hours were spent on this game when I was a tweenager and I had so much fun with it . So I went out as soon as I could and bought it again.I was kind of worried , because I had gotten some games with my system that I used to this were fun also but they ended up being a little too easy since I 'm older now , but when I got this and played it it was exactly the same . Some easy levels , and some that take forever to get through , but in a good way.I have had it for a month now and have n't gotten bored with it yet . So I recommend this game to people of all ages . I even let my 3 year old brother try it out and he had a blast , even though he had no clue how to really navigate 100 % .BUY IT .	1
it 's a great game but you can get the same thing on your ds for a lot cheaper so if you like portable devices get it on your ds	1
Well I do n't acttully have 120 stars , but that is how much you are suposse to get . But I have 95 stars ! I am onyy 9 so please awnser my revies for me !	1
Okay , the game is very addicting . The sound , graphics , gameplay is all great ! But I discoverd something else funer . Super Mario 64 DS . That game is way better . This game is good but that game is something you ca n't keep your eyes off . Remember when you finish the game and eyerything to do and ther'es nothing left to do , well this DS game has mini games . They are very addicting and fun ! You can draw on this as well . The adventure mode takes longer folks . You can play as Yoshi , Luigi , Mario Wario . In The beginning of Super Mario 64 , you could just walk in . But thwe DS version is different . You have to collect a rabbit to get in . There is more room 's in this castle too with more levels . Instead of collecting 120 stars . You have to collect 150 . If you do n't have enogh money for a DS and the game but have a N64 , dust off the original and have some fun . Or go out and buy your DS and game . Get whatever . You have to play this though . If you do n't think I 'm right , then you will be sorry .	1
I think Mario is a great game . Fighting Bowser is the funnest part in this game . The best part is when you see Yoshi . Yoshi gives you 100 lives . It 's fun looking for Mario 's cap when Mario loses his cap . The game is one of the first 3D and is very good game for N64 . Even thoughGameCube has the best graphics , the game is very graphical game.The game may have many challenges , even after you get 120 stars . This Mario game is very fun for N64 and I have to say this is one of the greatest hits I 've ever had for N64 .	1
Hello again , friends . What bad can be said about Mario 64 ? The polygons are smooth as silk , very , very , VERY rare slowdown , and the Mario we know and love.Can anyone guess what plumber 's job is in this game ? It 's to traverse 15 levels in search of Princess Peach . On the way , you have to stomp on Bowser 's head . Thrice . All your favorite enemies are back , with the exception of Koopa Troopas . The goombas , shy guy , the Lakita Brothers , the moles , Bob-ombs , everyone 's back ! At a graphics standpoint , Super Mario 64 is absolutely outstanding in every way , shape , and form . Kudos to Nintendo . 5 out of 5 for graphics.A great soundtrack and a great Mario voice make for a great overall sound . 5 out of 5 for sound.The huge worlds will keep you coming back for more . There is no way to put this thing down . 5 out of 5 for replay.The final score ? Go look at the stars.See ya later . Go buy this game . Merry Christmas . Luv ya .	1
I did n't use to be into Mario or Kirby but now I like them both as much as I like the Legend of Zelda series I still have many more games to purchase based on those 2 characters . But I think SuperMario 64 is a great story game a killer for the old games meant for the gameboy . So enjoy !	1
Greetings , I am Oklonia . My review of Super Mario 64 is right here.Super Mario 64 is a game that all master N64 gamers have to own ! I do n't even need to tell the story . What 's happened ? The same traditional story : Bowser kidnaps Princess Toadstool , Mario finds the princess , rescues her , and destroys Bowser.Capcise.The courses and star 's names are quite creative . ( e.g . Lil ' Penguin Lost ) They are more riddles though.The graphics are so sharp looking and realistic , that maybe just a few could go on GameCube . ( GCN ) Despite a few annoying sounds and no multiplayer mode , Super Mario 64 is really super ! This has been Oklonia .	1
& quot ; Super Mario & quot ; is arguably the most successful and most recognizable brand name in the history . It seems that every time Nintendo releases a new episode in the series , it hits video gaming gold . From the earliest release of the original & quot ; Super Mario Brothers & quot ; on the original Nintendo Entertainment System , it has always been a hit . Even lesser known titles in the series , like & quot ; Super Mario World 2 : Yoshi 's Island & quot ; , stay faithful to the series and produce very entertaining gameplay . With the dawn of Nintendo 's three dimensional , 360 degree rotating platform , Nintendo 64 , the question became , & quot ; Could Nintendo maximize the potential of this new platform and give Mario a fresh angle ? & quot ; The answer , in the form of & quot ; Super Mario 64 & quot ; , proved to be a quite emphatic & quot ; YES ! & quot ; & quot ; Super Mario 64 & quot ; takes the technique of 'multiple goals ' for each level ( introduced in & quot ; Super Mario World & quot ; ) and expands it in a quite impressive manner . There are 15 worlds Mario must navigate in an effort to free the Princess who is trapped in paintings in her castle . The goal is to accumulate at least 70 stars to unlock the passage way the final battle with Bowser . As each world contains 7 stars of its own in addition to 15 bonus stars around the castle , it would seem to be a walk in the park . However , all is not as it seems . Several of the doors leading the different worlds are sealed off either by locks or star requirements . Therefore , there is a limited amount of ways to accumulate the necessary stars until more stars are attained or earlier battles with Bowser are won . Of course , this leads to a journey through amazing worlds were Mario travels the depths of the ocean , soars in the open sky , battles over scorching lava , and even gets to sneak through a haunted house . The variety of worlds and objectives are truly amazing , as are the new moves Mario can make to help accomplish these goals . No longer content to just move forward and jump , Mario can now do backflips , long jumps , wall leaps , and crawls.One other aspect of & quot ; Super Mario 64 & quot ; that makes it standout is its use of rotating camera angles to track Mario 's movements through each world . It takes some getting used to , but it enables a truly three dimensional feel . This is game that Nintendo built its release of Nintendo 64 around . It delivered magnificently then and , with its continual replay value , still delivers today .	1
Super Mario 64 was and still is one of the best and most revolutionary video game ever made . The game was a launch title for the Nintendo 64 and boy did the game make its mark on the console . Sure we have games like Banjoe Kazooi , Ocarina of Time but this game was the first to come out and is still an instant class and started many many famous game rippoffs ( Like many people say Banjoe Kazooi was a ripoff but I DID N'T SAY THAT so do n't flame me ! ) but that 's beyond the point , this game is still one of the most beloved video game ever . When Super Mario 64 launched with the N64 it was indeed a very revolutionary game , it was the first game to present 3d platforming , state of the art graphics and some of funnest/best gameplay you 'll see in platforming/action games . The game is HUGE ! In Mario 64 you WILL be going through many , many stages to collect stars so you can unlock more areas for more stars and ultimatley put the evil bowser to an end and once again save Princes Peach . I was one of many people who first played this game back when it launched with the Nintendo 64 and when you compare it to todays games the game ( to many , but not me ) looks terrible but you got ta understand , the time this game was released ( 96 ' ) it was INFACT the best looking video game ever ... ..period ... and even today when I play this classic , it still looks amazing ! Call me crazy but I seriously still think this is one of the best looking video games of not only the mid 90 's but even today , it is still marvalous ! The music in Mario 64 was just plain perfect , the music blended in with the games levels and star hunting , words can not explain how well Miyamoto and Nintendo did for the music , it 's just plain good ! The controls are also tight and well focused , I especially love the array of moves Mario has and although the controls may feel abit clumsy at times it never bothered me once ! As for camera , yes there were times were I wanted to break the tv but the reward and satisfaction of getting a star after that trouble feels so good ! Audio , controls , graphics are all A+ and as for gameplay ? ... Well it depends..Do you like platforming/action/exploring/collecting games because you will be collecting pretty much for the whole game ( Stars , duuhhh ) and if the answer is yes then this may be the best game you 've ever played ! Now for me the gameplay was truly fun and innovative , I never got bored once in this game . It 's so fun , hunting for stars never gets annoying or frustraiting ! Speaking of difficulty the game is perfect , it 's not hard nor is it easy like pie ( acctually I take that back , for many people this game will be easy if you wan na just beat the plot ) but it just gets it right on difficulty , I do n't remember ever being frusraited or angry with the game ( then again I never did try to get all 120 stars ) and just having a great time with the game ... it seriously is one of the funnest experiences I 've ever had with a game and as I said before ... .this game is revolutionary ! Now that I 'm done ranting and talking about this game I 'll just get to it quickly ... The Good-One of the best and most revolutionary game ever..period-Back then and even today it is still one of the best looking video games ever made-Loads of things to do-Not hard , but not too easy , it 's juuuust about right-The game is just plain fun , the moves , the platforming , collecting , ect-Collecting stars is really fun ! -The music in this game is just plain fun to listen to ! ! -Though the bosses are easy I still think they 're just classics ! -Will take a very long time to get all 120 stars , and collecting 120 stars means spending lots of time with this amazing title-The worlds and places you visit are all so different and an amazment to look atThe Bad-Some may feel that game is feeling abit dated now ( the game is pretty old now ! ! ) -Some will find the graphics to be `` terrible '' or just `` bad '' which I find hard to believe-People who just want to beat the games plot and nothing els should n't even touch the game ( because the game does n't take too long to beat for plot and if you 're planning on not having a fun time with the game and just wanting to beat the game and getting it over with , what 's the point of that ? ) -Some will be angry with the camera-Alot of people today or in the future may get this game and probably nag about how easy the bosses are well cry me a river , if you want a hardboss go play something els ... .other then that get ready to play one of the best games ever ... Overall Super Mario 64 stands up on its own . The game was indeed revolutionary and braught us amazing visuals , superb gameplay and great controlls aswell as a fun adventure/like plot with lots of collecting to do . The games music was just great to listen to , the places the game takes you are just so fun and innovative and the moves/mechanics that are enabled for Mario ( though limited ) are great ! The game is just plain great ! As I stated before , it is one of the best video games ever made and it indeed gets a perfect5 out of 5 stars ... ..	1
The Mario series from Nintendo has consistently produced games that are refreshing and innovative , not to mention extremely addictive and fun to play . First there was the original Super Mario Brothers and Super Matio Brothers 3 for the NES , to Super Mario World for the SNES , and now Super Mario 64 for the N64 . The game is 5 years old now , but it 's still just as fun to play as ever . The graphics and sound make excellent use of the N64 's capabilities to create a 3D world that was just jaw-dropping in 1996 and is still pretty awesome today.As others have said , the basic story of the game is classic Mario : Bowser has kidnapped the Princess , and Mario must rescue her . To do this , he must collect a minimum of 70 stars from the 15 worlds in the game . These worlds are accessed by jumping through paintings and other objects scattered throughout the Mushroom Castle , plus there are 15 stars contained within the castle itself . Although you only need 70 stars to finish the game , there are a total of 120 stars available for collection , and you wo n't be satisfied until you have collected each one . The 15 worlds have varying levels of difficulty , but each and every world has some easy stars and some that are very difficult . It took me about 100 hours total to collect all 120 stars and rescue the Princess the first time . Each level has a different theme . Some are on mountains , some are in water-filled caves , and there is one set inside a giant clock . My personal favorite is the haunted house level.The gameplay in Mario 64 is exceptional . Mario has many different types of moves , ranging from tiptoeing around sleeping enemies , to a great long jump , to a very difficult-to-master wall jump . You must master all the moves if you expect to get all 120 stars . Also , there are three special hats scattered throughout the game that allow Mario to fly , walk underwater , and become invisible . Again , all are vital for 120 stars.After you finally win , you might expect that you will never want to take on such a huge task again . But , such is not the case . Even though you have all 120 stars , you can go back to levels you have beaten and play them over and over , as much as you want . You 'll be tempted to do just that . The experience of playing through the incredible world of the Mushroom Castle is such that you will be coming back for many repeat visits .	1
This is easily the best game I 've ever played . I played it back when it was first released for the N64 and at the time there was nothing else like it on any of the other platforms . It led the way for 3d gaming which is of course the norm now . To this day I still get nostalgic and pop the cartridge in on occasion just to run around in the various worlds . The graphics still look pretty good and the game play is still fun . A simply incredible game .	1
What a great game , I like it alot . The only problems I found were:1 : It gives off way too many hints to how to complete a puzzle or beat a boss ( EXAMPLE : On the first time you fight Bowser , he says `` Can you get behind me and grab my tail ? I think not ! `` 2 : Moving around is kinda stupid because Mario ca n't move to the different direction fast enough and he slips on the floor when he moves.Other than these flaws , this is a solid title that deserves to be in your collection .	1
Right off the bat , before it came out , you 'd probably wonder how would you ever imagine Mario in 3D . Well , here 's your answer : Mario 64.There 's 15 huge courses with 7 missions in each ( Counting 100 coin stars ) , with stars for rewards . Those stars help you unlock more levels.At the time , no one ever saw anything like this before . Although the graphics look fairly primitive now , they were still eye candy for most Mario fans , especially back then.Super Mario 64 plays how a 3D game should be played like : With a free camera , flawless control , and extremely playable environments.Getting all 120 stars is the real challenge . ( SPOILER ALERT ) If you do manage to get them all , you get to visit Yoshi on the castle roof and he will give you 100 lives along with an improved triple jump move.Overall , you know what I want you to do , so do it . Buy the game	1
Id like to say this game is surprisingly easy ( thats a good thing ) if you play all the cards right.I got in July of this year and beat it today.The game has great visuals and music and I cant be the only one who feels a tinge of sadness when the screen says The End.I get the feeling not because its a disappointment ( it isnt at all ) but because it was a real great game with a real great story.Thats also why I like playing it again and again.Nintendo 64 isnt the best Nintendo system of all time ( that title belongs to Game Cube ) but Mario 64 is one of the greatest games ever made.I feel anxious to put more N64 games into my collection.Ones like Ocarina Of Time , Banjo Kazooie and Majora 's Mask . The N64 was slightly disappointing because there just arent enough quality games for it but Id be lying if I said it doesnt have at least 4 classics.Still the time has come for you to get a Game Cube.Namco 's Museum is out for it so is Super Mario Sunshine , Metroid Prime , Sonic Mega Collection , Star Fox Adventures , Super Smash Bros Melee , Resident Evil , Super Monkey Ball 1 and 2 and upcoming attractions.Dont be afraid to buy a new Nintendo system but remember to keep the N 64 always .	1
A fun game all the way ! ! You just ca n't get enough of this fantastic wonderful game ! ! ! ! ! !	1
love it the kids love it and its not xbox 360 lol moms and dads and some grand parents would love it too .	1
This is it ! The ground breaking game that shot the Nintendo 64 sells thorough the roof and off to space ! Super Mario 64 is a game that cant be found anywhere else ! It is truly amazing in every aspect from stunning graphics to superbly versatile gameplay . I just couldnt believe that this game could be this good even though it is so old ! ( yes , it is OLD now ! ) This game was so dang much fun that they even made it for Nintendo DS ! If you are looking for one amazing game and own the best system ever made ( Nintendo 64-NOT Xbox , Playstsion 2 , or Xbox 360 ) then look for Super Mario 64 . You will not be dissapointed . Guaranteed !	1
We had this game before and as the years went by , it became defective . After searching and searching it finally became available and we had to get it .	1
My six year old grandson has had many hours of enjoyment especiall after receiving this cartridge and his console which shipped in another order . Everything was smooth and merchandise arrived in excellent condition and in time prescribed .	1
This game is fun , but do n't expect a classic Super Mario game . This one is way diffrent than any other Mario game before it , but still great in it 's own way .	1
This is a great classic game that basically revolutionized Nintendo 64 but there is only one problem . It is WAY too easy to beat . But I guess since it 's an old game I can see why.Basically the `` mission '' is to recover all the 120 stars and save the Princess from the evil `` Bowser . '' It 's really easy and you can beat the game in about a month . Even though I have plenty of Nintendo games , I still go back to this game once in awhile because it 's a classic favorite . Many current Nintendo games ca n't compete against it . If only this game was a bit more challenging ! ! I think all new Nintendo 64 buyers should get this as there first game because you can explore alot with controls and skills that 'll help you out in more challenging games.Any fans of Mario , or Nintendo genre would like this game . As far as kids , there is n't much violence in this game . No blood , or gorey actions . The price is pretty ok , and the game 's plot is pretty ok . There are many courses and places to explore so if you are a slow player it 'll take some time . After you complete the game , you 'll still be going back to it . Seeing that my brothers and I already beat it over 10 times , we 're finally getting tired of it !	1
Stupid Sony ... they forced 3D games out before anybody was ready . Nintendo was forced to cancel many Super Nintendo games ( Doom FX , Star Fox 2 , Mario FX ) and release the Nintendo 64 . Many popular 2D games failed in full 3D . Castlevania , Mega Man ... they failed and have not been revived . Did Mario succeed ? YES ! This game is a legend . I heard about it in 2009 ( not 1996 ) in a Nintendo Power magazine simply titled `` Mario '' . I did not own a Nintendo 64 ( this was 2009 ) . The only system I had was an original Wii that we used for Mario Kart . I was somehow able to persaude my parents to buy me a Wii Point Card with 2000 points on it ( enough for Mario 64 and Super Mario Bros 3 ) . I downloaded it and was greeted with a happy Mario face that said `` HELLO ! '' . Soon I was distorting him to where he had no moustache and had big ears . Then I started the game and got a message from Peach . In her girly princess voice she read the letter , which told Mario she had baked a cake for him . The plumber could not resist and jumped out of a warp pipe onto the castle grounds . I had never played a 3D Mario Game . I stuck to Animal Crossing , Mario Kart , My Sims , and Wii Sports ( I was 8 years old ) . After a little bit of exploring I entered the castle . Instead of a cake Mario got a scary message from Bowser ( Who ate cake , I guess ) . Soon I was hiking up a hill to meet a giant king bomb complete with a moustache and crown . He told me ( using fancy king words ) that in order to get the bomb I had to defeat him . I defeated him and moved on to the next level , a giant fortress ran by slabs of concrete with faces . Then I started level 3 , a snow level . What a level that was ! Finding baby penguins , building snowmen , sliding down a slide . Then my parents walked in . My mom said `` YUCK ! What are those dots supposed to be ? '' . Those dots were snow flakes . My dad said `` Are those graphics ... 64 bit ? '' I had not even realized the graphics were bad because I was lost in the creative levels . Each level had an original design with interesting puzzles and obstacles put in the way of the star . Each boss was different and interesting . The graphics are outdate , so what ? This , along with Mario 3 , really changed my view of video games . Now ( in 2012 ) I have almost no respect for high-powered consoles like the Xbox 360 . Kids should play these old games . How hard is it to get kids a $ 20 card so that they can enjoy a unique classic like this ? The challenge is not too much . If you get stuck on one level you can try another . This is a beautiful game that put the Nintendo 64 to its limits .	1
When this game came out , it was like a historic event . It felt like there was no longer a limit to what video games could do . Every toy store had a booth set up where you could give this game a try . It was amazing to play and amazing to see.This game is still amazing . The play control is amazingly smooth , and you can make mario do some unbelievable things . The worlds are amazing . You can go wherever you want to go , do whatever you want to do.Just look at the difference between this game , and the original Super Mario Bros. for NES . My gosh , the difference is astounding . It 's amazing how Nintendo could take something so great and make it hundreds of times better in less than two decades . Sometimes I love progress .	1
When `` Super Mario 64 '' was released ten years ago , it was instantly the best video game ever created . Simply put , playing this game was a magical , imagination/mind-opening experience ; almost a mystical one , in fact . This euphoric feeling and sense of awe that we felt the first time we played this game would never again be matched , at least up until this stage in the video game realm . What made it so amazing was the fact that Mario , who had only existed in 3D in our minds as kids , had now become like the cartoon character we watched on the `` Super Mario Brothers '' cartoon . The days of Nintendo 's rule were the great ones in video games , and it 's a shame that kids nowadays wo n't get to grow up with Mario like us generation x-ers . Every Mario game , for me , was truly magical , but Super Mario 64 was truly revelatory . I spent years of my life playing this game ( literally ) , and still play it more today than another other game available , for any other system . Unfortunately , this was one of the few true masterpieces for the Nintendo 64 , and Sony took over with the PlayStation . For me , however , Nintendo and Mario are what video games are all about , and Super Mario 64 was the pinnacle of the entire industry .	1
One of the best games of its time , and is still considered by many to be one of the best games ever made . I highly recommed this game .	1
I remember the first time I laid eyes on this game . I had been hearing about how awesome the Nintendo 64 was going to be from schoolmates as we eagerly anticipated the USA release of this system . I remember hearing how in demand it was and the ensuing shortage for the upcoming Christmas before I even saw it . Then one day I was Christmas shopping with my dad and happened to come across a demo set-up in the mall , and I finally got to see what the massive hype was about.The game was bright and colorful , and Mario was fully 3D . A large crowd had gathered around to catch a glimpse of the latest in video game technology , and I only lingered for a moment , yet my first impression is still fresh in my memory . Mario 64 looked like nothing I had ever seen before , and also looked leaps and bounds better than anything I had ever seen on Playstation , Sega Saturn or any other system . I was very impressed.Several months later , I finally saved up enough money to purchase the system bundled with Mario 64 . I loved the game dearly back then , and to this day I still love this game . It still looks , feels and plays unlike any other game that came out during that era . While Zelda Ocarina of Time is similar graphics-wise , that game is so great in it 's own right that both games deserve to be recognized separately.Mario 64 is a perfect launch game for the Nintendo 64 home console system . Looking at the controller for the N64 , one might have been understandably skeptical due to the layout . However , Mario 64 is actually very easy to control and is a good introduction to getting gamer 's accustomed to the new feel of the controller and it 's new button layout.When I say the controls for this game are very simple , I must also mention that Mario is capable of many actions . Mario can walk , run , crawl , jump , triple jump , backflip , side somersault , wall kick , swim , climb , punch , kick , slide , fly , shoot from a cannon , butt-splash , hang , hand-over-hand , crouch , surf on koopa shells , and even look around . While this scope of actions seems like a lot and likely difficult to master , the reality is that yes , it is alot but is not difficult at all to master . A few of the skills , such as wall kicking or flying take some practice to master , but the majority of Mario 's actions are very easy to master , which results in very fluid gameplay and the sensation of actually being Mario.The camera angles are manageable considering you have control over them . You might find yourself slightly frustrated with it in certain enclosed areas ( such as Boo 's Haunted House ) but for the most part , the camera angles are very functional . The gameplay is extremely fun with a very gradual learning curve . While you only need 60 stars to complete the game , players looking to one-up the challenge can elect to try and collect all 120 stars , which requires true mastery of the game.The music is outstanding . Koji Kondo , also famous for the Ocarina of Time music , did all the music for Mario 64 and succeeded in composing very memorable and enjoyable tunes . My personal favorite is and will always be the Jolly Rodger Bay / Dire Dire Docks music.The level design is unique with some truly large levels offering tons of exploration . Mario will find himself in sunken ships , caves with toxic gas , inside a volcano , a pyramid , in a desert , a fortress in the sky , sliding down slippery snowy slopes , and even inside a giant strange clock . This game is filled with fun challenges and hours of terrific gameplay . I do n't believe I 've ever met anyone that did n't find this game fun to play.No , Luigi is not in the game . There was a major hoax citing ridiculous methods that would unlock Luigi , but all proved untrue . Kind of strange Luigi was n't in the game , but not that big of a deal.Mario 64 is well loved and remembered , but it is kind of strange that the Nintendo 64 's launch game is almost incomparable to the entire library of games that followed . Super Mario World on Super Nintendo was a gem , but there were other great games in the SNES library . However , with the Nintendo 64 , Super Mario 64 along with Zelda Ocarina of Time stand head and shoulders above pretty much every game in the Nintendo 64 library , which is disappointing considering that we see the Nintendo 64 was capable of supporting top-notch games . The Nintendo 64 library just did n't manage to produce games that lived up to the original launch game.In the end , Mario 64 will always be remembered as the revolutionary classic that literally defined the Nintendo 64-bit era .	1
15 years later , still a great game.This is a classic in every sense of the word.It not only redefined the Mario Franchise . it redefined 3D gaming.It is a must have it you still own a N64 .	1
i found this game to be a challenge at first , used to the old side-scrolling games of mario it took some time to get used to the fact its now in 3D.if you like mario you will love thi 3D game .	1
REGISTER NOW ! UsernameBy now , many Mario fans have taken a look at either the Japanese or U.S. version of Super Mario 64 , so we 'll spare you ( most of ) the hype and rhetoric . Having said that , it must be stated that SM64 is the greatest videogame to date , and one which all games , regardless of genre , will be judged henceforth . Nintendo set itself a nearly impossible goal and achieved it with SM64 . Look closely , Mario 's lineage is 2D -- not ideal material upon which to base the most intensely scrutinized 3D videogame ever . But videogames are , in the end , meant to entertain . And entertainment is at the heart of this fantastic title.Like many previous Mario games , experimentation is integral to the experience of playing . You must explore everything , leave no rock unturned , no mushroom mute , no door unopened . Mario himself has so many possible movements , and the environment is so intensely interactive , that even the least experimental players will spend hours on the first level without achieving anything in particular . The game is initially less accessible than previous Mario titles , although the three-pronged analog controller is n't really where the difficulty lies -- the joypad itself performs excellently . Overall , the biggest obstacle in the game is finding the correct viewpoint . The camera , which moves on its own ( unless directed manually by using the four gold buttons ) , tries to find the optimal angle to view the action , though occasionally you 're simply not able to see where you 're going . Additionally , frustration sets in as you spin the camera around while simultaneously attempting to run across a moving plank or tip-toeing across a tiny ledge . But getting the hang of SM64 is all a matter of practice , and as soon you catch on , you will execute these skills unconsciously . The variety of levels and scale each world is simply breathtaking . The game consists of 15 massive courses in which Mario can attain seven stars per course , with numerous secret areas and bonuses , including 15 extra stars ( for a total or 120 stars ) . It 'll surely take the average gamer 60 hours to reach the third and final Bowser and free the princess ( not to mention find Yoshi ) , so the game 's replay value is bountiful . And despite all of their saccharin-sweet cuteness , the graphics are magnificent . Shigeru Miyamoto 's dream of producing an interactive cartoon has been fully realized -- the animation is lavish , the textures rich , and even the most superfluous touches have been completely executed . SM64 is not perfect , however . Despite the efficiency of the hardware 's Load Management , draw-in is noticeable , and occasionally gamers will look right through walls or objects . Still , this is as close to perfection a game has ever been ( 64-bit , no less ) . Super Mario 64 also puts Nintendo 's preference of & quot ; silicon over CDs & quot ; to the test , with pleasingly familiar results . Most owners of either a Saturn or a PlayStation ( or both ) , have by now acclimated to long load times , though grumblingly . Super Mario 64 will remind them of how gaming used to be : load time is nil , and reaching a playable level is only a matter of seconds . From the time you switch on the unit until you 're done , the flow is seamless , and moving from one game area to another is instantaneous . Nintendo 's musical prodigy , Koji Kondo , turns in an inspired performance , somehow finding room on the small cartridge to create the appropriate music for each world . Even though some tracks are cheesy , others , like the sitar-laden score of the first fire level , are more than effective in setting the mood for the level , and are as atmospheric as any Redbook audio . Also impressive are the sound effects : Mario 's onscreen antics are matched by grunts , whoops , and hollers , fleshing out his spunky personality . As a whole , the flagship N64 game more than makes up for any painful delay ( or delays ) imposed upon the unit 's release . SM64 is complete in every way , and the challenging experience of working toward each new level is far greater than the game 's minimal flaws . Nintendo 's craftsmanship and zeal for creating fantastically enjoyable games has never shown through more than in Super Mario 64 . Nintendo 64 's early flagship title demonstrates the power of the hardware as well as the creative genius of Miyamoto and team . Not only does the game obliterate every platformer before it in terms of visual finesse , it plays just as well if not infinitely better than previous 2D incarnations of the Mario franchise . 3D worlds are huge and cleverly laid-out so that there 's never a dull moment . Secrets play a huge part of the experience , recapturing the classic gameplay style of the series . In fact , this game is exactly as one might hope it would be : Mario in 3D . More freedom , more space , more options , better graphics , improved and elaborated control schemes -- it 's all there . Possibly the greatest videogame achievement ever . Do n't rent . Buy .	1
great graphics , good gameplay . if you want a challenging game , get this one . its kinda hard , it 'll keep you busy for a couple of weeks .	1
This game is great ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I played a friends , and then they gave it to me.. Ive beat it ! ! I still have to try to get all the stars , but I will ! ! The game is REAL fun and interactive with many great lands and levels to get the stars , and fun bosses ! ! The game is just REALLY great , I really love it ! ! IT ROCKS ! ! ! !	1
Super Mario 64 ( 1997 ) When I first got Nintendo 64 , it came with Super Mario 64.When the system was hooked up , I put in the game , and was amazed on how the graphics were ! It was excellent.The graphics were great , the music was cool , and Mario never looked better ! This game is for everyone.I thought Banjo-Kazooie was a great game , but move over Banjo , Mario is back ! The best game ever.Features new worlds , characters , setting , and do n't worry some of the old villians from the early Mario games are here , and ca n't forget Bowser and Princess Toadstool ( Peach ) .Better than any 64 game ever made !	1
I love this game . I have overall , like I said , 4 out of 5 , highly recommend it to anyone who loves great games and platformers .	1
Why is this on the list , because for the time it was the cream of the crop . And its also one of the funnest Mario games you 'll ever play . The worlds look great , lots of free roaming and neverending gameplay is why this game makes the list . Still love it . ''	1
Super Mario 64 is one of the best games ever.It 's a classic , no Mario fan should be without it.Now , onto the reveiw : Controls:9.5/10It 's pretty good compaired to some games , but most games have much smoother control.But since this is one of the first N64 games , I 'm going to give it a good rating considering there are no PS2s , GCs , or Xboxs.There 's mario 's famous jump , double jump , and triple jump.The double and triple jumps can be performed by timing when you press the A button.There is also the groundpound aka buttstomp and other confusing jumps.Also , Mario can pick up and throw various items , climb walls using the wall jump , and punch and kick.The reson why this game 's getting a 9.5 is because some jumps can be hard to master , and controlling Mario can sometimes be hard.Graphics:10/10Like I said : This is one of the first Nintendo 64 games ! So , it 's okay that the graphics are a little blocky and not very detailed.The graphics are very well done.Replay Value:7/10The point of the game is to retrieve all of the castle 's power stars and save princess Peach.There are 120 in all.You only need 70 to beat the game.Sure , it 's fun to go back and beat the game a couple more times.But how much time are you going to spend getting all 120 ? Some stars are very hard to get , and after a couple of times , you might get frusterated and just give up ! Overall:10/10Super Mario 64 is a brilliant game.Mario can be turned into metal Mario , invisible and fly by wearing special caps that last a certain amount of time.He can shoot from cannons and swing Bowser around by the tail.The courses are cleverly designed , everything is almost perfect.I use the word `` almost '' because nothing is perfect .	1
Perhaps SC3K 's main problem is that it is far too detailed . Even on a speedy top-end machine the screen will fill with portions of white if you try to scroll at one of higher resolutions . Perhaps this is also SC3K 's main virtue - the fact that you can see down to the last person in your metropolis . Whatever you say , despite the game 's vast graphical and not-so-vast strategic advances , it failed to do what the fans of the series held closest to their hearts - personalization . The city develops completely at random within your zonal confines - you can not make a candleshop district , a Downtown , or anything of the sort . You can not name streets , despite the fact that you place them yourself . The papers mention you rarely and glancingly , at best , preferring to metion senseless rock bands ( whose names you can not supply either ) or some other uneventful thing . The advisors are as helpful as ever - specifically , useless . They either take no notice of the trouble befalling your city , or they take notice of something very minor and blow it up to the size of a scandal . THE 1 % COMMERCIAL TAX IS KILLING THE CITY ! REMOVE THE PARKING FINES ! All the while industry fails to develop and a major power outage goes unnoticed.This game is a cleaner , crisper version of SimCity 2000 , perhaps an update , but in no way a new game in the series .	1
I enjoy playing this game for the most part . I have spent hours glued to the computer watching my cities grow . Unfortunately as the cities increase in population , so does the chances of the computer crashing - a very annoying problem . Also the parades last too long , the seaports are difficult to develop , the terrain for some cities , such as St. Louis , are unusually hilly , and the buildings look alike . The game is not that challenging . But overall a recommended game .	1
Ever since I got this game I 've loved it , i lost it so i recently had to buy another one , but you get the hang of things pretty quickly ... very very fun game !	1
Talk about being able to play a game forever , this seems to be the case with SC3000 . This game is well done , with many features , controls , interfaces , and ultimately , complete control for you the Mayor . I have played this game over and over and built incredible cities like New San Francisco . I know you will experience tons of fun when you buy this one .	1
Making a City , it 's a change for once . I like this game because it gives easy control , and it 's fun to play . There are some down-sides to it too , like it takes too long to make a big city , and Sims complain tooooo much , but it 's all good other then that . My favorite thing to do is save the city , then rip it down by disteasters . The good thing is you do n't have to save it after you destory it . This game can be easy or hard , like if you want to make a big city , it takes time , and it 's hard , but if you use codes like : I am weak , Call coison Vinnie , I love Red Tape , Power to the masses , Water in the desert , Garage in garage out , and nardz rool ( actually spelling ) it 's eazy ( ... ) . Graphics , well it is n't that good on making small sims , but good on everything else , 9/10 Fun , a very fun game , is n't has fun as some games , but it 's cool,7/10 Gameplay , well , if you like making cities , then it has long gameplay , 8.5/10 Sound , I really like the sound because it makes me think more,9.5/10 Overall , you would love this game , but it 's fun is n't like some games 8.5/10 which is Great/Awesome and 4 stars for Sim City 3000 !	1
When you first buy this game , you will need to give it time . Reading the Manual first just might be alot of help . The game starts out in pause mode . This gives you time to zone space for roads , residental & amp ; commercial or indutry zones , water pipes and electrical wires . It times take to know the best way to zone RCIs . It 's not easy and money can disappear fast so do n't go crazy zoning everything and destorying things , it will cost you . It sum this review in one sentence . It takes time to build a perfect city so try different approaches and eventually your get it right .	1
First off , let me clear up some misstatements about the features listed above by amazon.com : *Realistic 3-D environmentWrong . The game is 2D , it merely looks 3D . It IS realistic , however . There is far more detail in 2D than could ever have been done in 3D and still hae it run on everyone 's machine . *View cities from up to 50,000 feetI guess ... you have 5 zoom levels . The above implies that you can zoom to any level . *Detailed control over businesses and other facilitiesNone whatsoever other than being able to zone blocks of residential , commercial , and industrial areas , along with other specialized zones . You ca n't micromanage any individual businesses . *Everything and everyone movesCars and SimCitizens move , so do some animated buildings , but certainly not EVERYTHING . *Optional load-in sets for customization and enhancementsThat 's handled much better in SC3K Unlimited.SimCity 3000 is a mixed bag for me . I love being able to play a fully updated version of 2000 , but whether it should be called 3000 or 2100 is something of a dilemma.Graphics-wise , 3000 is beautiful ! No two ways about it . A lot of hype has gone into the fact that you can now zoom in and see little sims walking , driving around in individual cars , and so on . The building images are now fully 4-sided entities so that rotating the view yields 4 different looks at each feature . Five zoom levels let you choose the size you 're comfortable with to build on . Some people claim that the buildings are blocky and pixellated at the highest zoom . I do n't have that problem , but they are definitely not the crisp renders that the other 4 zooms are . They are merely enlargements of the 4th zoom . Vehicles and pedestrians remain crisp and distinct at any zoom.Gameplay : here 's the sticking point for me . If you 've continued to play SimCity 2000 until you 're red-eyed and guaranteed to be late for work/school , you 'll probably do the same with 3000 . Given all the new bells and whistles , it 'll take some time to try them all and see how this affects that . From this point , however , two camps emerge . One camp will continue playing the game for years and loving every minute of it , relishing the freedom to create anything they want . I fall into this category . The other camp , once having seen everything and mastered building megalopoli at will , are going to wonder what 's the fun anymore . So depending on your expectations for the game it 'll be either a gift from heaven or something you may well have wished did n't cost 40 to 50 bucks.As for difficulty , it 's no harder really than 2000 . Some of the new features like garbage disposal , ordinances , and neighboring city dealings add depth and strategy without making the game unduly complex . Maxis should be commended for that.Overall ? It 's good . In fact it 's very good . They put a lot of work into it making sure everything balances more or less . Is it worth the money ? Not now with SC3K Unlimited out . Get it instead , as it 's much more refined . If you have n't played a SimCity game before or if you 're a diehard 2000 fan , absolutely . If you just sorta liked 2000 and quit playing it after a little bit , you may want to wait until it hits the bargain rack .	1
I can play this game comfortably on my old XP machine without a special video card . That 's worth a lot in my book . Not to mention the joy of spending most of my gaming time BUILDING rather than destroying . However , if you want , you can sick all kinds of crises and destroy the city if you want ... . sometimes that 's fun . This is a great strategy game .	1
Sim City 3000 is really cool ! You start off by making a Power Plant ( I prefer Fusion or Microvave ) , laying power lines , zoning Residentail , Commercail , and Industrial areas , disposing of garbage , Making Roads and/or a Mass Transit System , Make Water Structures and pipelines , and Take care of Civic needs . Later in the game you might want to enact some ordinances ( rules/laws ) , Make business deals with neighbors and organizations , set a budget ( earlier on the computer does it for you ) , build rewards which most of them can only be optained thru Business Deals ( ones optained without deal : county courthouse , Mayoral Mansion also know as you 're house , city hall , performing of arts center , and Monument/statue . ones optained thru deal : Gigamall , Amusement Park , Space Port , Defense Contractor , Country Golf Club , etc. ) . Plus you can add Landmarks to you 're City . This is a Great game , but for Sim City 2000 fans that want a totaly different game get the Unlimited Version ( also known as Sim City 3000 Unlimited ) .	1
one of my all time favorites for the n64 . in my opinion one of the best looking games for the system . if you like the genre and you 're interested in playing older games pick this one up . i know this game wo n't make many people 's short list , however , if you are into spaceships , lasers and are a huge nerd you 'll know you 'll like it . if you are not a fan of shooters do n't pick it up .	1
I did n't know that Star Soldiers is a remake from the early Nintendo game you can check it out on YouTube first if you like its a vertical 2D Shooter . Great game .	1
I 've had a great time with this one , you can pick from 3 alternative but well balanced ships , play with a comfortable control scheme , rake high scores and combos , use powerful special weapons , collect and preserve power-ups by staying alive , deflect shots by doing rolls and are complimented with a remarkable , engaging soundtrack . The power-ups are what make this game stand out because the ships seem to upgrade almost endlessly until you 're firing more powerful and voluminous attacks.I mentioned the controls before : between the D-pad , rolling with the right-shoulder button , firing special attacks with the left-shoulder and B buttons and keeping hold on the A button and firing strategically to maintain a shot combo , it 's fun and easy to use . That being said , the missions in Vanishing Earth are n't easy by any means because you need to avoid hitting ships as well as being fired on and the bosses are particularly adept at relentlessly firing at you.However , players are offered consolation in that they can continue from the beginning of the mission after losing and can store a password if they 'd like ( personally , I enjoy staring over from the beginning so I can keep all the power-ups I earn ) . And even if you do n't want to play the whole game , there 's a fast 2 or 5 minute arcade-style mode where you earn as high a score as you can destroying enemy vessels with maximum power upgrade from the start.I had a lot of fun switching off with a friend but it 's good for single player as well . Not as flawless as Super Star Soldier and I mean that particularly with regard to the visuals of the area you fly over not being as outstanding but overall it still looks good enough not to harm the fun ; Vanishing Earth is also much easier to collect for than its TurboGrafx counterpart . If you can get the cartridge around 15 - 20 dollars , I say go for it because there 's hours of enjoyable content that will leave you coming back for more .	1
This game is amazing . The music makes you look forward to every fight , and the pace does n't let you blink . And yet you feel the artwork and the location you 're at . You 've got three highly distinct ships to use . List of them in order of difficulty : Easy : Red ship . Spread-shot Gatling gun that gets more shots in per level , but power never truly upgrades.Medium : Blue ship . Powerful pulse laser punches straight through enemies , and it gains spread upon the final level-up.Hard : Green ship . Spread shot eventually reaches a strategic half-moon shape that makes every shot count.It 's a shame that no other arcade shooters exist on the N64 , it could 've had other great games like RayStorm and G-Darius in a heartbeat !	1
I did not play this on N64 , but I did play it in the arcade ! It is such a wonderful and awesome game it is not even the least bit funny ! The graphics rock , the arenas are both cool looking and interesting , there are many cool moves each of the fighters have , and the endings are movies ! I have won this game four times , all four as none other than Scorpion , my favorite MK fighter ( 4 times I won MK4 ! Perfect fit ! ) . I love this game , it is cooler than nearly any game I know , there are some of the coolest fighters ever along with Scorpion in it , and I plan to get it for my computer . Period .	1
Despite mixed emotions from reviewers all over , Mortal Kombat 4 is an awesome fighting game . Taking the once 2-D game into 3-D now adds alot of depth . The game moves just as smoothly and as fast as the past games so , those who still have the 'twitch ' when it comes to fighting games , will feel right at home . I remember when I played this at the arcade at our local mall when it first came out . I went up against a 12 year old kid and got my tail kicked by him on it but I was tickled to just get to play it . I 'm tickled it 's out for the systems . Definitely worth checking out . Collect it if you can .	1
This was my a ; ll time favorite both on the arcade and at home . Great classic as far as fighting games went back in it 's time . Works wonderfully ! Thanks so much .	1
I like Nintendo 64 also I really enjoy watching the Mortal Kombat movies and playing the Mortal Kombat games Yeah ! !	1
Now I 'll be reviewing Mortal Kombat 4 which is hated by some some do like it they The MK Team was trying to change it with the times & I 'll admit it 's not as good as Mortal Kombat II , 3 , Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 or Mortal Kombat Trilogy it has it 's problems but I like it . MK 4 came out in The Summer of 1997 it was the last Mortal Kombat game to be in arcades most of the principle characters return Liu Kang , Raiden , Johnny Cage , Reptile Sub Zero & Scorpion . Goro returns which kind of pi s s es me off 1 he 's harder than he was in MK 1 or MK Trilogy 2 he was n't even in MK 4 . You fought Quan Chi as The sub boss . Jax & Sony are back . Some of the newer characters I did n't care for like Reiko he was a poor substitute for Noob Saibot but Noob is a secret character he has no ending though . Goro is another secret character & he has no ending so it 's pretty pointless . I hate Kai . Jarek is just another poor substitute for Kano . Ilike Fujin Quan Chi Tanya is alright . Shinnok is cool to play as . Story is Shinnok escaped The Neterreln thousands & thousands of years ago Shinnok was an Elder God he betrayed them he needs this powerful amulant . Raiden & Shinnok fought over it & ended with millions of people dying Shinnok was banished to The Neterreln . While The Invasion Of Earthrelm was going on Noob Saibot helped Quan Ch get Shinnok out of The Neterreln . Shinnok overtaken Edina takes Kitana hostage . Kitana is Liu Kang 's love of his life all around good time girl . So Liu Kang helps Raiden . Shinnok has killed most of The Elder Gods except for A Wind God Fujin . Quan Chi & Scorpion have a history he tells Scorpion yes that Sub Zero is lying about being a brother that he ready killed his clan & his family . Also Tanya a new fighter & Reptile join to help Shinnok . Tanya 's job is trap Liu Kang & have him killed & if you 're seen her ending she does it 's not official Liu Kang lives on until MK V. Shinnok agrees to send him back in time to his original race if he helps him Reptile is lied to again Since Shinnok is a fallen Elder God the battle can be won by Motals . Jax & Sonya are hunting down A Black Dragon guy named Jarek & if you have beat this game as Jax it 's a really bad a s s ending . The FMV endings look better on The PS1 . It 's not perfect the main boss Shinnok I Quan Chi should 've been the boss instead he 's in most of the endings . Nothing wrong with Shinnok I 'll say this he 's better than The Dragon King or Blaxe cause they were straight forward run of the mill monsters . But when you compare him to Shang Tsung or Shao Kahn he does n't measure up . The game has a lot of in your face gore . This game got ported to The Playstation & Nintendo 64 & an expanded version called Motal Kombat Gold on The Sega Dreamcast . The 64 version has the advantage that it 's a cartridge no load time but The 64 controller is n't made for fighting games . The Playstation version has better picture quality for the endings & you can get an arcade stick for it . I 've never played or have Dreamcast but I 've heard MK Gold is glitchy but Kung Lao , Baraka Kitana , are added I think it has Millena & Cyrax . I do n't know if MAME will run it . This woulalso be the last game Of The Boon Tobias era . Next is going to be an all time gulity pleasure Motal Kombat Anhillation .	1
This game is a few years old , of course , but I was so pleased with it that I played it all last night after it was shipped to me . Definitely the best fighting game for the fading N64 platform . It is somewhat easy on the easy settings ( almost too easy mind you ) , and as you increase the challenge level , the computer opponents increase in ability almost 10 fold.The only gripe that I have is that some moves are just not condusive to being made on the N64 controller . My hands also wanted to keep sliding over into the traditional n64 grip on the controller ( with the stick and not the pad ) , but this game does not play well with the stick and thus you have to use the pad . That will feel weird at first . You can re-map the buttons to better suite your needs , but if you do , other moves will be more difficult to pull off as well . For instance , Sub-Zero 's famous slide is almost impossible to do without taking your right hand off the controller and repositioning it on the correct buttons to make him do his slide . While you 're doing this , you 're getting your butt kicked because how are you going to concentrate on where the buttons are during the fight ? I still give it 5 stars because those problems are not really that significant in the long run . The combo system is wonderful , and anyone who is looking for a good fighting game on the N64 console should pick this one up . With the price that it is at now , it is very affordable too . I highly recommend it .	1
THIS IS A LITTLE SUPERIOR TO ITS PLAYSTATION VERSION . THE GRAPHICS ARE BETTER , THE CONTROLS ARE A LITTLE BETTER , AND IT 'S A LITLE MORE FUN . THIS IS A GREAT GAME . AND I THINK THIS SHOULD PLEASE ALL MORTAL KOMBAT FANS . IF YOU STILL HAVE YOUR NINTENDO 64 AND YOU DO N'T HAVE THIS GAME , GET IT NOW !	1
I had this game given to me for free years ago on the PC format . I liked it , but for some reason it crashed on me one day and I mustve done something to the disc , 'cause it never worked or would reinstall on any computer after that.All these years later I 've just picked it up , second hand , for the N64 . And I must say there is not really any difference between the PC version and the 64 version , which is a good thing ! The only difference is in the movies . The PC and I 'spose gaystation version had the movies & ending in video form , where as the 64 replicates them the same way using the polygons of the 3d characters themselves . I have no complaint about it , I like it wether it 's video form , or 3D poly form . They both still tell the same story . Except Reiko who just walks off into a portal.. the other versions show what happens when he goes into the portal , he puts on his Shoa Kahn mask ! ! ! ! shame thats not in it.All the codes and moves where the same , and I like the fact that the PRACTIVE mode allows you to press pause and choose a list that displays all the characters moves , fatalitys and weapens etc ... tho , i 'm really kind of sick of the combinations of move lifts , which makes it great to just go into the options , highlight `` continues # '' and hold down block+run untill it takes you to the hidden menu where you can turn on auto fatalitys and stuff.The only bad thing I can say about the game is what it should have had included . It needed to be fixed so that the auto fatalitys worked like in MK : TRILOGY ( All platforms EXCEPT the N64 version ) where each button freformed a diffrent fatality ( 2 fats , freindship , babality etc.. ) that about it.This game is one of the best head to head fighter games . Unfortunatly the team at Crapcom decided to make a billion versions of Street Fighter for every other system ... talk about over kill ... but they didnt wan na make one for the 64 , so thats there loss , which means Mortal Kombat is the best head to head fighter on the 64 if you ask me.This game is actualy converted to the 64 straight from the arcade and then extras where added in after that , which makes it better then the arcade . Like the fact you can play as Goro & Noobsaibot , and a skinless character named Meat ( go to GameFaq , com for the codes ) MK is the best head to head fighter on the N64 in this realm .	1
MK4 IS A SUPERIOR FIGHTING GAME . MY MOUTH IS WATERING FOR MORTAL KOMBAT DEADLY ALLIANCE . IN MK4 THERE ARE THE CLASSIC FIGHTERS ( SCORPION , SUBZERO , REPTILE , SONYA , LIU KANG & JAX ) . PLUS SOME FIGHTERS THAT WERE INTRODUCED IN THE FLAWED `` SUBZERO : MYTHOLIOGIES '' ( QUAN CHI & SHINNOCK ) PLUS NEW FOR MK4 ( TANYA , FUGIN , KIA , RECKO & JAREK ) THERE 'S A TOTAL OF 15 FIGHTERS WITH 2 HIDDEN FIGHTERS ( 17 ALL TOGETHER ) . THIS GAME MOVES VERY FAST IF YOU KNOW HOW TO PLAY IT . BUT UNTIL THEN YOUR FIGHTER MAY LOOK A LITTLE SILLY JUMPING AROUND WHILE YOUR GETTING THE HANG OF THINGS . PERSONALLY I LIKE THE MORTAL KOMBAT KOMBO SYSTEM AND OVER ALL FORMULA BETTER THAN ANY OTHER FIGHTING GAME . FAVORITE FIGHTERS R ' QUAN CHI , REPTILE , SUBZERO & LIU KANG . LEAST FAVORITES R ' ... OH I LIKE 'M ALL . WAN NA CHEAT MENU FOR EASY FATALITIES ? TRY THIS : GO TO OPTIONS , HIGHLIGHT 'CONTINUES ' HOLD BLOCK & RUN AT THE SAME TIME FOR ABOUT 5 SECONDS , YOU WILL HEAR `` OUTSTANDING '' CONTINUE TO HOLD THE BUTTONS FOR 3 MORE SECONDS . A MENU WILL APPEAR . NOW WHEN IT SAYS 'FINISH HIM ' YOU MAY PERFORM A FATALITY BY HOLDING DOWN & PRESSING THE B BUTTON .	1
The first time I played this game , I was in the mall and it was cool ! So I decided to get it when it came out . It 's a lot more different looking than MK Trilogy . It looks more realistic also . The title says it all ... ..	1
Mortal Kombat is a totally cool fighting game series . Digitized and bloody fighting combined with neck-breaking , spine-ripping fatality moves make the series seem like gold . But I personally find the transition from 2D to 3D for this series scary at first glance . I originally thought the fatalities would end up being like horror movie scenes . However , I ended up sticking with it.In Arcade mode , there were about 5 or 6 difficulty modes . In Mortal Kombat on the SNES , I played well on it . In Mortal Kombat 2 on Game Boy , I was able to tackle Hard mode . In Mortal Kombat 4 for Game Boy , I can beat Master mode , but that version of this game was too easy . Here , I got my butt kicked even on Normal mode ! The game is pretty challenging , but I think if a player 's good enough , he can whop through easily.The gameplay is traditional Mortal Kombat fighting action . There are also some new moves , such as twisting someone 's leg.The graphics are also really great , especially considering some of the Nintendo 64 's limits , such as the 2D blood during the Game Over screen.And of course , the sound is top-notch.There are very few fighting games for the Nintendo 64 , and this is your saving grace for your virtual strength .	1
Sup dawg . Let 's be serious here . I am not in any way the God who made Nintendo . I am however the God of BattleTanx . From exploding nukes , to mini howitzers , to the Flash being incarnated into a Tank . This game has it all . Call of Duty ai n't got a thing on this beauty . You can kidnap queens , you can dominate the world map , you can even stand around like a pacifist and let yourself die . This game has what YOU want . This game has what YOU need . YOU MUST OBTAIN BATTLETANX !	1
I picked this up the other day . It only took a few hours to finish the 1-player mode , but I suppose the fact that I 'd previously played BattleTanx : Global Assault on PS1 helped me out a little.Story : Some virus gets out of control and eliminates 99.9 % of the females on planet earth . This dude named Griffin is in love with this girl , and then the government comes and takes her away . Meanwhile , gangster militias that are armed with Tanks take over the US and likely the rest of the world . Griffin vows to get his girlfriend back and save America from the various Tank gangs.Gameplay : You play the entire campaign through in your stereotypical mock Abrams tank , blasting through enemy defenses and rescuing ( or kidnapping ? ? ? ) women . Your tribal army needs women to stay in existence . Different gangs have different types of tanks . There are a variety of powerups for your tank like swarmer missiles , guided missiles , lasers , and gun buddies you can set down to defend areas . Most of the missions remind me of a multiplayer session of `` Capture the Flag '' from any number of FPS games . BattleTanx 's single-player is unique in that regard.Controls : They work pretty good . No complaints.Multiplayer : There 's no co-op campaign . BOO ! : P You can play through various types of matches ( most of which resemble the single-player levels ) against friends or the AI . You can use the tanks of enemy games in the multi-player . That 's all good and well , I guess , but I know I can blow my friends to kingdom come . What I really wanted was to be able to play it through the campaign on 2 players.Graphics : They 're early N64 , but they look alright . I do n't like the fact that your main tank in single-player looks so cartoony . The comic-style storytelling is unique , and I think they 're way better than PS1 Global Assault 's campy voice-acting.If you 're a fan of the BattleTanx series , I suppose owning ( what I assume is ) the first entry is important . However , if I had to choose between this game and its sequel , I would choose the latter due to its better single-player campaign .	1
I Used to play this game with my dad all the time when I was younger ! I Actually ordered it recently to play with him again when my Nintendo 64 stopped working . Ha	1
The main game is ok , but the multiplay game is hella fun ! Grab a friend or two and play all night . I never get tired of Battletanx .	1
Buy it . Play Battlelord mode with four teams , preferably on the Las Vegas map . That 's about all you 'd do anyway . Do n't bother with the singleplayer , it 's garbage . I did n't bother finishing it . I played the first five or six levels , I 'd guess , and it was so easy and the story was so retarded that I just did n't care anymore . The multiplayer is where it 's at . Totally intense . You play as different factions , each one with a slightly different tank set ( there are only three kinds of tank -- Goliath , the generic kind , and a super fast little one w/ only machine guns , the tankset just determines how many of each you 'll get ... some are only goliaths or the little ones , and things like that ) . Each faction also has a special starting weapon . Guided missiles ( which are VERY good against base defenses since you do n't have to go in there and get pelted ) cloaking , shields , swarm missiles , etc.So , yeah , the multiplayer is simply amazing and the game is definitely cheap enough by now that if you see it you should buy it without question . Do n't worry about the graphics . You wo n't notice when you 're dodging guided missiles , goliath tanks , and mines trying to get the queenlord back to your base so you can win the round.Also , if you do get it , you might consider setting the control setup to DRIVER because the default control setup is kinda deplorable .	1
This game is great . You can either duel it out with up to 3 of you 're freinds ( plus you ) or do a single player campaign . Let me explain single player campaign first . A deadly virus kills 99 % of women in the game and so the National Guard takes the reamaining women to a Quarantine Zone . In the game , you are Griffin Spade and you must rescue Madison from the Federal Relocation Forces ( earlier reffered to as the National Guard ) . To progress in the game , you must destroy enemy tanks and bunkers , destroy enemy bases prior to rescueing the queenlords inside them ( the last base is the Quarantine Zone in Snfrinsisco ) , take the queenlords to you 're base via you 're tank , earn new types of Tanks as you progress ( Goliath , M1A1 , and a minature one ) , gain ally tanks by earning points ( note : you ca n't get ally tanks until after rescueing the first qeenlord ) , and gain Power Ups which provide you 're tank with sheilds , replacement armor ( if you 're tank gets damaged ) , weapons , and ammo . The capaign mode is really fun and has good replay value ( considering you can get more tanks if you get more points than you did lst time ) , but it 's still good to do multiplayer modes with freinds for both practice ( to prepair for campaign mode ) and fresh challenges ( if you 've beat campaign mode more than once ) . Plus campaign mode includes bonus rounds where you can earn extra points . Okay here 's a list of all the multiplayer modes : Deathmatch : You must be on you 're own against other players for this one , but you can get automatick gun terrets to assist you.Annilation : Depending on the gang you choose , you get a certain number of Goliaths , minature tanks ( similar in size to gun terrets , and of course , M1A1 's . Battlord : Simply steal enemy queenlords . Strategy is greatly involved as they 're are 3+ ways to get past a enemy Goliath tank ( fire guided missiles from your own base , move in and out fast with a moto tank , head on attack , lay mines on its track , or place a neough gun buddies to take it down . Defense measures include protecting your goliath tank , laying mine around your base , switching to goliath tank , or placing gun buddies .	1
I 'm not a fan of FPS 's by far . They 're one of my least favorite genres . But this game is just excellent , one of the best licensed games I 've had the joy of seeing.Unless you own a controller pak you ca n't save the game , and the controls can be hard to understand at first but it 's an excellent game .	1
OMG ! ! ! Seen it , wiped my eyes to see if it was real then of course bought and i have no regrets ! Highly love south park and this game is amazing and it came to me mint condition and i was happy ! !	1
South Park the video game is all right . I do n't think it 's smash worthy but I really do n't think it 's flush worthy either because it did probably one of the smarter things and totally copied 007 GoldenEye and gave it a total South Park twist.As usual , weird stuff is happening around South Park like mad , killer turkeys are attacking the city , strange mutants are running around and crazy self propelled toys are out to get you as you take the baddest 8 year olds on the planet Stan , Kyle , Kenny and Cartman on this strange , vulger and very gratuitous journey.I got ta say it , the game was funny and it made me laugh all the way through , especially if you ran across the Terrance and Phillip bombs ! Other than that , I really did n't feel there was much else besides all the cool codes ( like all the weapons codes and stuff ) and that you could be so many people in the multiplayer mode like Officer Barbrady , Mr. Mackey ( M'kay ) , Terrance and Phillip and if you really wanted to , Starvin ' Marvin.The story is really silly but then again , when is there an episode of South Park that is n't just plain out ridiculous ? Exactly . The controls are pretty easy too . You can set it to GoldenEye style of control or for you advanced users , you can use a Turok type of control.I still got ta say that I would n't play it for it 's story mode . Personally , I 'd play it for it 's multiplayer mode because that 's what the game is really good at ! That and I personally thought you could do a lot more in the vs modes rather than in the story modes.For you parents , most of the swearing is bleeped out but a few & quot ; choice & quot ; phrases are in there so give it a thought before you buy it for your kids . For those of you that do n't have to worry about that , order a pizza , call over a few friends and throw on some South Park multiplayer . Have fun !	1
I used to play this game years ago lol . The funniest foul mouthed 3rd graders stick it to the turkeys once and for all . From dart guns- pee drenched snow balls , this game is a good laugh for south park fans .	1
This is truly a funny game . It captures the feel of South Park with it 's cartoony style . The weapons are funny like snowballs ( 2nd fire- yellow snowballs ) to plungers . The voices from the show are funny . I recomend this game to any South Park fan out there .	1
This Game if so funny . Pee snowballs , annoying turkeys and it is in South Park , Colorado what more could you ask for . The controls are hard at first but in 10-20 minutes it becomes easy . The game is really fun and looks great on the 64 .	1
Super funny game . A little raunchy but hilarious all the while . May not be appropriate for younger kids . The story is fun to play yet predictable .	1
Sure , this game 's been out for alomost four years now , but it 's time I reviewed it . The exceptionally popular foul-mouth TV shows based on the fictional , yet epic adventures of Kyle , Cartman , Stan , and ( the now removed ) Kenny , four innocent little third graders ( now fourth ) in the snowy , mountain town of Colorado . It 's a wonderful life ; you have a gay teacher , a pimp-daddy chef , a best friend who dies more than 10 times a week , and all the Cheesy Poofs you could ever want . At least , until , killer turkeys , aliens , clones , and toys invade your town and try to take it over . YOU and YOU alon must prevent these attacks ( or you could just leave the worthless town to be burnt , but then the game 's no fun ) .Like all shooter 's , I only enjoy this game with cheats . The master cheat for this game is `` BOBBYBIRD '' , or , if you break it down , `` BOBBY BIRD '' . It unlocks every weapon , level , and everything else your twisted little mind wants from this game.In single-player , you assume the role of either Stan , Cartman , Kenny , or who I always pick , Kyle . Each comes with their own insults and comments . As you progress , you find Kenny , Cartman , and Stan , and they come with you , but you ca n't play as or with them . They just allow you to hold more weapons and item ( I guess that 's because it 's four pairs of hands ) . Your first mission is to destroy the turkeys ; and ultimatly , the gigantic , robo-turkey . Without cheats , you start with a snowball , or you can advance it , and make it a `` yellow snowball '' ( and if you 've seen Jackass , you know what that is ) . The other weapons are a cow launcher , a toy-machine gun , and more . Sooooo much more.This game is a good game , but only if you 're a fan of the TV show . Even though it would be fun if some people were n't , they 'd still annoy everyone , complaining of `` bad language '' and `` foul humor '' . Ignore them . If you 're a fan , get this , or at least rent it . Later .	1
I love South Park ! I remember walking around in middle school back in the 1990 's with the South Park shirts on and everyone talking about the new episode ! Times have changed but I still love South Park !	1
Now if you are a fan or those 2-D games and stuff like that , you probably will think this is a disgrace for the N64 . I thought this game was awesome . Especially the beginning , Forest Of Silence ! The music and sound effects are great and the game story is good . The controls may take a while to get used to but if you like games with a challenge , get this . I think that fighting skeletons gets boring after a while but I think when you get to higher levels , ( I 'm not sure of this ) there will be more vicious enemies to fight for your pleasure . I thought the game could have been a little more ... well ... .diverse and detailed , but where I am now , is awesome ! I have to say , I bought this at Fucoland and I had no idea I would like it this much . I rented it once before and I hated it because it was so hard . Really , I just did n't put my mind to it and look where I am now . I 'm in the 1st castle ! This is a great action-RPG game that will keep you hooked for hours . I would recommend that 10 and up should play this game because of the theme and the bloody scenes . There is n't much of a story to this game but for me , that 's okay . But for serious gamers ( I think I am but this game is so good that I do n't really care about the story ) you might be a little ticked off because of the lack of story . There many levels for you to get through and they all take a long time . The Forest Of Silence took me about 3 hours to figure everything out ( no cheats no guide no nothing ) . There are two charaters to chose from . Reinhart and a girl ( I forgot her name ) . Now Reinhart has a sword and a whip to fight off enemies and to destroy other things . I think he is better than the girl because he has a stronger weapon . The girl has a energy ball that takes 2 seconds to charge up . I do n't like that because if an enemy is comming towards you , you have to charge . She also has these two ... .rings they look like . She uses that to slice things , just like Reinhart 's sword . There are two modes you can go through . Easy and Normal . Normal is not that hard but there is quite a difference between that and easy . There are some options that you can do like the controls and stuff . As I mentioned before , their is n't much of a storyline but when you start the game , there is some . So that makes the game better . Be prepared to do a lot of jumping.Overall , this game has great sound effects , music , weapons , items , charaters , abilities , an okay storyline , excellent graphics and just a really good play !	1
`` Castlevania 64 '' offers you the experience of seeing a Castlevania adventure in a free-roaming , 3-D realm . I have played every Castlevania game right back to the NES days , and this is a good addition to a fine series . This is a great game , but not as good as `` Castlevania : Symphony of the Night '' for Playstation.To start on a positive note , there is a lot of depth added thanks to the 3-D graphics . You can roam freely , battle monsters face-to-face , and search for hidden items without the constraints of side-scrolling . The control is responsive , and the buttons are easy to figure out , which is good considering the pace of the game . The 3-D worlds are huge , and are fun to explore . The sound is also excellent . You can hear the clatter of bones , the snapping of jaws , and the cracking of whips clearly , without that horrible distortion that we all remeber from earlier installments.The cons of this game are mostly technical , nothing to do with the graphics or storyline . First of all , the camera can be a servere pain sometimes . It often lingers when you do n't want it to , and the response time for panning and scanning is pertty bad.The control is good , but sometimes it is clunky when you need to perform delicate movements . I remember the first level when I kept falling into the water and dying when I tried to jump from one ledge to another and missed by one inch . Also , a map would be helpful . Certain areas look the same as others , and sometimes , I can not tell where I have been and where I am going . But as I said , these are more technical flaws . They do n't exactly ruin the game.Overall , this game is fun , and gives a whole new depth to the long-running series . But as good as this is , `` Castlevania : SOTN '' for Playstation is much better .	1
I was really eager to see this installment in the Castlevania series . Mainly because of it 's venture into 3-D. Well , I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised . They were able to pull off a pretty decent game and that , in itself , makes it another great effort from Konami . It really reminded me alot of the older Castlevania games , yet in 3-D . Despite others mixed feelings on the game , I really enjoyed it . My only gripe , however , is that it was hard and frustrating at times with its ' platform areas in levels . Once I made it pass those parts , it was great . One , in my opinion , that was worthy of my hard earned dollar . Although I love the 2-D Castlevania games a great deal , I do hope they make another game like this one in the future .	1
This game still creeps me out ! It 's really fun to have those memories come flooding back as I whip my way through skeletons .	1
This game in my opinion is the best of all the castlevania series so far except maybe legacy of darkness . The soundtrack is awesome . The graphics are very well done and it gives you a sense of being there and actually relaying the fear instead of being dull and boring . Also you have to at least rent this game the cinema scenes are awesome !	1
I have always wanted to play this game since it 's release . However , due to money restraints and the negative reviews I heard about it , I did not get it . Years later , I decided to finally try it out after watching videos of it on youtube . I was actually impressed , and wished I had played it years ago . It is fun to play . Although it is a bit choppy in control , and the camera angle is somewhat annoying , this is a fun game .	1
castlevania 64 is one of the greatest games in the world a true classic the best of the best buy this game if your a castlevania fan you wont be sorry	1
Extremely difficult to play unless you 're an expert . Great graphics . Problem with this video game is that it does get old after maybe an hour or so . Many levels to conquer . I 'd only recommend this game to those who have plenty of patience . You know , the SAME kind of patience you need to have while on Ebay just waiting for a posted item 's time to run out while them other 'have no-life ' buyers often snipe the item YOU wanted SO badly in the last fifteen seconds . That kind of patience .	1
I used to own this game , and while it is not the game I miss most , I still do think about it from time to time . The visuals are very good for the N64 's graphics engine , and the voice acting , though there is n't a whole lot , is pretty good . The control is a bit of a problem , as is the camera . However , this is not a big surprise , for it is the first time the series of Castlevania has been moved to the third dimension . Then again , other series did n't really have that much trouble in the third dimension ( Zelda , Mario , Final Fantasy , Breath of Fire , etc . ) , but you ca n't always win , can you ? The music is awesome ( naturally-it 's Castlevania ! ) The sound effects are also good . The boss design is highly unique as well , and most importantly , IT 'S FUN ! I bought it for a mere $ 20 , and it was actually worth it . Though I have sold it , I might try and purchase a friend 's copy . If you are looking for a game that is a bit more simplistic in design than the classic Castlevania titles , then this is your ticket for sure .	1
Evil has once again awakened in the dark prince 's palace.With alot of bad guys and 10 hard to beat levels , and do n't forget our stars of the game , a brave , kicking butt little girl , Carrie.And a brave young whipping man , Reinhardt.This game will keep you on your tippy toes.You explore an old huge house , Dracula 's castle , the forest , and even places you would only see in your nightmares.This game is for 11 and up due to strong bloody violence.Great music and setting.This is a game you can sink your teeth into !	1
classic game for the ps1 . i love it and it still makes me smile like it did when i was a kid . the new verisions cant compare to the original ! whether you are a 90s child trying to relive your childhood or want to share it with the new generation , you will have hours of fun with everyone 's favorite purple dragon	1
I was feeling nostalgic so I bought this game along with a few others to relive my childhood . It 's as much fun as I remember ! There 's always plenty to do , from finishing levels to completing timed flight races . Even if you beat the final boss in the game , you can keep playing to collect all the gems and find all the dragons . Once you do that , you get to open up new content ! Even at 100 % complete , there 's STILL more to do , not to mention the replayability of the game is superb . Definitely worth the buy !	1
I 'm very reluctant to try the new Spyro game for PS2 , or to buy the Spyro games available for Xbox because Spyro games have stooped to such a low quality I 'm afraid to play them . But for the old Spyro games on PSone I have no fears because these ones were developed by Insomniac ( Ratchet and Clank , Resistance : Fall of Man ) , the studio that made the good ones , but sadly no longer makes them . The story is about how Spyro has to rescue all of the dragons who have been imprisoned in crystal cocoons by Nasty Nork . The gameplay functions very well for an old platformer , and never really gives you much trouble because of how smoothly it handles . The flight mechanic works well , but you ca n't use it all the time . The graphics look nice for the time , but are feeble by today 's standards . The environments are bright and colorful and still have a great feel to them . You will spend your time defeating lots of enemies , rescuing your dragon friends , collecting jewels , finding hidden locations , getting health by letting your dragon fly buddy eat butterflies , and have a lot of fun doing all this . As much as this might sound terrible to some gamers , it 's actually not repetitive and boring , but in reality a lot of fun . The biggest flaw of the entire game is the camera . The camera is a bit difficult to handle , and will unfortunately cause a few cheap deaths . Also , this game in some ways feels a bit too easy because within a twenty minute period I located 14 dragons . Plus this game simply is n't as fun as it 's sequels Ripto 's Revenge or Year of the Dragon . But this game is too much fun to really complain about , and I can guarantee no matter what demographic of gaming you fall in you will have a lot of fun on Spyro 's PSone adventures .	1
A wonderful game , and I believe that it is a lot better than the second . In the second the graphics are solid , but the bad guys are n't the greatest bad guys and plus the levels look alike . Anyways , in this game you 'll jump off prehistoric glaciers , face giant enemies , glide across cliffs and free enslaved Dragons , and collect gems and treasure . Sure , some parts of this game is a little frustrating , and sure , the camera angles are a bit awkward , but you get used to it and get the hang of it . It 's a lot like RP games , where the first time you play it , it is incredibly hard , but once you beat it , you 'll play it hundreds of times . I must have beat this game atleast thirty times . Probably forty . Anyways , buy it . It 's worth your money . The graphics are fluid and spectacular , and at times this game can have some humor in it . It 's worth the money , believe me .	1
Great fun game I still enjoyed playing 10 years later . I got it at a great price too . Definitely buy this .	1
Spyro the Dragon : the game that SHOULD have been Sony 's mascot instead of Crash Bandicoot.The original Spyro the Dragon is probably the best platform/adventure game you can find for the Playstation . I ca n't give Spyro 's first adventure a 5-star rating , though . Let 's get the problems out of the way before moving on to the positive things about Spyro ( and believe me , there 's a LOT of good things about this game ) .People have compared Spyro the Dragon to everything from Crash Bandicoot to Banjo-Kazooie to Nights , and ... who knows what else . Well , I think the first Spyro game is JUST as good as all those games . In fact , Spyro the Dragon is better than the first Crash Bandicoot game . Now THERE 'S a game that disappointed me . Spyro came out of nowhere and RULED right from the beginning . I never would have guessed back in 1998 that Spyro would have went on to become a classic.Spyro 's debut does have a few problems , though . Seeing as how this is Spyro 's very first adventure I wo n't be TOO harsh . Am I the only one who thinks the play control could have been better ? It 's not that I have a tough time controlling Spyro . Well , to be honest , I DID have trouble controlling him at first . Spyro does n't QUITE take off when you hit up , down , left or right on the directional pad . There 's a split second delay before moving forward . Maybe the creators of the game thought this was part of the realism since , after all , you 're moving a DRAGON . A BIG creature like a dragon wo n't move forward right away . Then again , Spyro is small compared to the dragons you have to rescue.Controlling Spyro was definitely a problem for me at first . For example , attempting to properly jump on top of the three round platforms you encounter at the very beginning of the first world was NOT an easy task . I kept sliding off . By the way , I recommend you take advantage of these round platforms to get to know the controller . Master the controller before exploring the world . This will cut down on any possible frustration you may encounter in the future.I have to consider that my inability to control Spyro may have been due to the camera angles . Even though the camera in this game is *drastically* better than many other games , you have to admit it is n't flawless either . If you hit Pause and go to the options , you will see an option for a second camera view called `` active '' . This view is better because the camera immediately follows behind Spyro at ALL times . The other ( default ) camera view is more of a hassle trying to figure out where you 're moving , and you ca n't get a good view of what lies ahead . You may want to change it to `` active '' if the other camera view is difficult for you . Thank goodness for this option ! Some people have a problem with the lack of challenge . While it 's completely true you wo n't have much trouble making it to the end of any stage in the game , prepare to die 4 or 5 times in each stage before you understand exactly what you have to do , and where you have to jump . I think the most challenging thing about Spyro the Dragon are the times you have to jump onto a far-away platform , and many times you just BARELY make it . Many times you will fall to your death . Be patient , though . The game NEVER messes with you by throwing in any impossible jumps . Sometimes it 's about finding *just* the right spot to jump and glide , and if you 're off just a *little bit* you wo n't make it . The creators of Spyro are smart not to make the game frustrating , seeing as how it 's supposed to be a game for the entire family . Good work.The biggest challenge comes at the very end of the game when you face the main boss . He 's really easy to beat , however , GETTING to him is a whole other story . You see , right at the very end before you face him , you have to jump over a series of disappearing platforms and if you fall ( and you WILL fall the first few times because it 's hard ) you will land in burning lava and have to do the whole stage over again . Not that the stage is really that long anyway , but this is by FAR the hardest part of the game . The other 99 % of the game only offers a slight challenge here and there.With that said , do n't be fooled into thinking the game will be a cakewalk because of all the easy obstacles found throughout World One . It DOES get harder . You see , many of the enemies you face in the later levels can only be defeated by either smacking them with your head , or shooting fire at them . You wo n't know which of these tricks will be most effective on them until you face the enemy and experiment . You also have to dodge fireballs , sword-swipes , dogs jumping at you , and tons of other enemy attacks WHILE you try to find the best way to defeat them . So it 's not pathetically easy after all.A minor complaint is that sometimes while you 're walking or running , the path will suddenly end , and you 'll fall to your death . Does n't happen often , but I thought it would be worth mentioning.I hate the way Spyro talks . He sounds like a bratty teenage rebel with a nasally voice . Not exactly what a dragons voice should sound like . Also , when you rescue the dragons , sometimes they say important things you might want to pay attention to . The problem here is that many times the important tips they say are n't really helpful because they say them right AFTER you 've already had to do them ! For instance , in one case after you glide to a far-away platform and rescue a dragon , the dragon will tell you how to glide . Obviously , since I needed to glide in order to rescue him , I already KNOW how to glide ! So I did n't NEED his help ! This happens a few times during the game . You just want to scream `` Thanks for nothing , bonehead ! `` The music was done by a member of the rock band the Police , Stewart Copeland . People may not realize it , but certain themes in Spyro the Dragon are *very* close to some of the songs that made the Police such a legendary rock band . Stewart Copeland may have intentionally created the music in this game to match that of the Police , specifically the songs `` walking on the moon '' and `` message in a bottle '' . You 'll soon realize that the same guy who created the music in this game also played a big part in creating those Police songs . The music in Spyro the Dragon is also very catchy and appropriate for the level you 're in . No complaints . The music is fantastic.I think the creators made a mistake . When you hit L2 the camera rotates clockwise , and R2 makes the camera rotate counter-clockwise . It should be the other way around . Another thing that needs reversed : the way Spyro flies in the bonus stages . When you press up , you fly down . When you press down , you fly up ! Strange mistake . This makes it harder to complete the flying stages , however , you do n't have to finish them.In fact , despite what people may tell you , you do *not* have to collect ALL the gems and ALL the dragons . Finding and collecting all the gems and dragons will only give you a better percentage and open up a bonus stage at the end of the game . The gameplay in Spyro the Dragon can actually be compared to Yoshi 's Island- you do n't have to find everything , but doing so will open up rewards and give you an overall better score . The creators did a fantastic job hiding gems and dragons , increasing the challenge . More often than not you will see a treasure chest or a dragon statue up high on a platform and not have a single clue how to reach it . It 's fun to run around and think about how to reach it . Some of them are cleverly located . One word to describe it- *awesome*Anyway , Spyro the Dragon is tons of fun and may possibly remind you of a 3D Donkey Kong Country , what with TNT barrels and the jungle levels you encounter later on . Spyro is much better than that overrated Crash Bandicoot game , and you should pick up Spyro the Dragon today .	1
For those who do n't know this is the very first Spyro game . This is such an awesome game.Pros1 . The Graphics-Given it is for the PS1 they are a little outdated , but looking back they are comical.2 . The Story-The game is engaging and keeps you playing all the time3 . The Dialogue-Absolutely funny and genius since [ Spoiler Alert ! ] the reason Gnasty Gnorc ( the main villain ) freezes the dragons is because the dragons call him ugly.4 . There are mini-games you can go back to after beating the game.Cons1 . I ca n't think of any	1
The is the first Spyro game and it paved the road for all the other Spyro games . The story : When the evil Nasty Norc turns all of the dragons into statues , it 's up to Spyro , a small purple dragon , to set them free and defeat Nasty Norc . You travel with Sparx , your dragonfly companion and also your health gage , as you collect gems and go through six gigantic worlds with over 25 levels in all . This game is great , although it 's not very challenging , it offers hour of entertainment . My favorite world is the Beast Makers world . It 's a creepy place and almost all the levels in it take place at nighttime , which to me is the best type of level in Spyro . My favorite is Tree Tops because it is a gigantic level that gives you that creepy feeling , even the music is creepy in it 's own way . Another minor flaw in this game is that it has no mini-games in it . Those always provide extracurricular fun , but I 'm happy to say that they are introduced in a later Spyro release . I 'd recommend this game today if you do n't already have it . If you not into Spyro , this is the place to start at .	1
Ah , Spyro ! Released in 1998 for the PS1 , Spyro is the first entry of many . [ Although , only the first three were any good , because the newer ones were owned by an poor company . ] Graphics : 9/10 : Horrible by today 's standards , but very good by 1998 standards . Colorful and clear old-school 3-D graphics.Music:10/10 : Pretty catchy , nothing really grinds on your ears.Sound : 8/10 : Pretty good.Gameplay:9.5/10 : You control Spyro , the PO 'd dragon , through many worlds . There he must collect gems , rescue dragons , fight enimies , bosses , and other dangers , and also use his trademark flame and charge moves . This game is a bit easy , but it 's very entartaining.The game costs about 10 $ about now , so buy it !	1
I have recently come across this wonderful little game that is just absolutely perfect for darklings , seemingly tailor-made.First of all , the flow of the 3D graphics are quite realistic . The character is an adorable baby dragon , with all the mannerisms of what a baby dragon might be , as if the creators modeled him from puppies & kittens , which is probably what they did.So little Spyro is set to explore in his homeland , where he derives sustainance from sheep , & questing for gems & treasures , perusing into archways & temples , & fending off sheepherders armed with staves . The Satanic implications are obvious . A dragon insinerating sheep for food ... ? Sheepherders protecting their sheep ? Predator vs . prey ... In certain situations , such as when killing a charging ram , smashing into walls , giants attacking , you will note the joystick vibrate , thereby making the gaming experience a bit more tactile.So the player is Spyro the Dragon , helped along with the advice of ancestors . It is remarkable how noble these mentors are , their voices echoing their arcane wisdom unto their young.In travelling , we also embark into Stone Creek , & the more aesthetically-pleasing Dark Hollow , where new creatures wander to be defeated , & more treasures to be plundered . Bit by bit , little Spyro learns to glide , then eventually fly.Gaming tip : Avoid water !	1
I 've been addicted to Spyro since I was a little kid , and this is the original game that got me hooked . I 'm terrible at video games , but I love to play this ... I 'm sure experienced gamers could beat this kind of game with their eyes closed , but for me it 's quite the challenge , and I enjoy it !	1
I 'll recommend Spyro to anyone , fun enemies and worlds , and awesome concepts . Graphics are n't the best of course , but the gameplay is so addicting , collecting gems and freeing your fellow dragons . Must-have for a Playstation 1 collection .	1
Okay I first played this back when it first came out and back when the graphics were good . Now , it is almost 11 years later and I still absolutely love this game although its graphics are old-school compared to say the Wii 's graphics or PS3 's . But this game was good . It was not easy for me but with a little practice I got better . There is only one egg that still is a challenge for me to get and I do n't remember the name of the sub-world it is in but it 's the one with a whole bunch of trees . I always forget where to turn/jump to get the height and speed I need to reach the egg . But big deal , this game is how I remember Spyro and brings back fond memories.One reviewer had a good point when he said the dragons you release from the stone do give you some pretty redundant advice such as telling you how to glide after you just finished gliding to reach the little booger ! But you can interrupt them which I always do so no biggie . The mini-games are fun and even though you do n't have to complete them to finish the game there is a part of me that always has to complete the game 100 % . I will hunt down every gem , every egg and every pink egg from those annoying blue things you chase.This is n't the best Spyro game but it is among the top three . The other two are the two that followed this one . Insomniac knew how to make these games and I wish they 'd make any others that come out because frankly , Universal , Vivendi , etc . ruined this series for me .	1
Graphics : 10/10 - All the Spyro games have amazing graphics and this one is no exception . Fabulous , beautiful , eye-catching ! Check ` em out ! Sound : 7/10 - Spyro 's usual flapping wings , splashing water , swishing buck sound and great editing satisfy , even if the overall sound could 've improved.Value : 7/10 - Fun to play at the time but you wo n't go back to Spyro to go and play it again and again too many times . But it looks great and is still entertaining so it 's worth the money.Overall : 9/10 - This blew me away with its creativity and amazing graphics . The ultimate original 3D platform game ! If you liked this I recommend the Crash Bandicoot games and the sequels to Spyro the Dragon which are even better than this tasty candy .	1
I love this game . The characters are cute , they make great noises , and there are lots of worlds to explore . It 's really hard to die too , so you could concievably play without a memory card . What I do n't like about it is that Spyro is a little hard to control compared to today 's games , and a lot of parts are highly frustrating . Thieves have stolen a bunch of dragon eggs and you have to chase them down and get the eggs back , but this is MUCH easier said than done . I have spent hours chasing these guys on some levels . I mean , I would n't want the game to be too easy , but this is borderline ridiculous . But it 's still a really great game and I absolutely fell in love with it . I 'd recomend it to people who love cute things and have infinite patience .	1
The original Playstation Spyro the Dragon trilogy is the best game series out there , especially for younger gamers , and people that just like to play easy games to pass time ( like me ) . This game started it all with Spyro , and its still one of the best video games ever made in my opinion . If you have never played a video game , or just want a little something different to play , this is a nice and easy one for you .	1
This game is a really good game . There is a good storyline to it and challenging . But is n't Spyro 's best . It 's a good game in the end .	1
The game for its time was good both for its gameplay and its graphics . The game was one of the first demo games I played and it was tough , but later on I got the hang of it and passed it . It took me some time but in the end , it was well worth it .	1
One of the first games I ever played on the ps1 . Spyro is a classic and still fun to play today on my ps2 slim . Great for all ages to play a fun easying going relaxing game . You play as spyro a young dragon that has to rescue all the other dragons from nasty nork to defeat him , but along the way spyro is traveling through different worlds , collecting items and treasures . Make sure you have a ps1 memory card to save your progress if your using a ps2 system .	1
Had to get this game beings my mama 's sister bought me one but the disc was messed up in certain parts of the game . I enjoyed it very much , and the challenge behind it was unlike any other game i played . Thanks .	1
The original Spyro is an incredibly fun game . Although not nearly as refined as Year of the Dragon , or Ripto 's Rage , the classic Spyro is still hours of fantastic entertainment .	1
I got a great deal on this used PS1 game . My girlfriend plays this classic game and enjoys it a lot . She 's not much of a gamer . The disc seems to be in great condition with no scratches and plays perfectly . There 's a few tiny & # 34 ; cracks & # 34 ; within the inner ring of the disc , but this is common and DOES NOT affect the actual disc itself . It seems like an alright game to me , just not my style , which is why I gave it a 4/5 . But a lot of people seem to like this game . It 's a great kids game as well .	1
Not boring , not geat either . I like how they have designed it and how good the graphics are but this is n't the best out of the three . I prefered the 2 nd most but really enjoyed the 3 rd too . If you are looking for a lot of adventure , try out this . BRILL .	1
Fun game ! Never played a dragon with an attitude of kick butt until I found Spyro .	1
That said , the game is really fun . Not too hard that you rent it and after a while throw the controller down in frusteration-not too easy that you breeze through it . No , there are gems to collect and characters to meet . This was the beginning of Spyro . He only got better and better in future games . Check this one out first though or it 'll drive you crazy ( everything improves SO much in the next game ) Did I mention how CUTE Spyro is ? ?	1
I used to play this game as a kid , but my copy got ruined and i 've wanted a new one ever since . I bought this one and could not be more pleased with it . works great , and a nice reminder of some of the fun I had when i was younger .	1
Name me one child of the nineties who did n't grow up playing this game , and I will show you an unhappy adult . Spyro was a very important part of my childhood happiness , and remains a part of my life to this day . In a time where all the other young girls around me were playing with kitchen sets and drawing on the sidewalk with chalk , I was kicking Gnorc butt.As I 'm sure there are some people out there who are still unfamiliar with everyone 's favorite purple dragon , how about a quick rundown ? The Dragon Realms are a peaceful place , full of artists and dreamers and crafters , and they pride themselves on their beautiful gems . While some dragons are being interviewed about their world , the long banished Gnasty Gnorc overhears some less than positive comments about himself . In retaliation , he turns all of the dragon 's beautiful gems ( which reflect his face back at him ) into Gnorc minions , and freezes the dragons in crystal prisons . All , that is , except one short little purple firebreather , who becomes the hero by taking it upon himself to defeat the Gnorcs and free all the dragons.You utilize two attacks ; your flame breath , and your horn charge . Throughout the levels you encounter several types of enemies , but especially Gnorcs . Your goal throughout the game is to unfreeze all the dragons , and collect stolen dragon eggs from the taunting blue thieves . Each of the six homeworlds contains a non-mandatory boss battle ( aside from the Gnorc Gnexus ) and a balloonist who will transport you to the next homeworld . Your health meter is represented by a little dragonfly by the name of Sparx that follows you around . Sparx starts out bright yellow , dulls to blue , then to green , and once he is gone , you 're toast . Lives are gained with small dragon statues , or collecting so many of a small silver orb dropped by previously defeated enemies.Spyro is a classic that will never die , and your life will only be made better by playing it !	1
Whatever happened to the days when games were made to be fun ? Whatever happened to the days where replay value was through the roof and graphics were not as heavily emphasized ? This game is well over 10 years old now and it is still fun to play . Even in this day and age I see kids enjoying it . This should be one of those games that developers look back upon and say what made that game so much fun ? What can we learn from this aside from improving upon the old school 3D graphics ? Spyro may not be the best game of all time but it certainly is a fun one for me that I have had a lot of fond memories playing .	1
Spyro is a cute little dragon with a huge boost of cool powers . It is an incredibly fun game action game that is great for kids or adults .	1
I played the original Spyro trilogy extensively multiple times in my childhood , having attained a 100 % completion status on the first 4 Spyro games released . I am no stranger to the series or this game in particular obviously . I bought this game almost only because of the nostalgic value it has to me . As well as the fact that I 'm attempting to amass a collection of all game console systems and the best of their games , according to my own opinions.But on to the game itself . As the subject title implies , ( for me ) it is and always will be , a timeless classic in the history of videogames , as it is almost the first real game I ever played and actually tried and succeeded in completing . For the time , it 's graphics were close to cutting edge , and the story is simple , yet actually completing everything 100 % , is quite a difficult task depending on what part you 're trying to do so on . The gameplay mechanics are a little stiff , but no more than expected from a game released in 1998 on a system that has been rebooted 4 times since the one this game was developed for . If you care at all about great games , or if you played this in your childhood , you 're going to want this for your collection .	1
i have all the PS1 spyro games , and i love them the newer games not so much . This is one of my favorite PS1 series of games , and i 'd recommend all of these games to anyone in a heartbeat . This is a family friendly title , and a good game to own . Some of the game was a little challenging for me at first . i remember the ads , and wanting to have this game and the un-wasted excitement when i finally held the case in my hands.Spyro is the main character ( obviously ) a little purple dragon with Sparx ( a dragonfly and his best friend ) following him around , Sparx represents Spyro 's health and proctects Spyro . He can only take so many hits or damage spyro should of recieved before Spyro is on his own and can only get hit once , to avoid this however you can ram or flame the sheep ( called fodder ) and they will turn into butterflies which Sparx eats in one bite for a life . The mission of the game is to free your fellow dragons who were all turned to crystal statues ( Spyro was n't tall enough to get hit by the spell ) , get the eggs and dragon treasure back , and beat Gnasty Gnorc who hates dragons and besides turning them into statues stole all the dragon treasure and the dragon eggs .	1
This game is so , so , so good ! You can play it for hours and not get bored ! If you are lonely or bored , get Spyro now , now now ! It is so great , you 'll adore it !	1
Do not be fooled by the fact that dragons are more suited to little kids and that the game appears like a cartoon . This is a very fun game in which an evil creature called Gnasty Gnorc scatters gems all over the dragon world , turns some into his minions , lets blue thieves into the dragon world to steal their precious dragon eggs , and encases all the dragons in crystal . He missed Spyro , so it 's his job to turn the dragon world the way it was . The graphics are colorful and the sound and music are also nice , and as for replay value , it has a fairly good amount . If there is one thing to complain about , it is the difficulty level . The enemies do n't put up too much of a threat , and finding gems and dragons is usually fairly easy , and even the bosses are pretty easy to toast . But it can prove quite a challenge to some people , and may include some testing with some things . But besides these two facts , Spyro the Dragon is a nice , colorful game that is well worth the money .	1
I own all the Spyro games that Play Station has ever made . I would have to say that this game has advanges and disadvanges . Some good things about it is that this is the only Spyro game where you free the dragons . In the rest of the games , you help other people ... It is funny and very interesting . ( Sorry , but I wo n't give the funny parts away . ) The disadvanges is that you ca n't swim . In the other to games you can but in this game , if you touch the water you will die ! ! Another bad thing is that they do n't have the cute characters like the other two games . I would buy Spyro 3 first and then buy Spyro 1 . I think Spyro 3 has more stuff to do and has a better story line . I even think Spyro has a better voice . If you like all three Spyro 's , try buying the Spyro pack . It is much cheaper than buying all of the games seperatly . Then you can decide which one is better ! !	1
This game is a very fun game . Very well made . You play Spyro ( DUH ) , a young dragon . All the other dragons ( I think there are 60 or so of them ) , have been captured and turned to stone , and are scattered about in the different worlds . The Dragon Eggs have been stolen by theives who are running around and hiding in different worlds . The dragon 's treasure is lying around everywhere ( not to mention alot of it has been turned into enemies ) . And who is the cause of this ? GNASTY GNORC . And now , as Spyro , you must save the dragons , find the eggs , collect the treasure and defeat Gnasty Gnorc . Ok , that 's the plot basicall ; now here is what the game is like : As Spyro , your mission is to ( As I said before ) save the dragons , find the tresure and rescue the eggs . Being a young dragon , your wings are not fully grown , so you can not fly . You can , however , glide over short distances . You also have the ability to ( Of course ) breathe fire and charge with your horns . There are several worlds throughout the game . Each of these worlds has one home level , and in each of the home levels , there are doorway/portholes through which lie other levels for the worlds . In each of the worlds there will be dragons , treasure and eggs.Dragons : These have been turned to stone by Gnasty Gnorc . To save them you simply find them , then walk up to them or charge at them or Flame them . They will then come back to life and talk to you before flying away . Some will give you advice , others will thank you , and some will just talk ( sometimes insulting you ) .Treasure : Treusure is just lying around in different places . Most of the enemies turn into treasure ( which looks like gem stones ) . Some treasure are in chests . Most chests can be rammed or flamed to open them , but some requre dynamite or fire works or other ways to open them.Eggs : These are held by theives . To get them , you must chase after the theif and ram or flame him.Enemies : There is a large variety of enemies ( most enemies are really treasure that have been turned into minions for Gnasty Gnorc ) . Most can be killed by ramming or flaming , though some are armored and can only be hurt by flaming and not by ramming or visa versa . Some boss enemies , however , require special battle tactics.There are also fairies who will help you in some way . Some will catch you if your falling , and will move you to safety , while others will give you a Super Strong fire breath ( which will allow you to flame armored enemies ) . Hovering above Spyro is a dragonfly . The color of the dragon fly shows you your current health . Green , if your have full health , and red if you are very hurt . He will disappear if you get hurt when he is red . In each home world there are guys with hot air ballons . These ballooners tell you what you must do in that world for them to take you to the next world ( you can always return to past worlds later to pck up anything you might have missed ) . In most worlds you usually have to find a certain number of dragons , treasure or eggs . Finally , you will get to Gnasty 's world , where you will have to fight Gnasty Gnorc.Well , that 's & quot ; Spyro the Dragon & quot ; . I recommend this game to anyone who has Playstation . It 's not a waste of money , I assure you .	1
I know this is an old game , but this is definitely a classic to have . When eventually I have have kids , or when my nieces and nephews grow a little older , I 'll introduce them to these classic games . This is one of the best PS1 games out there .	1
Awww , good times ! I first bought this game when it first came out , when I was around eight-years-old . I played it non-stop , battleing against the Gnorcs , aquiring treaure , ramming through thouse nasty blue thieves for the pink-spotted eggs , getting more life for poor Spyro , and resqueing the dragons locked in stone , of course.Now , I 'm playing more mature games . Resident Evil 4 is one of my favorite games for the Gamecube counsel . Along with The Legend of Zelda : Ocarine of Time/Twilight Princess , and Hitman 2 . But after playing thouse games on the sparkling Gamecube counsel , I turned my gaze to the dusty , gray Playstation , and out popped Spyro again ! I 'm actually replaying the game , I already beaten both of the two first worlds in under an hour . But it is a really good experience to play this old jewel again ! I also own four other Spyro games : Spyro : Ripto 's Rage , The Year of the Dragon ( Both of thouse for my old Playstation and are VERY fun ! ) along with the alright , but not the same : Hero 's Tale , and the crappy game some idiot thought up : The Legend of Spyro : A New Beggining . I despised thouse two games for what they had done to that cool , little dragon we use to know.But , alas ! At least I saved my original game for times like these ! Please , if you still have your old gray Playstation , ( or a Playstation 2 ) than fish out Spyro from the attic or the closet and replay it ! Or , if you are new to the first original Spyro games , go out and buy them ! ( that is , if you do n't mind an extreamly easy game ) The game is fun , nevetheless it being easy , it holds that sparkling air that Ocarina of Time and Super Mario 64 holds ! [ Sparks , The Dragonfly ] Gold = Full HealthBlue = Medium HealthGreen = Low HealthNo Sparks = One More Hit Left-To correct anyone that got Sparks color coded health wrong . ^-^ [ Spyro , The Dragon ] Able to glide short-distancesCan run/ram with his hornsCan jumpCan buckAnd can do the roll to avoid enemy attack ( Why did n't they remake that move for all the other games , I ask ? ) And of course , flame enemies !	1
Spyro the Dragon was the game I got right after it 's sequel : Spyro 2 Ripto 's Rage . I know it 's a bit too late , but I just think that the Spyro series are too fun . Spyro 2 is better than the first , but this game is still great . The graphics and sound is nice , the gameplay will leave you hours into this game , and the story is original . Spyro is one of my favorite series , and this game is great and fun for everyone .	1
Well , with a million reviews already , this makes it even easier for me . One of the original and best action/adventure games for the PS , you ca n't go wrong with Spyro ( and the proceeding sequels ) . Owned the game a while back but my nephew somehow lost it . I completed it fully , an I 'm about to play through it again , even though it 's been like 8 years . Never got the sequels but I 'm getting them from here now . Got 5 more PlayStation classics to go , including Spyro 2 and 3 .	1
Game most played by my granddaughter . She loves the game . It is fun to watch as well . Good game for kids .	1
Like everyone says , the first three Spyro games on the PS1 were great classics and all the others suck . Yes , PS2 , GameCube , Xbox , Xbox 360 , Wii , PS3 , and Wii U all have bad Spyro Games . The only good Spyro games are on PS1 and maybe GBA . And I 'm not just making this up I actually bought a used PS1 to play the original Spyro and I 've played Legend of Spyro on my GameCube . And even though I really like the GameCube , I hated Legend of Spyro . On top of that , the most modern systems have even worse Spyro games .	1
This games is one of those few titles where stealth killing is actualy fun . Tenchu had competant graphics for the time , though ugly by 2012 standards . The controls definately had issues but lets face it , this is the best Tenchu game to date . Tenchu has not alway done well as a franchise but this has its charming moments . Years later , the thing that sticks out most to me is the Soundtrack . There are certain games you hang onto for the BGM 's . This is one of those games . The over the top stealth kill and trying to unlock certain items is well and good but the music is the thing that always calls me back . This games wonky graphics and play controls were never anything to write home about and only got worse with each consequential sequal and retread . The first one is the best in the series , in my opinion . Priority was never graphics or packaging . It was all about the fun.. and lovely soundtrack .	1
... I found another ninja game called `` Tenchu : Stealth Assassin '' . I read the back of it and it looked pretty good . When I tried it back at home , I was blown away ! This game was really sweet . And after I tried the demo of `` Ninja : Shadow of Darkness '' that was in my game `` Fighting Force '' , I realized I was lucky that I did n't waste my money on it.I would never trade this game in for that other stupid one . This game is incredible . Going up to guys from behind and killing them with classic stealth kills like the throat slit and the stab from up front . Not only that , but the enemies that you fight in the game are awesome : samurai , ninjas , bears , wolves , dogs , and all kinds of demons . This game is totally awesome , if a bit slow though . It the jumping and fighting action were more like it was in `` Devil May Cry '' , it would have been just like playing in a Japanese anime . Oh well , it was still a good game . If you 're a true ninja fan , you must have this game ... you wo n't regret it .	1
Unlike the Corny ninja titles of years past like & quot ; Ninja Gaiden , & quot ; & quot ; Ninja , & quot ; and others of that manner . Tenchu finally takes the Ninja game to the next level . Not just a run around and throw stars at senseless , weak enemies , this game forces you to learn and master stealth and the art of sneak attack . The different weapons available keep the onslaught more versatile , and the different sword attacks seem to stun the viewer with there harsh and brutal images . A great game , a great story line , but still a few small problems . even though you have a large variety of weapons they are very limited . some of the game may be confusing , and not very straight forward as to what you are supposed to do , and you tend to run into some very annoying camera views that seem to definately take away from the game play . But overall it 's a very entertaining game which i recommend to any action fan .	1
I am a latecomer to Tenchu . Since it is a PS1 game its graphics really show the PS1 's age against the PS2 . However if you are willing to accept/ignore that difference you will find Tenchu a very satisfying and deeply fun game . This is most definitely one of PS1 's best games.The game becomes more enjoyable the better you are able to master your ninjitsu skills . The controls are difficult to master at first , but stick with it and you will eventually be rewarded . I used to just jump off a roof and try and hack at my enemy . Now I can do a reverse back flip off a roof behind an enemy and exact a perfect kill . Far too cool.Pros : - Many many ways to finish a level.- Stealth is heart throbbingly fun.- Plentiful cheats for amateurs.- Wonderful soundtrack . I ended up buying a copy of the soundtrack too.- Variety of ninjitsu moves makes killing stylishly fun.Cons : - Since it is a stealth game you have to be very patient to make sure no one can see you before you go for the kill . This can take a long time.- Each level is long and the boss is at the end of the level . Dying in the boss ' hands means you have to start the whole level from the beginning- No saves during a level.- Joypad controls are difficult to master- but are necessary to support all the ninjitsu moves .	1
This game offers unique play . It has a pretty good storyline that keeps your attention , but the stealth required to play the game makes it a keeper . Unlike Metal Gear , you actually loose points by being spotted , even if you make it through the mission successfully . You can opt to go through the mission again for a higher score , or you can go on to the next mission . I liked that aspect the most because the second time around ( knowing where everyone is hiding and waiting for you ) you get to get the drop on them ! Cool beans .	1
I have been searching for this game far and wide and now I have finally acquired it . It 's a pretty awesome game with a lot of action and you must use a lot of stealth .	1
I actually did purchase this game two times . I lent it out some years ago and never got it back . I recently noticed that the price is very modest so I picked it up again . Why ? This game is an older generation game ( PS1 ) , but it is better than some PS2 games I have played that only advertise graphics but have poor gameplay or short game time . Tenchu is a satisfying game that lets you creep around , slice necks from behind , and hide out on rooftops . You will avenge the death of a crooked merchant , rescue a captive nijna , save a princess , destroy a fiendish cult , stop the spanish pirates , and fight a big boss with a bigger sword . Of course there are those who opppose this type of activity and thus will try to stop you . Its lots of fun running around , hiding , killing from the unseen . Its better while doing it while the great game soundtrack is playing . This game has very catchy music that brings you you right in . The graphics , like I said , are mediocre , but that wont make or break a game anyway . Gameplay makes the game and this game has plently . Plenty of enemies to defeat , two selectable characters , a bunch of ninja items to utilize , and the percect amount of levels.What isnt so good about the game ? Each ninja only has a small amount of stealth kills to use . There are plenty of regular attacks to be diverse but only 3 stealthy kills . One kill is rarely used due to the fact that you have to be iun front of you r enemy to use it which is dangerous because he will see you . You usually do the neck slice ( yawn ) . Another downside is that many of the ninja items you acuire will be useless . Since you can only carry 4 , you will take ninja stars , bombs , paralyzing rice cakes , and the grapling hook . The others are junk or rare objects recieved as bonuses for completing the missions on a master ninja score . Again the graphics are dated . The enemy AI is a pretty stupid . You can run past an ememy warrior and duck behind a bush or tree and he wont know where you went . He will look around himself quick and resume his patrols , `` Where are you ! ? `` Its still a load of fun and can be a challenge at first to get a perfect rating and unlock secret items . Replay value is pretty darn good . You might get tired of it after beating it with both ninjas , but you will get a taste for it some time later . This game will not sit in a closet . Many PS2 games sit in my closet , but this dated PS1 game is in my PS2 right now .	1
Got this game today . I remember playing this game when I was younger . I was a better ninja back then . : D I am a little rusty , and horrible at stealth now , compared to when I was younger . I miss this game so much , I bought it . Thanks , for sending it in earlier than expected ! : D	1
This is a great stealth game and one of the first I ever played ( besides Metal Gear Solid ) . I spent many hours on this just being sneaky . The main thing I liked about this is that it 's not your typical run around hack and slash game . You actually had to think about what you 're doing and what the outcome would be . The voice acting was n't that great but it was at the time when this came out . I think most people 's problem with this game ( myself included ) was the annoying camera angle at time but once you got used to it , it was n't that bad . Definately a classic game in my book .	1
I was brought into the Tenchu series with Wrath of Heaven ( not a great place to start ... ) , but after renting and eventualy buying the third Tenchu instalment , I made it a point to track down the originals . I 'm writing this review in 2005 , a time of Metal Gear Solids , online Splinter Cells , and innovative Hitman games . Yet this title , released in 1998 , still impresses , and is well worth effort of tracking it down and buying . Some things a buyer needs to heed however is the lack of analog control . For gamers raised on analog controllers , this game may be a little hard to manage at first . Also , the game , which emphisises stealth and patience is not without a frustrating moment or two , as the camera can be troublesome in places , and there is no in game save feature ( try spending 2 hours working to get a good rank on a level , only to be killed by the level 's extremely difficult boss , and be sent back to the begining ... ) . All together , the game features an impressive aray of Ninja weapons and items , decient replay value , two playable characters and a good story that sets the stage for several sequels . While it may feel simplistic to gamers hardened on newer stealth titles , and the graphics may not feel as polished , Stealth Assassins is a difficult chalenge and rewarding experience for anyone willing to overlook some simple flaws , and who possesses a good deal of patience . I highly recomend it .	1
This game rules , this game is a classic and it rules . 10 out of 10 one of my favorites . But this is all nostalgic opinion , still 10/10	1
Resident Evil 2 . I realized I had n't written a review for my favorite game of all time . Yes , I 'm not kidding . This game has it all . Graphics , check . ( Still look good today in 2009 . ) Gameplay , check . Music , check . Gore and zombies , check and check . It just does n't get any better than this . I loved the original but when I got this game is when I got really hooked into the series.The game is filled with great atmosphere . There 's no game that defines survival horror better than this one . This was Capcom at the height of their powers . Silent Hill is a close second in the genre . Resident Evil 2 improved upon the original in many ways . The voice is a little better though it still has moments of cheese . The weapons look better and are upgradeable , the game has two scenarios where your choices make slight differences in the other character 's game.Yes this game is survival horror royalty . Get it , I do n't care what system you get it for , but just get it .	1
In my opinion this is the best Resident Evil yet , although I have still not played Code Veronica . If you 're going to buy a Playstation Resident Evil title get this one . It is by far the longest one also .	1
One of the best survival horror games of all time . If ya do n't know , now ya know ...	1
we have every resident evil game we love the game and we love that the game was in great shape when we got it and how fast we got it	1
Turn the lights off and play RE 2 to the very end . For me RE2 was the best in series so far .	1
My first experience with the Resident Evil series was with Code : Veronica X. I was severely disappointed overall with it , and from what I 've read , the whole series is the same , so I had little to no faith in it . I did n't feel the need whatsoever to play the other games , and openly spoke out against the series , even though I only played one game . But , after playing Resident Evil 4 , I got intrigued by the story , so I decided to try out Resident Evil 1-3 . I thought , `` There 's no way they can be worse than Code : Veronica , so why not ? '' And good god ... was I right.Although the first RE was little more than a big laughable joke ( thanks to the ridiculously horrible voice acting that makes what you find in Code : Veronica X look like an Oscar-winning performance ) , that was n't really scary at all until the hunters came into the picture , the second iteration really blew me away . Anybody who has known me for more than two seconds knows I do n't care at all about graphics in a videogame , so I 'm not going to say anything about them because it is irrelevant ( which is why I 'm not a GameCube or Xbox fan ) . The gameplay is very good for a survival horror - there is plenty of puzzle solving , adventure , exploration , and combat to keep the interest level up . That 's what I like about survival horror : it 's not just about fighting to stay alive , but it is also about exploring and solving puzzles to unravel the plot and make sense out of mysterious circumstances . And , while Resident Evil 2 is n't anywhere near as scary or intricate in story as the Silent Hill series , it is still a top-notch game to play for any fan of the genre , and I highly recommend it . The first one you can play on your own ; I just played it because I wanted to know what Wesker did to get Chris so ticked off with him , and vice versa . The reason the title of my review is `` I was wrong ... '' is because I really was wrong in assuming that the Resident Evil series was a bunch of bunk and no worth anyone 's time . So , I apologize for being a presumptuous jerk.But , there is one issue I just ca n't stop from addressing : the controversy over the control scheme . Now , I wo n't go into one of my trademark rants insulting everybody , but I will state my thoughts from an objective point of view . The reason survival horror games have such awkward controls is because the game developers wanted it that way . This is a genre for puzzle solving , plotlines , exploration , and thought , not just about shooting things . They made the controls this way to render it , in a way , a sort of `` anti-action '' type of game genre . Still , though , once you get used to the controls , like me , you will have no trouble blasting zombies torsos in two soon enough.Another thing that is cool about this game is the zombies and their ... `` creative '' death sequences ( okay , so maybe they die a second time , but this time for good ) . Naturally , you can blow their heads off , but even more possibilities await your execution . Sometimes , you can fire at them and their arm will be severed by your bullets , or with a shotgun you can shoot them at the base of their spine and they will be blasted in half , the upper section of their body crawling on the ground with its arms alone to try and bite you . When you upgrade your shotgun later on , you can actually blow their chest in half ! And , with a rocket launcher , if you fire at them square in their torso , their arms , head , and a good portion of their upper body will be gone . If you hit them to the right side , most of said side will be gone , as will their head and respective arm , yet their left arm will still be attached . Pretty cool , huh ? Code : Veronica X did n't have anything like that , which is rather too bad.The only problem I had with this game , and it really is n't a problem with the game itself , is that it really made me shake my head at Code : Veronica X . It almost seems as if Capcom had taken a huge step backward in their videogame-making abilities . Heck , even the first Resident Evil is better than REC : VX . For example , in the first one , the hunters had narrow , sharp , reptilian eyes , rows of razor-sharp teeth that protruded from their mouths , and they looked pretty scary , but in Code : Veronica , they did n't have such teeth ( it almost looked like they did n't have any at all ) , and they also had small , beady eyes , making them more of a joke than an intimidating enemy.Yet another good part about this game is the Titan . I must say , he is really one heck of a bad guy . But , of course , he 's nowhere near as bad*ss as the Nemesis or as terrifying as Pyramid Head . But he 's cool nonetheless.So , in conclusion , if you like survival horror games , then I suggest you try this one out . But do n't expect it to be better than Silent Hill , if you 're a fan of that series ( just as a side note ) .	1
Now THIS is how you 're supposed to enjoy blowing through a bloody , violent game ! Blood squirting from moaning zombie bodies . It 's so strange and relaxing to experience this . I know you will laugh at what I am about to tell you , but I never bothered with this game when it first came out . Yeah , I know , I lost many friends because of this . I ignored this game in 1998 , and my level of coolness went right down the tubes . I had to fail math and pretend to smoke cigars to fit back in with my classmates again.Children should n't play this game . If you think it 's ok for children to see the two main characters in this game shoot and fry their way through the police station then you might not be a reasonable person . Yes that 's right : you can walk through a police station in this game . If in real life you have a problem with the way cops sit in a field and watch over you to make sure you have your seat belt on ( and not one of those cases where you pretend to put the seat belt on until the cop is out of view and then take it off again ) you now have a place to take out your frustrations- Resident Evil 2.The weapons in this game are realistically cool . I like pulling out the magnum and shooting zombies in the head and watching their heads blow to pieces . Do n't try this at home , but do try this on your Playstation . The magnum does n't make much noise so you would n't think it 'd be such a bad-ass weapon , but you can shoot at the head of a zombie and watch his head quietly blow to smithereens . You know you should n't do that in real life though , right ? You 'd go to jail for a very long time . And if you tried to explain to the police that you were shooting at zombies , you 'd only get laughed at by the entire court room . Use your head.If this game does n't satisfy your sick animal-like needs , then try looking for the fire blaster thing . You can cook zombies with this . It 's near the end of the game hidden in a locker . Go near the locker and press the X button , and it will open and you will say `` sweet '' .In this game you have two CD 's . One CD is for the Leon adventure , and the other CD is for the Claire adventure . You can choose to start the game with either Leon or Claire . To do the game completely you have to beat the game twice with Leon and twice with Claire . I 've only ever played this game on easy and I had a blast . I 'm sure on normal it 's quite harder , maybe so hard you ca n't think straight and become dumb . Of course you are n't dumb , it 's just that video games can confuse you sometimes.Man I 'm tired . But I 'm never too tired to take a couple hours from my easy-going day and blasting my way through this super cool game . The only downside is that you ca n't skip the cutscenes . That 's fine at first , when you want to listen closely to the story ( even though I did n't ) but after a while you really wish Capcom would have put a skip button on this thing.Still , great game . It 's old , but please do n't be one of those people who thinks that just because something is old it 's not good . I 've been around people who think like that and they just ai n't cool . Sure , these people get all the girls and all the friends , but what else ? What 's `` in '' sucks , and what 's old is cool . You think I 'm wrong ? Good for you . Buy this game used for 10 dollars today .	1
`` Resident Evil 2 '' , truly is a classic scare . Resident Evil 2 showcases just why the series became big , and why Resident Evil is the leader of the Survival-Horror genre by a landslide . `` Resident Evil 2 '' , was just full of new ideas . The 2 discs , and the 2 people to play as , where each of their actions affect the other person 's adventure , for example was just amazing.I 'm also not kidding when I call this game a `` scare '' . `` Resident Evil 2 '' will have you on the edge of your seat , and it may even have you wetting your trousers a bit at certain times . `` Resident Evil 2 '' is an essential pickup for any fan of the Survival-Horror genre . `` Resident Evil 2 '' did so much for the genre , that it shall be remembered forever .	1
RE2 was my first zombie game and ... ... I fell in love with this franchise right off the bat.I grew up on a steady diet of Sega Genesis games then I went to the N64 and my love of all things Mario.Then I finally broke down and got a PS2.RE2 was one of the first games I got for the system and it completely changed my outlook on games forever.I had never played such an adult oriented game . Not even Mortal Kombat came close to how `` R '' rated this game was.I was blown away.Incredible graphics for the time.Constants scares.Interesting puzzles that really did n't make any sense and still do n't LOL.Who cares , they were still a blast to solve anyway.A story line that rivaled the best Hollywood has ever thrown at us regarding the horror genre.I 'm not going to go into complaints now as the game is rather old.Did I have complaints at the time ? Only one ... ... .the characters control like a walking tank.All of this was corrected by RE4 but that 's about it for my complaints.One of the most influential games ever made.It brought adult gaming into the mainstream and proved that not all games have to have cute mascots . ( I still love my Mario and Sonic mind you . ) Excellence.Perfect in almost every way imaginable.A must play.Highest recommendations .	1
The game is now available for download via PSN for only $ 5.99 ! I spent 4 hours playing the game ; meaning I got my monies worth !	1
I 've been playing the series since I was about 10 , the first game I played was the remake of the first and resident evil . I also played the other series such as code veronica , Resident evil 5 , Resident evil revelations , Resident evil 3 nemesis , and Resident evil 6 . Feel free to get the game , its awesome but challenging at times . I highly recommend getting it . Also it can work on a ps2 but you need the original playstation memory card .	1
This game is one of the only games to truly terrify me . ( the other being silent hill . check my review on that in upcoming weeks ! ) The graphics are just right for this type of game , although they could have been better . The control is muddy , although never cumbersome . the weapons are alright , but upgrading them is a hoot . I wish that you could upgrade more weapons , though . An upgraded rocket launcher that could blow through doors , now that would be really ... ' cool ! ! ! Oh well , If I want to do that , I should go play Red Faction . The zombies are as dumb as oxes , but the lickers and dogs and the birds ( THEY ARE COMING TO GET ME ! ! ! ! ) are fairly intelligent . avoid those at all costs , if you know what is good fer ya . adios !	1
I played this before I played the original Resident Evil . I had just barely gotten the Playstation and was renting a bunch of stuff . Originally I hated this game because I could n't figure out how to play it . I had been a Nintendan with occasional defects to Sega ( I own a Genisis ) so I was unfamiliar with what has become a nearly standard control style for Playstation games . I did n't understand the pivoting , nor did I grasp the concept of holding R-1 to aim and X to shoot . I got frusterated and set it aside . However , my brother picked it up immediately after and managed to get me past the first screen . ( Yes I got killed right away . ) I watched my brother navigate his way through the game until he finally got killed by the first Licker . He begged me to buy it . So I did . After a while I decided to give it another try , and once I got used to the control style I beat it . I have played this this Resident Evil , and it many different incarnations across differnt platforms more than any other version . I have also bought this one the most times trying to get the `` ultimate edition '' and eventually got tired of it and bought the Dual Shock Greatest Hits version after the N64 version 's FMV sequences were so terrible . Although I will not buy the forthcomming GameCube port unless they imporove it as drastically as they did the original , I still recomend RE 2 as the most fun of the series . If for some reason there is someone out there who does not already have some version of this game do yourself a favor and pick one up . GameCube owners , I recomend waiting for the GCN version as it is supposed to have all of the various enhancements that all of the various versions of this game had , including the much desired analog control the N64 version featured .	1
Beat the first yet ? If you have , then jump right ahead to the second masterpiece in the series.It 's fun , it 's scary , and it is one hell of a ride . Ultimatley , Resident Evil 2 will give some nightmares . If the first one scared you , get ready to be terrified again !	1
lol	1
bryanreo @ sbcglobal.net And I say that Resident Evil 2 is perhaps one of the best resident evils for the PS1 . The sheer horror of the initial run to the police station is just the beginning . Then you must fight your way through the zombie infested maze . This game will have you jumping when you hear a noise outside . This is the game to get if you want to be scared for a few weeks after beating it . It took me about 5 hours I think it was , perhaps 6 hours . But I like to make sure all the zombies are dead . This game is a must if you are a fan of RE-1	1
The series of Resident Evil continues with its sequel Resident Evil 2 on PlayStation released in 1998 and developed by Capcom once again . It takes place in Raccoon City which is the closest residence of the mansion from the first game . This time , the entire city has been transformed into zombies from the outbreak of the T-virus created by Umbrella . You get to play as two characters : Leon S. Kennedy ( disc one ) who is a Raccoon City Police Officer on his first day of the job and Claire Redfield ( disc two ) who came into town to search for her missing brother Chris Redfield who was one of the main characters in the first Resident Evil game . Both characters get their own set of weapons and storylines , but it doesn & # 8217 ; t matter what order you play them in.The gameplay features the same basic principles as the first game . You have to solve puzzles , use a limited supply of ammunition , herbs to heal wounds , carry only eight items , and use typewriters to save . It & # 8217 ; s nice they stuck with the original format of the first game and I wish every Resident Evil game in the series was like this.You get some new weapons such as a bowgun , sub machine gun , spark gun and upgrades to Leon & # 8217 ; s handgun , shotgun and magnum . The aiming feels more comfortable and you always seem to be in control of where you shoot . One downside is that auto aim isn & # 8217 ; t set by default . When you start the game , you have to press & # 8216 ; Select & # 8217 ; to get to the options , select the controller settings and set the mode to & # 8216 ; Type C & # 8217 ; to turn the auto aim feature on . A nice new addition is that the character & # 8217 ; s current health can be determined by their posture and movement speed . This makes it easier to tell what condition your player is in and you don & # 8217 ; t have to go to the inventory screen to find out how much health you have like with the first game . The Item Boxes are back where you can store items you don & # 8217 ; t need and pick up later , but a new item you can retrieve is the & # 8216 ; Side Pack & # 8217 ; which will allow you to carry two more items increasing your total to ten . Both Leon and Claire are joined by a support partner throughout the story . Leon is aided by a woman named Ada Wong who is searching for her boyfriend . Claire is aided by a 12 year old girl named Sherry who was told to go to the police station because of the dangers in Raccoon City . But even the police station is infested with zombies and bio weapons . The enemies in this game are really memorable ; there are the lickers who are just terrifying and powerful , especially later in the game . Then there & # 8217 ; s Mr. X who is like the Terminator , he always comes back to hunt you down.The most innovative feature in this game is that there are different scenarios in this game . Say you play as Leon and complete the game as him ; well you can then play as Claire in that same scenario to find out the true ending . And you can & # 8217 ; t play Claire & # 8217 ; s second scenario by popping in the second disc for the first time to play as her , you have to unlock it first . So in total , there are four possible scenarios in this game.Another innovative feature is that you get a ranking based on the total amount of time it took to complete a scenario , the number of saves and healing items you use . If you do well , you can unlock some goodies such as infinite ammo for a sub machine gun , gatling gun , rocket launcher , unlock special outfits and three new mini games . The first mini game , you play as Hunk , whose mission is to escape the Raccoon City Police Department with the latest G-Virus created by Umbrella . The second mode is known as & # 8220 ; Extreme Battle & # 8221 ; in which you play through the entire map of the game and you have to locate four special bombs to destroy the T-Virus in Umbrella & # 8217 ; s Lab before it can cause a lot of damage . You get to play as four characters : Leon , Claire , Ada and Claire & # 8217 ; s brother Chris . Each has their own set of weapons and you can adjust a difficulty setting to fight stronger monsters including bosses from the regular game . The third and final game mode is called & # 8220 ; Tofu & # 8221 ; and it is the strangest mini game I have ever seen . You play as this giant block of Tofu ( Yes , I am dead serious , a giant piece of Tofu ) and in terms of the objective it & # 8217 ; s the same as Hunk & # 8217 ; s mission except you play as Tofu , who is only equipped with a combat knife , so it makes this mini game very difficult to complete . I & # 8217 ; ve completed the mode as Hunk , but never as Tofu . The good news however is that Tofu takes a lot of hits to kill so basically the only way to complete this game is to run . Don & # 8217 ; t even bother fighting the enemies , the knife in Resident Evil 2 is just extremely weak and isn & # 8217 ; t worth the time . Still this mode is worth playing just for the amusement factor because Tofu says some funny Japanese phrases whenever he gets hurt . It & # 8217 ; s funny , even though I can & # 8217 ; t understand it . It is also pretty difficult to unlock , you have to get an A ranking at least six times to play this mini game . For the Extreme Battle and Hunk , you only need two A rankings.One thing I didn & # 8217 ; t mention yet is that the music is really awesome . It has orchestral themes and even opera themes and it fits the game very well . There were many different versions of this game . There was an updated version on PlayStation called Resident Evil 2 : Dual Shock Edition which is the same as the regular game except it supports the PlayStation & # 8217 ; s DualShock controller & # 8217 ; s analog stick and vibration function . The Extreme Battle Mode I mentioned is exclusive only to the Dual Shock Edition . There & # 8217 ; s also a & # 8220 ; Rookie & # 8221 ; mode which gives the player a Machine Gun with infinite ammo at the start of the game , but you can & # 8217 ; t unlock the other mini games playing this difficulty even if you get an A ranking , you have to play Normal mode to unlock them . Another cool thing about the Dual Shock Version is you can use a cheat code to give yourself unlimited ammo . You just go to the control settings , hold R1 and press square repeatedly until the icon turns red . This version was later released on the PlayStation Store as a PS One Classic on the PlayStation 3.There were also ports on the PC and Dreamcast with slightly better graphics , higher frame rate and an art gallery . There was even a port on the Game com . It was a s***ty 2D black and white handheld console by Tiger . That port is just pathetic ; I & # 8217 ; m not even going to discuss it . The best port however is the Nintendo 64 version . The sound on the Nintendo 64 version is better than the PlayStation & # 8217 ; s version , it has updated graphics , new costumes , a setting to adjust the violence and blood color , a more responsive aiming control scheme , new files , cheat codes to give you infinite health and ammo and the most interesting feature of all is a randomizer to place items differently during each playthrough so it definitely has more variety . The only thing it & # 8217 ; s missing is the Extreme Battle mini game . But this port is equally as good as the PlayStation & # 8217 ; s version.Any criticisms I have with this game ? Well it & # 8217 ; s hard for me to think of things I don & # 8217 ; t like about this game , I guess a minor criticism is that you can & # 8217 ; t skip the in game cut scenes , you couldn & # 8217 ; t do that in the first game and it & # 8217 ; s a minor annoyance when you already played the game a million times like I did and just want to get through the game . The problem most people have with this game is the beginning . You start the game surrounded by about ten zombies with a slow handgun . The first time playing , you only have a few seconds to figure out the controls until the zombie & # 8217 ; s corner and kill you . It definitely sounds like a terrible idea to start next to the zombies . My strategy is to just run away . Hold square , press up on the d-pad to run and use up-left and up-right to get around the enemies . Once you figure that out , it isn & # 8217 ; t too hard to get past the zombies and give yourself some breathing room . It did take me a while to figure out the controls but I & # 8217 ; ve mastered it and you can too . The voice acting in this game is much better than the first Resident Evil , but still nothing too special . That & # 8217 ; s about all the criticisms I can think of.When I was a kid , I used to play the s*** out of this game and in my opinion ; this is undeniably not only the best Resident Evil game , but the best survival horror game and one of the best PlayStation games I have ever played . This game still manages to be very scary , if you & # 8217 ; re playing this for the first time , you are guaranteed to be so scared ; your heart will burst out your chest . Trust me ; I had my jumps even to this day . It & # 8217 ; s more fun playing this game alone in your room in the dark , with the volume turned up . This makes for a terrifying and memorable experience . I absolutely love this game , it & # 8217 ; s just a masterpiece . I & # 8217 ; d recommend getting the version from the PlayStation Store to play on the PS3 for only $ 6 , or the regular PlayStation version or the Nintendo 64 version . Those are the best options . The replay value is very high for me and I could play this game at any time . You will admire this game and it & # 8217 ; s by far the best in the entire series .	1
I love playing this game on my PS2 . I 'm not even going to get the gamecube version because it 's exactly the same as the good old PSone version . Very entertaining and mysterious .	1
My friends and I got this when it first came out so long ago in like 99 or something like that . Might have been earlier too . Anyways , I played it through myself on Leon first and the game had an amazing storyline and the RPG part of the game is amazing . There are a few challenging mini puzzles which can be very annoying , much like Zelda , but once you get past them all is well again . I would highly recommened this game to anyone , and compared to the gore they have in nowadays games , this is nothing .	1
I bought this game the day it came out , I was very impressed then and this game still impresses me today , Ilove the story and Leon is my favort charicter.Thats why I am looking foward to RE4 for Gamecube .	1
I see myself as a guru of Survival Horror games , I like'em and I like what they make me feel . Now let 's get on with my review for Resident Evil 2.I have to first mention that I did not and will not buy Resident Evil 2 or Resident Evil 3 for Gamecube ... unlike Resident Evil Remake they have nothing new to offer me or you ... which is sad after seeing what they did and what improvement remake was to the original Resident Evil . So let 's just keep this review centered around the Original Resident Evil 2 game for PSX 1.Comparing RE 2 to RE or RE Director 's Cut is like comparing Raw Horsemeat to a young Stallion . Resident Evil 2 had better graphics and sound by far , not to mention the fact that it was on a bigger bolder scale than Resident Evil . Simple bottom line folks is that if your looking for a GOOD Survival Horror game ... pick this one up.I had no real gripes towards the game and I felt that the DEVs of the game did everything in the better interest for the Resident Evil genre . As you can see by the score that I gave this game , I liked it and I truly think you 'd like it aswell .	1
I rented this game when it first game out , I was scared out of my mind . Everything made me jump , now I have sort of gotten over that , I am 15 and although the music and sound ( zombie moaning and feet stepping ) creates this scary atmosphere , it is not THAT scary . Most of you can handle it.Anyways , I needed a strategy guide for some of it . It just , it just is unrealistic . Yea to put out a fire you need a crank in a cabin ? Why was the crank removed in the first place . `` We need to make it so if there is a fire of some sort , this hose we have hooked up , will release some water . '' Yea they happened to put a handy dandy hose thingy in the ceiling , so just incase a helicopter crashed under it , or there was a mass fire under it , the hose would put it out . Yea right . Ok you need a cord just to close some shutters so zombies wo n't attack you ? If the police were fighting , they should of closed these shutters beforehand , so less zombies came in . Instead , they decided to put the cord in an office about a mile away . Wan na get into that room ? You need the crest and key and plugs buddy ! How did the police actually get around this police station.Moving off of that , the game is alright . You have alot of ammo on easy , although I fear I will run out alot of the time , I usually find a pack or 2 to keep me going . The zombies themselves can take quite alot , like 5 hits to kill them . However once you get the pistol modification for Leon , they become a whole lot easier . The story is nice . 2 people trying to escape a city full of undead living thingy creatures and such . Theres alot of other characters though , you are n't the last 2 humans alive in the city . The game even though was known to have a sequel considering tremendous profits , finishes great . It starts randomly , but then ends where it should . It succeeds in making a good game . Good story , some action , you get to kill some of those evil zombies , and good package .	1

Capcom followed up the surprise success of the original Resident Evil with this blockbuster smash in 1998 . Resident Evil 2 had everything the original had plus tons more ; bigger more detailed environments , weirder puzzles , more suspense , more blood and gore , and a compelling story that kept the gamer on the edge of their seat . In this installment you play as rookie cop Leon Kennedy or Claire Refield : the sister of Chris from the first game . Instead of a secluded mansion like the first game , this time all of Raccoon City has been infected by Umbrella 's virus and you have to wade through an assortment of flesh eating zombies , mutated dogs , hunters , a new monster called the Licker ( whose introduction in the game is one of the most unforgettable parts in any video game ) , and some unbelieveably grotesque beasts who will stop at nothing until your dead . Resident Evil 2 was an instant smash hit upon it 's release and has since been regarded as a classic video game and an essential play for any gamer . Since then , the game has been re-released on other systems such as the Dreamcast , Nintendo 64 , and most recently the Gamecube ; so now gamers of any generation can play one of the most addicting and innovative games of all time .	1
I just loved RE 2 when it came out and even more scary then the first game . you play as Leon Kennedy or Claire Redfield . there is one area in the Police station that when I went down a Hall..Scared the hell out of me and made me actually jump from my chair . that 's the type scare I enjoy.it was that good because you did n't expect it . every time I play this game and come to that place in the game never fails to make me jump.. this game has two hidden characters . Plus based on who you play Leon or Claire , you met two new characters in the game.I recommend this game to any fan of the Resident Evil series .	1
AFTER GETTING INTO `` RESIDENT EVIL `` I KNEW THIS GAME WAS OUT FOR A WHILE NOW , SO I DECIDED TO PICK IT UP ! ! IT WAS A VAST IMPROVEMENT OVER THE FIRST GAME .

This game was a great survival horror advernture . I still like 3 for some reason but this should be owned by every psx or gc owner . The story is very good and interesting . The game has two disks . Each character has there own 2 versians . LEON has 2 different ways of the game . There are the A and B games for each character . LEON and CLAIR have both a 's and b 's . I like all versians even though the b gives you an extendid deed to do in the game and shows you the true resident evil2 game ending wich leads to the events to resident evil 4 ! The game disks should take about 6 to 9 hours if you dont have a guid . The a and b games are both pretty difficult if you dont have a guid . The game is amazing and has a great character desighn like ada wong . Sad how it ends for leon even thoe the b game leaves you wanderin about her during your fight with the new mutated tyrant in his b game . Over all this is one of the best in the series next to 2 and remake.Leon returns in the next resident evil game wich is in titledResident Evil 4Get 2 cause you wont be dissapointed . Its a psx classic . I have bin playing that game since I got it and that was about in 1998 wich is when it came out.So go get it psx gamers .	1
Resident Evil 2 was one of the best Psx games back in the mid 90 's as it had exclusive rights to Sony . The game was the sequal to one of the best Survival Horror game ever . Does this do better then its prediseccor ? ... YES . OH HELL YES . The game is a solid good game . The story line is really entertaining but it was more of a sci fi then a horror story . I wo n't spoil the story for you but the game is 2 discs and you control 2 characters ( serpartly ) in the game . One is a cop named Leon Kennedy and the other is female after her missing brother Chris ( who was in RE1 ) and the two end up meeting eachother and the rest you can figure out..I really enjoyed this game , it was fantastic . I loved the graphics for this game it was just `` wow '' . The game is pretty short if you play only one half of the character you play as . They both have 2 parts ( kina ) . Once you complete that characters game it opens up the second of half of the other character . The game is fairly lenghy if you play the WHOLE game . The game has some great twists that 'll keep you up all night . Lemmi make it easier for you ... Resident Evil 2 was one of the coolest Playstation games ever . It had an awesome story line , sweet graphics and decent dialoug . It is also spooky in the scare factor especially when you see something crawl around a window in the beggining of the game . In other words the game is awesome and scary.The graphics for that time were just great and comparable to Metal Gear Solid . The character model for Leon and Clair was amazing and the zombies looked even more creepy then before , not to mention the bloody gore in this game ... .jeez . Capcom did a great job making the graphics . kudose..The gameplay is what really made me love this game . Gun n ' down zombies and solving puzzle ... my type of game baby . The Puzzle are not that hard but they are pretty cool . The gameplay never gets boring and the boss fights are really cool . The gameplay may turn some off in the beggining . Mainly cause it 's just runing away from zombies but later on that will change ... trust me..The sound is incredible ! The zombies sound so realistic and the music for the boss fights are magnifecent ( my spelling sucks I know ) . The sound it self deserves a one star ... What turned me off was the `` kina cheezy sci fi '' story . It did n't have the same spooky feeling Resident Evil 1 had in story ... which causes me to take off one star ... Well yeah it was a stupid move just for that but hey that 's my opinion ... The games has amazing graphics , great sound , lots of awesome gameplay and is one of my favorite video game series . Not only that it may possibly be the best in the series if not then It 's 3.This game deserves a4.8 out 5 ... .Resident Evil series is a superb series and anyone who loves survival horror will love it . I personaly think it 's one of the best gaming series out but I do n't have ALL the resident Evil games.. The only ones I have are the one that go with the story like the ones I have areAnd for any newbie out there who is trying to get into the series , if you have a gamecube and get the remake of the original and start with that ... then 2 , 3 then Resident Evil zero which is a really enjoyable Resident Evil game ... WellLates..	1
This game is precious because it introduced Claire Redfield , Leon S. Kennedy , Ada Wong , and Sherry Birkin . Where would we be without Claire , Leon and Ada ? They are a big part of what makes the Resident evil Series , without them , it would n't be nearly as good ! The Best part about this game is the Leon/Ada Kiss in Leon 's B scenario : )	1
The second instalment of the classic Resident Evil series remains the biggest and the best . With four missions it is a massive game and each scenario adds its fair bit of challenge . The ending to the B scenario is mind-blowing , absolutely brilliant . There is a superb plot and it is great the way that the two scenario 's ( i.e . Leon A & amp ; Claire B ) run parallel to each other and fit in with the storyline . Some people say that this is a bit short but when you finally complete all four scenario 's on easy and hard mode then you will truly appreciate the challenge that this game has to offer . There are extra games such as the HUNK and TOFU scenario that add even more depth and challenge to an already massive game . The police station gives a very atmospheric setting to the game and the new batch of monsters can also give you a hard time . This is a landmark game for the Playstation and the whole Resident Evil series is fantastic . Hopefully , this quality of gaming can continue onto the Playstation 2 .	1
This game kept me dreaming as a child back in the late 90 's . I used to crave Resident evil 2 and its `` So realistic graphics '' ( Hey , Back then , Ps 1 Was Awesome Graphics . ) Its Scary , Its Frightening , And its Impossible to beat with just a knife . Give it a shot , Only downside is poor Voice acting , Like their captain obvious or something . But if you Played RE 3 this will seem like a Downer game . RE directors cut is where its at !	1
A bad ass game live the whole series on the game so far they did a great job on making these games and lost this one and had to have it again	1
Few games have endured in my collection like Resident Evil 2 . The graphics are old , dated , and painful in the year 2011 where Dead Island and Dead Rising 2 are the dominant Zombie games . But it looks well enough to play for days and months on end . The gameplay is clunky and clumsy , but it is a horror game designed to make you feel inadequate and somewhat unprepared for the adventure you are thrown into . The story is Sci-Fi Originals bad and in hard to understand , but that was what they were going for.Honestly , everything about the game should not work . It does alot wrong , but it does MORE right . Yes , it all meshes together into a really good game . Yes , in a few years it will be a painful to play as , say , Pitfall for the Atari , but even when it is thriteen years old it is still F-U-N to play.I played it non-stop when I had my PS1 , continued to play it with my PS2 , and even now , after I got an Xbox 360 and play other games , I still plug up my PS2 and play some RE2 once and awhile . Yes , I can see the blocky graphics , bad audio , and ect , but I LOVE this game . It 's my favorite of all time . I can give you a detailed walkthrough RIGHT NOW for every scenario in the game.Get this game if you Love Killing Zombies . Get it if you love puzzles . Get it if you love guns . Get this game period .	1
Resident Evil 2 picks up a little after the original game in the series . The virus that the evil Umbrella corporation has been researching managed to get out into the open , and people have been dropping dead like flies as a result . The story begins when two central characters are separated in a car crash , and both try to survive long enough to work out what on Earth is going on in Racoon City . It sounds like a very basic , even threadbare plot , and to tell the truth , it is . But therein lies the charm of Resident Evil and most all of its sequels . One can go anywhere , do anything , kill anything , and apart from the frustration of winding up with nowhere to go at times , the game will not penalise the player for it . In this day and age where racing simulators are nothing more than knowing which lever to jerk when , it makes for a nice change.Of course , as the main influence makes clear , the player soon finds themselves battling with undead citizens ( and worse ) throughout the course of the game . Those who like to kill everything in sight may find the going a little tough , as the game rewards the player for knowing what to kill and when . A zombie in a wide , open area does not require immediate shooting , but a licker in a confined space should be put down as quickly and quietly as possible . Knowing the difference can literally decide whether you complete this game or not . But if one does get into a situation where they are low on ammunition and are not sure where they are meant to go , they can simply keep exploring until a solution presents itself . Such is the quality of the artwork on offer that it takes a while for this to become boring.One criticism of the game that is perfectly valid is that the zombie models only seem to have four varieties . Occasionally , different types will appear if certain conditions are met , such as not picking up any items during the trip to the police station , but for the most part , it is a rather generic bunch . Another problem is the save point system , which can make the quest seem repetitive at times if resumed . However , the fun of the game truly lies in revealing threads of the plot , which , while occasionally clich & eacute ; , is put together like an elegant series of Chinese boxes . Questions are raised constantly , and half the fun is in finding the answers . In a complete contrast to the second feature film , the motions and attacks of the enemy are completely consistent , and even make sense from a biological point of view . One other criticism I have that applies to all of the Resident Evil games I have played to date is that in so-called tense moments , when a mass-attack by zombies or other terrors begins , one can often tell when they have completely beaten off their opposition by when the background music calms down . Although I am not entirely sure that is a bad thing.The replay value of the game is heightened by the ability to complete one character 's quest , save the results , and use them on the other 's . What one does in one game directly affects what happens in the other . Decisions such as who should take the submachine gun , for example , are of great importance in the game , as are such things as opening doors or killing certain major enemies . Getting into the underground lab towards the end of the game is quite a chilling moment , too . Notwithstanding the fight that takes place on the way down , this deserted research lab is enough to put the wind up any a dedicated viewer of horror films . A contrast , as it were , to the godawful second film adaptation.If I were giving Resident Evil 2 a score , it would be ten out of ten . Sure , it is looking old considering it was originally released on the PlayStation and Dreamcast , but unlike the vast majority of games , it has the ability to withstand the test of time . It is well worth hunting around the stores that specialise in second-hand or liquidated stock for .	1
This game is pretty good for its own sake . It 's basically about a dead warrior in a land of ghouls & zombies who attack him at every turn , & it is up to you to find the Chaos Rune , among other hidden treasures arrayed throughout this underworld of bizarre incarnations.The animations are up to 3-D par , although I will remark on the variety of different angles . The graphics are japanamistic , but nonetheless amusing .	1
This game is interesting . My sister made me pick it up and it is fun to mess around with . If you are looking for a cute little adventure platformer then this is it . The graphics are good and the control is n't too tricky . It does get difficult in parts but not overly . I am not a huge fan of platform games but this one got me with its unique humorous tones . Give it a shot on your PS2 if you have n't . It 's a bargain .	1
This game has very good graphics for a PS game and the action and music.The game is very good and has 22 worlds , although they 're short.What I dont like is that , you can only save when you pass a world , and thats bad because if you 're doing perfect in the world but then you die , you 'll have to do it all over again.The game has 4hands up and 1con , so I recommend it if you like zombie killing , horror action games .	1
This is a fun game.There are some better games in the history of PlayStation games , such as Crash Bandicoot : Warped , which is not violent , like this is just a little.But it 's great enough to be given at least 5 stars .	1
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST ENJOYABLE GAMES , I 'VE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE TO PLAY ! ! IT IS FAIRLY SIMPLE , NOT TO MENTION LOADS OF FUN TOO ! ! THERE ARE ONLY A FEW HARD BOSSES , BUT WORTH THE PLAYING TIME . ONE TIP , ALWAYS STOCK UP ON AMMO , AND USE THE FOUNTAIN OF REJUVINATION ALWAYS .THROW YOUR DRUMSTICKS AT ENEMIES FOR HEALTH PICKUPS ; BUT YOU GET THEM LATER IN THE GAME . USE YOUR CROSSBOWS FOR BOSSES -AND PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE BOOKS SCATTERED THRU THE LEVELS .THEY GIVE YOU CLUES.ALL IN ALL IF YOU YOU WANT TONS OF FUN , THEN GET THIS GAME ! YOU 'LL CERTAINLY PLAY IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN ! !	1
So I was seting up for the next stream and then I found this lying around , I started to remember `` Oh man this game was a lot of fun '' so I started to play it again and it still is fun today . So here I am sitting here on Amazon.com and figured `` well since my next stream is going to be for a Playstation game why not this first ? `` MediEvil is a hack and slash game involving the undead , but unlike popular games that involves zombies in some way like Resident Evil this one is less ... .realistic . The game has a cartoon feel and the back of the box even says that , I usually love cartoons and this one fits the bill in terms of both comedy and graphics . The story is that there is this story teller for a king who kind of went off the deep end by saying he slain an evil wizard named Zarok . Zarok , who overhears this , decideds to declare war and horrified by this and believing in Fortesques ( the story teller ) story he sends him out to battle but Daniel goes down at the first shot with a welhelm scream and everything . 100 years later Zarok returns but so does Fortesque but this time the cowardly knight is a skeletal one.MediEvil 's controls are a little awkward but once you get the hang of them it becomes quite nice , the atmosphere of this game is dark and gritty but not too much . As I said before the gameplay is a hack and slash type thing like God of War but less gory ... much , much , much , much , MUCH less gory than that game and it does throw around puzzles . The game does beg for you to get every single chalice ( collectables ) by throwing in a lot of challenges that can make it easier to complete if you have a certain weapon such as enemies having an insane amount of health and would take literally forever to kill with your second to strongest sword . Because of this getting a 100 % on this game is really easy and there is no bad ending for doing a No Chalice run if you so wish to do so.The music is outstanding and some of it is memorable , one of my favorite tracks is the ending theme of this one , the music is compose of a synthesizer and other normal instruments.So how would I rate this game , well I think this game is perfect and is and always on the number one spot of my top ten list of favorite games of all time . For that this game gets a 10/10 stars from me , music , gameplay , and graphics are always great and the controls are a bit awkward as I said but once you get used to it then this game is a blast . ALL HAIL SIR DANIEL FORTESQUE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
So much fun.My husband and I played this game til we all but wore it out.We still have it , and now that we 're back into gaming again , intend tohook up the PS and play it still . It 's just that good.I wish someone would come out with an updated version for the Wii or later , b/c we 'd def buy it !	1
As part of the core Team at SONY Computer Entertainment that worked on the development of the Crash series , and helped propel Naughty Dog into the Video Game Industry as a premier Developer , with these million seller Crash games . I 'm proud of what we did , and I STILL enjoy the Crash Bandicoot gameplay and graphics . Buy them up folks . I had to buy these because my little girl gave my copies to her little friends back in the '90s . I had n't given it much thought until now , and realized that I just had to have my own copies again . Yes , I STILL have PlayStation 1 , 2 , & 3 consoles and WILL buy the second generation PS-4 .	1
This item was purchased as a gift for my Grandson , it was requested by him and his mother , they both love the game . It has worked flawless since they received it .	1
Crash Bandicoot is one of my oldest games on my oldest system , the Playstation . Still , I have never grown tired of playing levels , which used to be challenges that now I pass with a breeze . The levels are awe inspiring . Water is flowing without a crack , the jungle is incredibly lush , and the characters have no mistakes from their hair to their sneakers . Story is interesting too-you have to save Crash 's girlfriend Tawna from Dr. Neo Cortex . The only disadvantage is the limited controls-jump and spin . This game brought two sequels and two other games that involve racing and mini games . No wonder .	1
This is a classic game that I come back to every now and again . The graphics are great and the content is really satisfying . But I do have a complaint of the actual difficulty of the game.1st island - The easiest to beat if you have all of the different coloured gems . The hardest level here is Native Fortress.2nd island - Slightly harder but still fun . The hardest level here is Sunset Vista.3rd island - The most frustrating . I spent half an hour to beat Generator Room with Perfect and another half an hour with Toxic Waste . The hardest level here is Slippery Climb.I do n't get why a kid 's game can get difficult to beat . I mean , I own mature games like Jak 2 and Oblivion and they are a whole lot easier by comparison . If you are looking for a challenging game , this is your cup of tea . But if you want a kid 's game that you can just glide through , I recommend Spyro .	1
Great game , fun old classic , very basic and easy to catch on to . Much funner than the first one .	1
Crash Bandicoot 's my favorite video game character and all his work is genius . I 'm looking forward to his latest video game installment , Crash Tag Team Racing . The game 's graphics are good , the gameplay itself sounds amuzing , and the trailer ( on GameSpot ) prove how visually stunning it 's going to be too . But , Crash 's humble beginning is not the same as Mario and Sonic 's were . It was much better , more creative , and bigger.Mario 's was just an arcade game . It was hard , but it did n't take to long to master it , and I do n't even know if there was a boss . Sonic 's debut was better then Mario 's . A game you could play without spending money , good levels , challenging , better bosses , and a special ending you could view if you collected all the items necessary . But , these debuts lacked what Crash 's had . Most challenging , best bosses , better secret ending , and most of all , a 3-D world to play in.Crash 's world is not fully 3-D in this game ( in fact up till Crash Twinsanity , none of them have been ) , but it is very good as far as it goes . The VIRTUAL world looks like the REAL world . That 's one of the game 's strongest points . The controls are very solid and Crash responds amazingly well to your commands . This spoiled me . I 'd play a Crash game and then go play something else with looser controls and be upset by the lack of response . I became versatile after a while though . Crash lacks moves in this game , but he has more then Sonic and/or Mario had in their debut games . Crash has 3 , Mario and Soinc only had 1 . Crash 's moves are running , jumping , and spinning . The spinnig move is an extremely creative thing . To make up for Sonic 's spin , Naughty Dog brought out the bigger and better guns . Crash 's spin is much easier to control and is much more effective . It also does n't threaten you in a strange , almost indescribable way . Sonic 's spin reqired that you dash in the direction that you were facing before you started spinning . Sega called this the spin dash . This could throw you to your death . Not Crash 's . Crash could move or stay still when spinning . Note : Soinc did n't have the spin dash in his debut game . Mario and Sonic 's jumping , I 'll admit , was better . They were tighter then Crash . Their direction could be changed much , much easier then Crash when jumping . Crash jumps higher though . Crash runs kind of slow , especially when you need to get something done . But he 's slower in Crash Twinsanity . Crash 's camera control is hardly ever a problem . Every once in a while you 'll have to strain your eye a little , but it 's still a better camera then Soinc 's . Mario 's is best out of all , though , 'cause you could see the entire level all at once.As for the other features of the game , they 're pretty outstanding . The levels are big and challenging . There 's also secret levels in Crash . I 've never seen anything like that in Sonic 1 or Donkey Kong , have you ? No , I did n't think so . Crash 's biggest flaw is the saving system . In the game , you must collect 3 tokens of Crash 's girfriend 's head ( hidden in the level ) to get to a bonus area . You must get to the end of the Tawna ( Crash 's girlfriend 's name is Tawna ) Bonus Round , touch Tawna ( who 's just standing there ) , and then exit the Tawna Bonus Round via a warp pad in order to save . If you do n't do exactly what I said had to be done in order to save , you do n't get to save . Not fair at all . But , it 's still better then Sonic 1 or Donkey Kong , 'cause you ca n't save at all in those games . There are also two other kinds of bonus rounds in the game , The Cortex ( main bad guy of the game ) Bonus Rounds and the Brio ( Cortex 's right-hand man ) Bonus Rounds . You ca n't save in these bonus rounds , even if you get to the end of them without falling off the platforms . Oh and get this , there are n't Tawna Bonus Rounds in all the levels , so you do n't have a chance to save if your parents tell you to get off and you 're in a level like Hog Wild where there 's no bonus rounds . Big flaw . The 2nd biggest flaw is the way you have to collect gems . In the game you must collect 32 ( I think ; do n't quote me on that number , because I 'm not sure ) gems in order to see the secret ending . However , it 's a little too hard to collect them all . I understand most people think the game 's not hard enough , but I think it 's a little too hard . To collect a gem , you must destroy every single crate in a level and get to the end without losing a life . I 'm all for destroying every crate , but I think you should be able to lose a life and still get the gem . It should only matter if you destroy all the boxes.So , if you 're wanting to compare Mario and Sonic to Crash , I 'd say Crash all the way . And , as you can see , if you 're reading this , Crash 's 1st game was much better then Mario and Sonic 's . I say Crash is best , no matter what anyone else tells me .	1
I gave this to a young man as a gift . He is very excited about the game and has enjoyed it very much . He is happy and thinks it is just what he wanted . I am not familiar with the product , but if he is happy ... I am happy .	1
Graphics : 8/10 - These are often stunning but at times a bit murky . Mostly they are really fabulous to look at , though , in every scene the makers of Crash have put in a lot of effort.Sound : 7/10 - The animals could 've made some more sounds but the creatures that talk do it clearly and well . Mostly the score is playing in the background so there is n't much sound to be heard.Value : 9/10 - Value for money indeed ! Once you 've finished , you 'll want to start all over again ! Overall : 8/10 - Great game with an excellent reputation . Crash 2 and 3 surpass it slightly , but this is still an easy-on-the-brain , fun and original idea .	1
YOU CAN NOT MISS THE CHANCE TO OWN ONE OF THIS IF YOU LIKE CRASH BANDICOOT GAMES	1
Let & # 8217 ; s go back in time to one of my favorite PlayStation icons : Crash Bandicoot . For those who don & # 8217 ; t know , Crash Bandicoot is a fictional Eastern Barred Bandicoot who was genetically enhanced by the evil Doctor Neo Cortex who then escaped and set out to stop the evil scientist and his plans . Crash would appear in many games , but the ones I hold dear are the original three on the first PlayStation : Crash Bandicoot , Crash Bandicoot 2 : Cortex Strikes Back and Crash Bandicoot 3 : Warped . With that said , let & # 8217 ; s take a look at the first one in the series.The first Crash Bandicoot game was released way back in 1996 with Naughty Dog developing the game , Sony Computer Entertainment publishing it and Universal Interactive Studios being the distributors . It was a PlayStation exclusive , but would eventually get re-released as a PS One Classic on the PlayStation Store to be played on the PlayStation 3 . The game is definitely kid friendly and appropriate for all ages , Crash Bandicoot is basically a Mario ripoff but a very good one none the less who came up with several original ideas . The story goes that Crash Bandicoot was created by Doctor Neo Cortex and his henchmen Doctor Nitrus Brio . Crash escapes the experiments but leaves his girlfriend Tawna in the process and Crash is swept up to an island and sets out to go rescue her and stop the villains . What & # 8217 ; s weird is that this is the only Crash Bandicoot game on the PlayStation in which Tawna appears in , I don & # 8217 ; t know why though , it & # 8217 ; s definitely unusual . But nonetheless , let & # 8217 ; s continue with the game.The first thing that stands out are the graphics , the graphics for 1996 looked fantastic , they were even better than Super Mario 64 on Nintendo 64 which was released a month later . It definitely gets an A+ for presentation . The game was a huge hit and was the first non-Japanese game to achieve commercial success in the country . Now , let & # 8217 ; s discuss the actual gameplay.The game is nonetheless a platformer in which you control Crash Bandicoot across three islands to defeat Doctor Cortex and rescue your girlfriend . The game is split into levels with one basic goal : get to the end without dying . You start out with four lives and its one hit deaths from being touched by enemies or falling into water or a pit . Yeah , it & # 8217 ; s weird how water kills Crash even though he fell in the water at the introduction and was floating away to one of the islands and survived . Why is it that these characters who are very athletic can & # 8217 ; t figure out how to swim ? I hate games that do this because when you see water , you & # 8217 ; re never sure if the game will allow you to swim . It & # 8217 ; s stupid and what & # 8217 ; s weird is that in the third game Crash does swim underwater with scuba gear . So really the game is a huge contradiction of itself.You can get more one ups by finding them across levels or collecting 100 apples which are basically the coins of Super Mario Bros , but the apples are everywhere in this game so it & # 8217 ; s really easy to get a one up , you could literally get at least three lives per level . Attack moves include jumping in the air and landing on an enemy or using a spin move in a tornado fashion to knock enemies off-screen , I like that , even if it & # 8217 ; s a rip-off of Super Mario World . You also find this Mask that helps you on your journey , if you find it , it gives you an extra hit point , but you don & # 8217 ; t actually wear the mask it just follows you . If you get three masks without losing one , you turn invincible for a brief time much like the Starman & # 8217 ; s in Super Mario Bros.The boxes are also a rip-off of Super Mario Bros. in which they have question marks on them and you have to destroy the boxes to gain prizes . But not all boxes are the same , there are boxes without question marks , arrow boxes that propel you in the air , boxes with exclamation marks which makes boxes appear out of nowhere , checkpoint boxes that act as a save spot for the level and TNT boxes which explode after three seconds when you jump on them , whatever you do , don & # 8217 ; t spin attack them because they will immediately explode.A strange feature in these boxes is that you can get Tawna tokens that act as a bonus level so you can get some extra fruit and one ups . What & # 8217 ; s weird is that Tawna is in this level but she doesn & # 8217 ; t let you rescue her for some odd reason , but what & # 8217 ; s even stranger is that completing the bonus level is the only way to save the game or get a password . I don & # 8217 ; t understand why early PlayStation games didn & # 8217 ; t allow you to save anytime you want . Every video game that can support a memory card should do that , I hate writing down passwords so I can continue . But the password is only eight digits and the main buttons on the PlayStation controller act as the characters so it & # 8217 ; s at least not a long and annoying password.If you complete an entire level without losing a life and manage to destroy all the boxes , you & # 8217 ; ll get rewarded with a gem , this was a flaw with the game because it makes the game way too damn hard and every future Crash Bandicoot game let you get the gem even if you die as long as you break all the crates . Some gems can act as platforms to help you get across areas that are impossible to reach , much like the vine in Super Mario Bros.Now while this game has some flaws , it & # 8217 ; s still a good game overall , it & # 8217 ; s not as good as the second and third game , but it & # 8217 ; s definitely fun and enjoyable . The creativity is good , has a good challenge and the graphics are fantastic . If you have a PlayStation Network account , give this game a chance , it & # 8217 ; s only $ 6 on the PlayStation Store so it & # 8217 ; s not expensive or anything . It & # 8217 ; s definitely a classic.FINAL RATING : 8 out of 10	1
I have never managed to beat the game , ca n't imagine how some people claim to do so in 5 hours . My 5 year old has finally figured out how to play these games on the playstation . She was getting frustrated with Crash , until I found the code that allows you to go to any level and play . Plus if you go to the Castle Machinery level first , you get 20 some free lives and then can go where you want . Find the password screen and punch in : T ( triangle ) , T , T , T , X , S ( square ) , T , T , T , T , S , X , T , O , T , T , T , O , S , T , X , X , X , X . Maybe it is cheating , but for us folks that have a hard time beating the game , it makes playing it more fun !	1
This game took me quite a few tries to get , but now that i got it , i played the heck out of it . one of my faves , for i have the 2nd and third part . I just wish someone could tell me how to go about getting all the gems after u defeat cortex on this first part i got here .	1
when famous sonic was out now enter bandicoot . this story tell about myster that can be destoryed a dr neo cortex was a mad scitent which ordered nitus brio to create a animals but now cortex have created the bandicoot which can be there leader.all animals where out of control only crash survies konwing that cortex was a bad guy now he most jonury throrugh places to get back to cortex fortess .	1
I tried the Crash 2 PlayStation game about 1998 and it was delightful . It was , in fact , so delightful that I looked around for the first part to start from the proper point.When I started playing the first part , I was disappointed by the difference of the story , but , still , It was a nice game.The graphics are excellent . The story is original . It speaks about a genetically engineered dog , named Crash , that resembles human beings . This genetic procedure was done by Dr Cortex ( or more precisely by his degraded assistant ) . Then Dr Cortex goes on the produce a new female version of this Crash . Of course crash falls in love with her . Dr Cortex , being a wicked soul , parts between the two and then Crash needs to go through so many obstacles to reach his lover.So many levels are divided into islands , and each set of levels is followed by a bad boss . Some are hard and some are easy . It depends in your skill in such games . The story is concluded by a battle between this Crash and Dr Cortex . If you win then you got it.And to complicate life even more , the designers introduced the concept of gaining gems . If you get all the gems you can continue the game in a new fashion . I aint saying it 'cause I do n't want to spoil things for you . To attain these gems is a difficult task . As for me , I got them but after being kicked in the teeth for it . You should not even dream of getting the gems in order of levels . No , mon ami , some times you have to go to a certain advanced level to get a `` green gem , '' for instance , to get the gem in the , say , fourth level . You would have to check the net for the tricks , dirty if I may , and the hidden places . Good luck in that.There is `` aku-aku , '' which is a mask that is considered as an extra life if you get touched by any of the enemies . Take 3 aku-akus and you become invincible for some seconds and you kill any of the enemies by a mere touch.Of course , there are saving stations . You do not get to save after every level . This is a drawback . Saving stations are also level you have to jump , crush , step on dynamite , and so on . If you fall down , you can not save , you have to go to the next saving station . It is hare , I am telling you.The game is great , and if you win with a 100 per-cent then you are the man ! Crash 2 ( 5 Stars ) : The Best Game Ever : This game has everything the first part lacked . It has even better graphics . This was the first one of the crash series I tried , and it was fun . Before that , I was hooked on fighting games , like street fighters , and tekken , but they are not that fun after playing it a 100 times or so . In this game you can spend as much time without losing interest.It is , more or less , like the first part . There is aku-aku , boxes to crash , gems ( more difficult ) , new bosses after each floor . And by the by , this game is divided into 5 floors , each floor with 5 doors , each door with a different adventure . You can finish the game , like I did the first time , without collecting gems , but it is not that fun . Hint : If you break all the boxes of one level you are rewarded a gem . There are hidden levels for some gems , you would have to consult the internet for it . Good luck in that.In this part you can save after each level , it is easier in that respect . I find the gems easier to collect than in the first forbidding game . The designs of the adventure is by far better than the firs.The story line is change a little bit . Instead of the `` Pamela Anderson '' of a lover Crash had , he gets a more geeky `` Meg Ryan '' of a sister . Dr Cortex is still missing things up . The assistant from the first part does not appear except when he tries to communicate Crash to warn him from Cortex . You want to know more ? Get the gems first.There is also a sixth hidden floor . You would have to reach it by a trick , and again check the net for that.The game was the best I have ever tried . It makes my life harder , since I can not find better games to play anymore . It will make you look for other adventures of Crash .	1
This is the second best Crash . The best is Crash 2 . The complaints what people will go on are being able to move backwards and forwards like a 2D game , Well it was back in 1995 or so . The game is n't hard until 65 % through.Buy this if you want a very good platformer .	1
This is one hard game . But it is nicely designed thought , in some ways . People may say that the save system and difficulty of levels are not good . But , in my opinion they are just fine . The save system is the worst I have ever seen , but it just makes the game that much harder . The way it works is , for most levels , there is a bonus level . Once you finish that level , which dissapointingly is very short , you can save the game . But , not all the levels have this bonus level , which makes it really hard . You have to get through a few levels in some cases to get to a bonus level . And the thing is , each time you load the game , it starts out with four lives , no matter how many you had when you saved . So that makes it really hard . What you have tio do is play the levels in the beginning to rack up lives . But get this : once you play the level once and collect all the lives , you can not collect many more . If you play it again , you will not be able to get as many lives as before . The boxes normally filled with lives are now just filled with fruit . Collect 100 and get another life . But that takes a while . And also , you can only play the bonus level once . If you save the game and try to play it again , you ca n't . So , you really have to work hard . Pacman World is so much easier than this . With this , you really will get frustrated . It is not as fun as Pacman World , or Crash Bandicoot 2 . That is a better game than this one . But , for a first try , the company did a good job . The music is one of the best things in this game . Crash 's powers and moves are limited though , but the graphics are good for 1996 . It is 2011 , I know , but it is not too late to buy this game if you have a playstation 1 or 2 . But be ready for a challenge .	1
I remember when I first got this game with a Playstation console in early 1998 . It was a great phenomenon then , because the Crash Bandicoot series was able to bring some new life to the platforming genre of gaming with its 2D and 3D interchangeable levels.Crash must go through 25 levels and 6 bosses in this game , but unlike the later games in the series , Crash must tackle the levels chronologically by progressively going through 3 islands.While the gameplay is fun and interesting , the game has its flaws as well . First off , you can only save when you either complete a bonus round ( which can only be access one time in each level ) or when you collect a gem for destroying every crate in the level . This gets frustrating , because in order to get each gem , you must complete the level and break the boxes without losing a life , plus the fact that colored gems are required to complete certain levels . If I were you , I would n't worry about the box gems just yet and just try to find the bonus in the newer level you are at if you want to call it a day . You may have to do the newer level again , which tends to be a flaw.Despite this , I highly recommend this for fans of previous platforming games like Donkey Kong Country and Sonic the Hedgehog . While the series would improve , this is not a bad start .	1
I 'm semi serious about this . This game is tough . It 's an excellent platformer , one of the all time best for that matter , but some of the levels are rage inducing.Crash is the perfect mascot/icon for Sony and they let him go . At the time when Sony needed one , Crash was there and sold systems . He was the face of Playstation and it 's baffling why they did n't hang on to him . Just ask Nintendo or Sega what the advantages of a mascot are . Nintendo is dead without Mario and after many failed attempts , Sega is still trying to resurrect Sonic . Crash was perfect for Sony . He 's funny , has attitude , likable and recognizable and the games we 're the first , really good 3D platformers for the next generation . He also provided a stable franchise for the younger audience , which every company knows they want and need . What happened here ? Man , I remember the commercials when a guy in a Crash outfit went to Nintendo headquarters and stood outside with a bullhorn and was taunting Mario , daring him to come out . Classic . That was Crash . Sony really dropped the ball here.Crash has never been the same since Naughty Dog let him get away . Other developers have made some very uninspired sequels with him , changing his looks , alliances and even voice . I know you ca n't do the same thing forever but none have come close to the success of Naughty Dog , when they held the reins of this franchise . Today , Crash sits in a woeful state , being made to participate in very un-Crash-like games.This game started it all though . This changed the platformer forever . While Mario and Sonic we 're still going left to right in their side scrolling adventures , Crash took us into his world with glorious 3D . It said something about the future of games and consoles at the same time and it was only on Playstation . Even today , this is a very challenging platformer . Amidst the Ratchet 's , Jak 's , Sly 's and 3D Mario 's and Sonic 's , the original Crash is about as tough as there is . But it 's also compelling enough to want to keep going . You never do n't know how your going to get through the level ( they 're linear afterall ) , it 's getting the right timing and touch to do what needs to be done . There are some truly insane levels here that will test all your patience and nerve . But you 'll just want to keep trying , at least till you get to your next save point so you know you do n't have to do the level again that you just did . Fortunately , there 's plenty of fruit and extra lives , but your gon na need them all.The audio , video , and play mechanics in the original Crash trilogy are spot on . These games still look , sound and play great today . They 're a very few of the only original PSone games I can bare to look at , let alone play anymore . The look is perfect with bright colors and varied enviornments and the music and sounds are catchy and perfect for each stage . These games have aged extremely well and are a real tribute to the developers at Naughty Dog.There are a couple of downsides though . These games are really tough , maybe too tough for the average gamer or especially child . Some of this is intentional design and some I feel maybe the fact that 3D platforming was in it 's infancy at this time . Some of the angles on jumps , just seem a little off . The perspective can make it really tricky . Another problem is that the save points can be a little far between . Not the check points during the levels , they are plentiful and life saving , but the save points . Sometimes , I just wanted to finish a level I 'd been on for a while , save and quit . But then I 'd find that I had to go through another whole level and a half , just to get the bonus round/save point . And even the bonus round was tricky sometimes as it 's set up as a mini level requiring you to get from one side to the other but if you fell along the way , you 'd have to restart the level to get back to it . Again , more challenge and patience testing . My final complaint is that sometimes you 'd have a nice number of lives you 've accumulated from previous levels , say 20 or so , you save , come back and you only start with 4 ! ! ! I want my lives , I earned them ! ! ! On a final note , I downloaded Crash on my PS3 but cant save as it wont , even though PS2 games do , so I have to use passwords . It 's a little annoying but if they did n't provide them , then I 'd really never be able to save.For anyone new to Crash , looking to try it out , do n't let any of this put you off . These ( the first 3 ) are fantastic games overall . They 're among the tip top in the platforming genre and are some of the most challenging but rewarding at the same time . Crash is truly a gaming icon and I hope some way , somehow , that his original developers can one day give him and us another grand adventure worthy of the name Crash Bandicoot .	1
When I got this for my early birthday , I did n't expect that the character would be so cute ! Crash is adorable , which will get you hooked on for about an hour , the fun for another , and the hard for minus a second.Even though it is difficult , you 'll enjoy looking in those eyes , and playing .	1
This is definitely one of the best games you can find . Crash , a bandicoot as his name applies , is out to rescue his girlfriend Tawna from his arch nemesis , the evil Dr. Cortex . There are about 30 levels in the whole game to go through , in which range from extremely easy to almost impossible . The game is probably the hardest of all the Crash games , so anybody who wants a challenge is in for a treat . The graphics range . In some , the graphics will have you staring , and in some , you just plain will not be impressed , but I 'm not saying anything about that . This game has a high amount of replay value as well , and for some levels you will need strategy . The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because of the horrible save system . You can only save if you get to Tawna bonus rounds , ( common ) and complete them , ( not too difficult ) , or collect a Gem , ( medium difficulty to almost impossible . ) If you can overlook the save system , then you 've got yourself a great game .	1
Alright , so I just used naughty for the play on the company name , but it got your attention , aparently , so ... This is the oldest Naughty Dog title I 've played ( as far as I know ) , however it has a lot of the issues which I 've noticed from their games in the past . Nasty difficulty spikes ( the eight or so level should be closer to the end ) and the 'one path to the end of a platformer ' standard which Super Mario World truely broke when it came out take the one star out of this otherwise superb game.While the graphics are fantastic for PS1 , and moderate at worst for PS2 , sometimes I find it hard to tell where , exactly , Crash is going to land . Also this very much 3D platformer has 'side scrolling ' sections where I become convinced that pressing down will make crash duck , not fall into a bottomless pit , water , or whatever else is in the foreground . Saving can sometimes prove difficult , although , if you look in the right places , you can find a way to save after every significant area . Also , often after completing certain difficult areas , you 'll be able to do them again at any point you desire , good for getting the games bonuses.I have n't finished the game yet ( I 'm only half way through ) , so anything in this review could change , although it 's unlikely . Most Naughty Dog games are consistantly good or bad in every way.Anyway , the bonuses are usually earned by getting through a level opening EVERY box in the level without losing a single life . Others are given through bonus levels , etc.A very great game for a great price .	1
The original Crash ! ! What a wonderful game ! It revolutionized the gaming console ! Created by the Naughty Dog team that went on to create what some consider the greatest PS3 game of all time , Uncharted 2 . Crash is a non stop adventure loved by kids AND adults .	1
I love this game so much because it reminds me of my childhood . I played it for a little bit when I got it , but just love the classic style game overall . Ca n't go wrong for a classic PS1 game .	1
This video game is just great in every way . I am a huge Crash Bandicoot , and none of the Crash game I played beats the original . This game introduced a whole new way of video games and has great graphics for a PSone game . I would recommend this game to anyone old , or young , as anyone can just pick up this game and play it .	1
A very good classic game . I started off playing & # 34 ; Crash Bandicoot Warped , & # 34 ; so I had to buy the original and play it . This was a pretty easy game to beat , but it was fun playing the game that started it all .	1
Having helped bring the series to fruition back in the '90s I had a tremendous opportunity to see and play them . The Developer , Naughty Dog had a great idea , and we at SONY helped them succeed . I love the gameplay , the graphics , the music and the humor . Lots of great animations and funny sounds , such as : & # 34 ; Oombadegha ! & # 34 ; . You 'll just have to play the game to find out what I 'm talking about . I 'm proud to have been a part of the success of this series . The REAL tribute goes to the millions of you gamers who bought the game and enjoyed the fruits of our labor of love . Oombadegha !	1
`` Crash Bandicoot 2 : Cortex Strikes Back '' was a large step up from the first part . This game 's graphics , music , gameplay , and even story were much better than in the first . But it 's kind of weird how Crash Bandicoot does n't end up staying with Tawna Bandicoot and instead ends up living with his little sister , Coco Bandicoot . Well , at least Coco has the ability to speak , unlike her big brother.The voice acting changed dramatically as well , and for the better ( Dr. Neo Cortex 's new voice was much cooler and evil-sounding ) . If you liked the first Crash game , get this one . Although it 's more difficult ( especially in gathering Crystals and Gems ) , it 's really fun !	1
Ah , Crash 2 . One of my favorite games as a little kid . It 's much better than the original.GAMEPLAY : 27 levels , [ 2 hidden ] 25 crystals , 42 gems , and a bunch of secrets ! The warp room allows you to choose 5 levels at a time . There are many weird secrets . Like in the first level , once you get the regular gem , return to level one , and do n't break ANY boxes . You will get the blue gem . Plus , you can save any time , unlike the original . And you do n't have to not die to break all of the boxes.GRAPHICS : Very good for a 1997 game . Everything looks great ! MUSIC/SOUND : The music is very catchy , and the voices are decent.OVERALL : A great platformer for the Playstation ! A must have ! PS : You CAN refight bosses . If you have beaten a boss , hold triangle while going to the next warp roomto fight him again !	1
They told me i would n't get this game for at least another 3 weeks and i got it three days later , AWESOME THANK YOU 100 % .	1
Crash 's 1st game ( as I reviewed ) is my favortie debut game , but his sequel blows me away . There 's one reviewer who says this is an improvement on the original with some sassy style . They 're % 100 correct . The game 's best improvements and worst flaws are all I will list , because you already know where I stand if you 've read my review on the 1st game ( and go check it out if you have n't ) .Best Improvement : Saving System . This allows you to save at anytime , so you 're not going to have to get off ( becuase your parents said so , of course ) without saving all your hard and handy work and having to have to do it all over again.2nd Best Improvement : You have 5 levels to choose from at anytime . You do n't have to go in order.3rd Best Improvement : More moves . Crash is looking good with all his new stunts.4th Best Improvement : Vehicles . Crash gets to drive some neato vehicles , including my favorite , the jet pack.5th Best Improvement : Greater and better bosses , ( including N. Gin ) .6th Best Improvement : Bigger , Better , and More secret levels.7th Best : New characters . I 'm lovin ' the new addition of characters , including Coco Bandicoot , Crash 's sister ( whom I think should 've been in the 1st game ) .8th Best Improvement : It 's easier to collect gems , and there 's a new addition , crystals.Worst Flaw : Well , it would be nice if Tawna had n't suddenly disappeared . I think she should 've been crucial to the entrtie series , not just the 1st game.2nd Worst Flaw : You ca n't revisit bosses without a secret code . You should be able to revisit bosses without having to have to look for secret codes to do so.So , those are all the improvements and flaws . As you can see , better the the 1st game , by far .	1
I used to play this game for hours back in my days and had wondered if it was still around.Sure enough it was.I have joy again	1
Graphics : 8/10 - Really neat little things you might not notice . Sometimes a little too computerized , but still eye-catching.Sound : 8/10 - Very much improved from the first Crash Bandicoot . When things hit the ground , they make a bang , when creatures talk it 's amazingly clear and when you 're in danger , you certainly know by the sound a creature is making , the rumbling of the ground or the thrilling score.Value : 10/10 - This is one game you will start repeatedly and still have the same enjoyment level every time you play.Overall : 9/10 - A big improvement from the great first game . Crash Bandicoot 2 : Cortex Strikes Back has it all - story , characters , levels and fantastically constructed colouring and visuals .	1

This is where the Crash Bandicoot games got really , really good . Everything that the first game got wrong ; the second game got it right . The second game was released in 1997 as a PlayStation exclusive called Crash Bandicoot 2 : Cortex Strikes Back ; obviously reference to Star Wars : The Empire Strikes Back . This game is also available on the PlayStation Store as a PS One Classic to be played on either the PlayStation 3 , PlayStation Portable or PlayStation Vita for only $ 6 so I & # 8217 ; d recommend getting that version if you are interested . Developed by Naughty Dog , published by Sony Computer Entertainment and distributed by Universal Interactive Studios , the second game was better than the first game in pretty much every way . The second game takes place immediately after the first one as Doctor Neo Cortex survives the battle against Crash in the first game and decides to use crystals to power the Cortex Vortex to take over the Earth . He decides to abduct Crash Bandicoot to gather the crystals making him believe he wants to use the crystals to save the Earth . We also meet Crash & # 8217 ; s sister Coco who is suspicious of Cortex & # 8217 ; s true intentions . Meanwhile , Doctor Nitrus Brio who was Cortex & # 8217 ; s right hand man wants Crash to gather gems so he could destroy Cortex and the Cortex Vortex orbiting Earth so we are presented with many people wanting to side with us , all with different intentions.The gameplay is a platformer in which you control Crash Bandicoot across 30 levels to gather crystals and gems . The game takes place in a series of six & # 8220 ; Warp Rooms & # 8221 ; which as the hub areas of the game . Each Warp Room contains five portals leading to a level . The goal of the level is to obtain crystals and gems throughout the path . Crystals are placed somewhere along the path whereas gems are obtained by either destroying all the crates , or in bonus levels or secret levels ; once you obtain the crystal or gem , you have to reach the end of the level , if you exit the level by using the start menu with a crystal , you will lose it . I guess they made it that way to be hard . Once you obtain all five crystals in a Warp Room , you then have to ride the platform in the center of the room to move to the next Warp Room , however you have to fight and defeat a boss character before gaining access . Ripper Roo is back as a boss who is one of the more interesting bosses as he goes from a genius scientist to a mentally unstable psychopath when Crash hurts him , I can & # 8217 ; t help but laugh at this . Then there & # 8217 ; s the fight with Tiny Tiger across floating platform that drop , the goal is to have Tiny be on that platform when it drops and in true cartoon fashion he floats in the air for about a second and then falls , I love that . I was kind of disappointed that the final boss fight was too easy , but whatever.The gameplay is like the first game except with new controls , Crash can now slide across the ground , perform a body slam , crawl on all fours and even slide across the ground and jump immediately to reach higher places . Some enemies can only be defeated by one of these methods so the game has strategy which is nice . The boxes are back which once again have to be broken in order to obtain extra lives and gems . But what & # 8217 ; s nice is you can die and still get the gem without having to restart the level like with the first game . A new famous box is the Nitro Boxes which explode upon any physical contact , but fortunately there is a green colored box with an exclamation mark on it that will explode all the Nitro Boxes in the level once struck . The game also features bonus levels which contain hidden boxes , extra lives and even gems.As a kid , I played the s*** out of this game . It was only recently I managed to beat it 100 % because it is both challenging and fun , but it & # 8217 ; s easier than the first game so if you were expecting a greater challenge , you will be disappointed , but the controls , smoother gameplay and the fact you can save anytime you want as long as you are in the Warp Room makes this game a far superior game than the first one.FINAL RATING : 9.5 out of 10	1
When it comes to Crash Bandicoot I 'll be the first to admit playing the three main games on the PS1 in reverse order was probably a bad idea . The thing is Warped was the only one I had on hand when the urge to play these titles struck , and well , it completely spoiled me . I 'm sure people are probably sick of me gushing over it but Warped was an excellent product and it was refined to the point of near perfection that I honestly would n't hesitate to give it a ten out of ten in conversation or review.The problem with Cortex Strikes Back is it is n't as polished as you 'd expect . I do n't mean this in a superficial way like graphic fidelity ( which is superb for when it was released ) but a `` streamline all the cheap-shots out of the experience '' way . The level of cheapness ingrained in Crash 2 's gameplay is simply astounding and it comes from a variety of places . Things like the hit detection on the belly flop are in dire need of work and the bonus areas are usually the furthest thing from fun when that 's the exact opposite of what they should be . Worse yet are the game 's hidden paths which are essentially sorry excuses to throw everything but the kitchen sink at the player . The kicker to is just when you think you 're done and your guard is down - that 's when they throw the kitchen sink at you.The above situation is a real shame because when you get right down to it Cortex Strikes Back is a beautiful game . The level design and music are excellent as are the graphics which I feel even give Nintendo 64 games a run for their money . But every time the game turns a corner and those memories of the game 's stubbornness start to fade something ( again , there is always something ) shows up and makes it take center stage once again . Compounding the situation is the fact there really is n't enough variety in the levels . Seriously , if I see another level with the words `` Crash '' or `` Bear '' in it I am going to scream and the same goes for the jet pack levels.Annoyances aside , if your a fan of the PlayStation having the three main Naughty Dog-developed Crash titles in your library is a no-brainer . If you have n't played them and want to do yourself a huge favor and play them in order so you 'll be able to appreciate the improvements each sequel brings with it . Unlike some franchises the first three Crash games get better and bolder with each step . As for the game being discussed here , Crash 2 leaves a lot to be desired to in my book but then I ca n't really say I dislike it either . I do wish it was a little better ( polished ) than where it stands now but then that probably a part of why Warped is so good . So while I would definitely warn others of game 's cheaper side I 'd still recommend it to anyone with an interest in platformers .	1
after falling from ballon cortex will crash into a dark cave which cantains power now crash is heading into five warp rooms and new bosses like tiny , komodo bros and n.gin . now crash can even fly in the jet pack .	1
This game is great . It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game . In this game you can high jump , crawl , slide , ride on a jetboat , and fly with a jetpack ! It 's a huge adventure starring ... the Bandicoot ! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals . The level is n't officially complete until you get the crystal . Oh , and you are gon na need a memory card because this game is fairly big . Unless you 're a really hardcore game , then you wo n't need it , but ... it 's recommended . In conclusion , this is a fantastic game , and if you love this , make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3 : Warped !	1
This game has everything the first part lacked . It has even better graphics . This was the first one of the crash series I tried , and it was fun . Before that , I was hooked on fighting games , like street fighters , and tekken , but they are not that fun after playing it a 100 times or so . In this game you can spend as much time without losing interest.It is , more or less , like the first part . There is aku-aku , boxes to crash , gems ( more difficult ) , new bosses after each floor . And by the by , this game is divided into 5 floors , each floor with 5 doors , each door with a different adventure . You can finish the game , like I did the first time , without collecting gems , but it is not that fun . Hint : If you break all the boxes of one level you are rewarded a gem . There are hidden levels for some gems , you would have to consult the internet for it . Good luck in that.In this part you can save after each level , it is easier in that respect . I find the gems easier to collect than in the first forbidding game . The designs of the adventure is by far better than the firs.The story line is change a little bit . Instead of the & quot ; Pamela Anderson & quot ; of a lover Crash had , he gets a more geeky & quot ; Meg Ryan & quot ; of a sister . Dr Cortex is still missing things up . The assistant from the first part does not appear except when he tries to communicate Crash to warn him from Cortex . You want to know more ? Get the gems first.There is also a sixth hidden floor . You would have to reach it by a trick , and again check the net for that.The game was the best I have ever tried . It makes my life harder , since I can not find better games to play anymore . It will make you look for other adventures of Crash .	1
2nd to this is Crash 1 . The graphics are still great ( I got this in 1999 ) and so are the levels . The saving is alot better . I think that you ca n't compare this to Crash 3 and 4 ( on PS2 ) because it 's so much more memorable.BUY IT	1
This is what got me started . I started off with Crash Bandicoot 1 when it first came out . I love the whole concept of it and the games are soo fun . Its exciting and all the levels are different , they have been so creative its amazing.I love Crash and can not wait until it comes out for PS3 .	1
When the first Crash Bandicoot came out in 1996 I was amazed on an old game and game system could have great 3-D graphics and such great game play but it was kind hard . But in this one it 's not as hard because you can crouch , slide and crouch jump so you can jump even higher ! But the graphics are more cartoonish then they are on the first one . But this one had some levels I liked better than on the first one . YOU SHOULD PLAY THIS GAME ! ! !	1
In fact , I always tended to enjoy this one more than the previous , due to the fact that they made it less frustrating at times.In this game , Crash `` helps '' Cortex to `` save the world '' by collecting crystals , despite the fact that Crash 's sister , Coco , knows Cortex 's true intentions . However , Crash does n't know until near the end , due to a terrible signal quality.The gameplay and design has changed a lot with this title . Crash can now use the circle button to duck , slide when moving and crouch jump . There are less levels , but they are divided into five Warp Rooms with five levels each ( with a bonus warp room included ) . Plus you can actually save whenever you please ! Along with these , there are also more level settings , whether it would be the woods , the cold , the sewers , even the ruins . Remember when you rode the hog in the first game ? Well , this time , you ride a polar bear cub instead.You still collect gems in this game , but the mandatory ones are the crystals mentioned before in each level , which are easy to obtain . You still will receive a box gem for destroying every box ( even the new Nitro boxes which should not be touched until you reach the green ! switch ) , except you can use up as many extra lives as you want and still get the gem as long as each box is destroyed . The color gems still serve the same purpose , even though there are only 5 . The gems are more challenging to get and will still give you a reason to keep playing.While this game may seem a bit short , it is still a fun platformer released in the PS1 days .	1
this game is mad fun , gets harder as you go along on the levels and some levels seem to be impossible to flip , but thats the way its suppose to be.i recommend this .	1
This game has lots of advantages.The last game was good , but this one is better.The reason I gave it a four star rading is because it 's hard.It 's possible to do it without the guide , but impossible without a memory card.But you can like it.A good buy .	1
This squeal to the original Crash Bandicoot game lives up to its name . With great gameplay , levels , and new characters , you 'll be setting in front of the TV for a while .	1
This game is a lot of fun ! The environments are adorable and the gameplay is a lot of fun . There is quite a bit of stuff to do and the game is kind of challenging . My only problem is the movement is a little goofy feeling at first , but you will get used to it .	1
I think this game is more than most of the review make it out to be . This game is SUPPOSED to be challenging , and it is not as frustrating as most think . It 's actually really adorable , and has a good setting with cute characters . The camera mode you do have to fiddle with though . But you do get used to it . I was definately hooked on this game , cute , challenging , and fun . 5 stars all the way !	1
This is completely for you this game consists of many things that make it an awesome classicLots to collect5 stars on this # 1 . This is a platform game so theres much to collect such as white crystals they are like your health bar get hit once lose them all but you get about 5-7 seconds to pick them up again after that poof their gone gobbos their hidden all over every level theres 6 in total 5 in the main area and 1 in the secret challange area to get to this you have to collect 5 color crystals to unlock a special door theres also keys in some levels small silver keys are usually to unlock a small cage contaning a button to open a door or a gobbo jumping around speaking its snout off but in some cases theres no switch for this look for a large gold key that will usually open a door with a gold keylock on it the key will dissapear after use. # 24 stars on thisthe controlls are quite comfortable exept this difficulty that haunts me through the whole game is the camera angels it dosent let you adjust it appently it ajusts itself in a in a pretty dumb way which makes it hard to jump from platform to platform making it frustrating to repeat over and over but that can be overlooked with the awesome gameplay # 3 5 stars on this I love the bosses from some that chase and tackle you to some that shoot fire and ice bolts at you some that jump at you from the water not to mention the obstacles like when jumping little fire balls with faces running around a platform or flame or ice blotches jumping up from the ice river or lava river so be carefull when jumping # 4 characters are really cute not much violence in this game but dont be fooled its a pretty tough game itl take a while to beat 100 % so this isnt only for kids # 5 this game is just so well put together i love the music its so calming and relaxing the story is deep without having many cutsceens and the graphics are pretty nice has a few difficulty not as seamless as they say but it still has pretty clear graphics # 6 its just plain awesome oh wait your waiting for cons right THERE ARE NONE ! just the whole camera angle thing but its not much value on the scale of awesomeness so go out get this it will last very long months of entertainment if you want 100 % oh and not to spoil anything but theres special jigsaw puzzle peices that unlock a secret ! ... ... .. well i cant say read the manual and see where it takes you enjoy this great classic !	1
I played Croc 2 more often , but I did play Croc : Legend of the Gobbos when I was young . These games were so fun , as well as difficult ( I never managed to get 100 % completion on either of them ) . The controls are a bit stiff , but this did release in 1997 , so that should be expected . The game is quite difficult and the story itself is quite simple , but the game is fun nonetheless , and for me it 's a pretty timeless classic , that I am happy to add to my collection of childhood memories and video games . Definitely worth the money .	1
I liked this game . In my mind this really isnt a Kids game though . to beat the game 100 % actually requires alot of time and effort . Its more the type of game you can play and kids will watch . The controls are pretty easy . its basically MARIO but your a crocodile exploring diffrent levels , theres really nothing groundbreaking.The game does keep your attention and you will have fun completing the levels . A good game if your a patient person , if not youll wonder why its taking you so long to beat this '' kids '' game and make you feel stupid .	1
I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend . She used to play this game all the time when she was a kid , so I figured I 'd get her a new copy . She loved it . Now , I 'm not so keen on platforming but I promised her I 'd give it a shot . It 's not terrible but the controls are poorly designed . The most fun I had was using the side step buttons to make Croc dance , which is freaking adorable and hilarious . Side step animation is perhaps the single best reason to play it , unless you 're into kinda bad , old platformers . As I said , I 'm not a platformer guy . She loved it though , so if platformers are your thing and you do n't mind super retro design , give it a shot .	1
Doom for PS1 is a great game . Almost every level from Ultimate Doom & Doom II is here , plus some new levels never before seen on the PC . This game is dark , scary as hell , and can really get in your head . The soundtrack is totally different from the PC , and creates a very eerie atmosphere that few games ever do . The controls are easy to learn , that 's a good thing . However , the only reason why I gave this game 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the graphics . Yes , as you may have already read , the graphics are a bit sluggish , especially when compared to the PC version . In my opinion , the best version of Doom is the PC version , period . Doom , Doom 2 , and Final Doom are the best video games ever , in MY opinion .	1
I saw Doom for the first time about 10 years ago when a friend of mine was playing it on his computer ... .and up until that point , playing old 8-bit Nintendo games summed up a fun day for me . Do n't get me wrong , and I 'm not knocking some NES classics here at all by any means , but I must say , I fell in love with Doom the moment I saw it . Too bad the ( ... ) was so hooked too that he would n't let me play.So ... .fast forward to the release of the Playstation ... .and the eventual release of Doom . I bought Doom the first day it came out ... .and my Playstation was n't turned off for 32 straight hours . I ABSOLUTELY love first-person shooter type games , and aside from Rise Of The Triad ( the first FPS I ever played ) Doom turned my world upside down.This is , by far , the best video game on the planet ... .hell , in the universe.The translation from the PC to the Playstation was flawless ... .hell , in my opinion , it 's even better . You get all of the Doom and Doom II levels , and an additional 5 secret levels custom-made for the Playstation only . That 's 59 total levels of mayhem ... .an immersive quest that you can NOT tear yourself away from.Sure , by today 's standards , the graphics are primitive and full of sprites and look a little blocky when you 're up close ... .the enemies and items are modeled in 2D , meaning you can never look at their backside ... .and heck , you ca n't even jump ... .but ... .WHO CARES ? This game is heaven , and even today , will still scare the ( ... ) out of you ... .even if you memorized the location of every enemy in the game , knowing what to expect around every corner.Do n't believe me ? Well try this situation on for size : You just cleared out a room full of Imps and Sergeant Zombies with every last round of shotgun ammo you had . You turn the next corner and hello ... .there 's a Baron of Hell . *Change weapon to BFG9000* ( ... ) , you only have enough ammo for one shot . You aim , shoot , and barely hit the moron . He 's still coming at you ... .and , as you cycle through your weapons ... .you notice only your pistol has ammo left . Oh ( ... ) . *runs*That right there is the definition of fun ... .excitement ... .and horror ... .all making this game the number one video game of all time.11 out of 10 ... .and yes I did that on purpose ... .as Doom is more than perfect ... .	1
After the success of `` Wolfenstein 3-D '' and the birth of the first-person shooter genre , the intelligent , creative teams at ID Software would forge ahead with an even deeper game : Doom . John Romero is hailed for this classic game of monster hunting . Read on to see why this is a classic.THE GOODWell , obviously it 's the `` granddaddy '' of the genre . You get an array of weapons , my personal favorite being the chainsaw . There 's nothing better than chopping up a red demon and watching the blood scatter . The music is also VERY eerie , as if something is about to pop out at you ( even though it never does to the extent of , let 's say , Silent Hill ) . Even though the graphics are outdated , the level designs are very well done and many of them are tricky and cleverly designed . THESE GUYS WANTED YOU TO WORK HARD TO PASS A LEVEL.I also must add that the controls are very customizable . If you do n't have Doom for your computer , this is your best bet on the console . After all , this has Doom , Doom II , AND Ultimate Doom ! THE BADAre you kidding ? ! IT 'S DOOM ! OVERALLEven outdated , this game stands the test of time . You have games today ( not all of them , I 'm not being politically correct , so bite me ! ) that all you do is ... you guessed it , kill people . Doom not only had you kill monsters ( and with bloodlust ) , you had to find the right key to open the door , face MORE monsters lurking behind it , and work your way through seemingly endless labyrinths . Sound hard ? Yes , but that 's the idea ; this is a prime example of the way a first-person shooter game should be done . It 's a shame that future games did n't follow a similar formula ( although Red Faction and Half-Life are your best bets of today ) . In any case , Doom is a classic and should NEVER be forgotten . Grab your BFG and perhaps a Rocket Launcher and HUNT THIS GAME DOWN . You wo n't regret it .	1
Its an unfortunate fact that people are looking to games like the Call Of Duty series to fill their gaming demands when people are also forgetting that this little game called Doom is 1 of few reasons that first-person shooters like Call Of Duty actually exist.Wolfenstien 3-D , another piece from ID Software , was the first real conception of first-person shooters , and then Doom popularized the genre by ID throwing in 2-D and 3-D sensibilities : Practically threw in everything you could say.Doom is an adventure FPS where you play a space trooper trying to figure out what the heck is going on as monsters and demons of Hell invade Earth and then your motivation is to shoot em down with weapons and/or mow em down with a chainsaw : simple as that . I cant tell you how many times i would walk around an area and have monster jump out at me , or walk into a dark area in the game only for something to suddenly jump out ! ! Yes this game is scary ! Even though the game has dated graphics , it still stands the test of time as a true classic and a great investment to anyone willing to play this .	1
This game broke new ground for the video game industry , and not just for the violence , but for the environments and gameplay . This PS1 game is Doom and Doom II bundled into one , and it 's great . Playing it on a PSX or PS2 is just as good , if not better , than playing it on a PC . It 's a blow to political correctness everywhere .	1
Love it or hate it , Doom was indeed one of the most controversial and popular games of the early 1990 's , due to its violent content and satanic imagry . Doom was among some of the violent games that were blamed for the shooting at Colombine High School in Denver , Colorado . Doom was even ordered to be banned by religious protestors . But despite all that , Doom is still one of the hottest shooting games in U.S . It 's my favorite game on the PC . I play almost every day on my computer at home . I would love to own this game on the Playstation because , it is , by far , the best version of Doom ever ! ! I rented it from one of my local movie rental stores , and loved it . The graphics are pretty good , the sounds and music are very eerie , and the animation is excellent . And just like on the PC version , all of the weapons , levels , enemies , and cheat codes are here . If you play this game and love it , also get Final Doom for Playstation . Those who are offended by lots of satanic imagry and bloody action should steer clear .	1
I ca n't say anything about DOOM that has already been said only complainant is due to the fact that it 's on a console it had to cut out levels & parts of levels out . It 's of course a FPS it basically made the 1st person shooters popular cause like every other game now is a d @ * & ntilde ; FPS . But in DOOM you have to solve puzzles find key cards it just was n't about running & gunning . It 's got a simple but effective story in space scientist are experimenting with portals the Demons from h** come through & all h** breaks loose . eventually the Demons come to Earth & you have to stop the invasion . I ca n't do the game justice but yes if you never have played DOOM it 's a great game & you go to war with your 9MM shotgun double barrel shotgun rotary cannon rocket launcher plasma rifle & the Big F**ing Gun !	1
Doom ( 1995 ) . The Playstation rerelease of the 1993 classic , and also including the expansion , Ultimate Doom , and its sequel , Doom II.In this day in age , it 's not that hard to take first person shooters for granted . They 're EVERYWHERE in every shape and form on every system , literally clones of clones in a sense . What 's even harder now is spotting the true gems that stand out within the genre . However , back in 1993 the FPS was unheard of commercially , and as difficult as it is to believe , the genre was a major revolution to gaming . Out of nowhere , the company iD Software showed up and introduced Wolfenstein 3D , the first real FPS . While it does stand as a gaming milestone of the early 90s , it did n't quite take off in the public . What did succeed however was their next project , which consisted of heavy weaponry , lengthy levels , demon slaughtering , BFG 9000s , and key collecting : the legendary Doom.Anyone who first experienced the game back in its height of popularity knows that Doom was n't just a game , but a phenomenon . It has always consumed gamers ( and continues to do so ) into its ever addicting gameplay without compromise . The premise here is really simple : A base on Mars is attacked by Demons through a portal from Hell , and so the higher ups send the whole military platoon in to take care of the situation while you stand guard at the portal entrance . Of course , everyone gets wiped out except for you and now it 's your job to go in and eliminate every last one Hell 's minions . Yeah , it 's a dumb story and it was eventually improved drastically with Doom 3 many years later , but the one aspect that makes these older Doom games superior to Doom 3 is that its simplistic storyline allows you to pick up the game from the get-go . There 's no 30-minute CG cutscenes to introduce the game to you . There 's no hour-long tutorial demonstrating how to play the game . No , immediately upon starting you 're thrusted right into gameplay , and quite honestly I would n't have it any other way . Doom is to 3D what Contra is to 2D gaming : an instant , immersive , and entertaining experience , albeit somewhat mindless.Of course , most Halo and Unreal Tournament gamers of today will blindly slag off Doom simply because the game is old and because of its archaic graphics . Yes , the graphics do date this game a bit , plus its bloody , violent visuals look a lot more like a cartoon now than it did ten years ago , but people need to wake up and realize that a game is not fun solely based on how great the graphics are . The visuals are primitive , but you wo n't really care once you become immersed in the game.Another common complaint about Doom from people now is that `` all you do is shoot monsters and collect keys '' . True , newer FPSs offer different things to do , but people take Doom 's simplicity merely at face value and they seem to miss the point . One thing that Doom has on most other FPS games is in its ingenious level designs . The creators really took the time to make its monsters , levels , and the overall experience memorable in a way that makes you want to come back for more . The differences between Doom and Doom II may only seem like cosmetic upgrades , but as the games go along , the mazes become more and more intricate and cleverly designed . Having story missions and goals to complete is fun , but not at the expense of completely non-linear gameplay . Doom never skimps out on this aspect.Obviously the PC versions of the games are the best ones to play , but for those who happen to have a PS1/PS2 and caught onto Doom at a later date , this version will give you a real bang for your buck . With 2 games and an expansion , the whole package here offers about 60 levels , and 5 difficulty levels of nonstop action . One thing that is improved from the PC version is the sound . All the sound effects and monsters have improved noises , and all the droning level songs from the PC are replaced by an atmospheric , at times errie background soundtrack . As a Doom player for many years now , I believe this makes Doom that much better . Plus , the game feels very natural with a PS1 controller . Also , if you can ever find 2 PS1s , a link cable , 2 Doom games , and 2 TVs , the multiplayer option is well worth it.While other FPS games after Doom added a few new things here and there , very few were able to capitalize on Doom 's greatest strength , which is its design . In fact , the only other FPS series to really impress me besides Doom is Half-life . I know that this review sounds like a bunch of praise , but a lot of the popular complaints are really nothing but hot air . However , I do wish that you could save the game via memory card instead of having to copy down passwords . That 's my only gripe though . I give Doom my highest recommendation to open gamers looking for a challenge and a way to kill time . It 's one of my all-time favorite games . In time , you too will agree that there 's nothing quite like taking out a room full of zombie soldiers with a single double-barrel shotgun blast , jumping out of your seat as a group of angry imps pops out of a `` monster closet '' ( hahaha ) , and dodging ferocious attacks by Barons Of Hell while you find health and attempt to take them out with a shotgun.Replayability : Very high . It 's Doom . That 's all that needs to be said.Other recommendations : -Final Doom ( PC/PS1 ) -Doom 3 ( PC ) -Half-life ( PC ) -Half-life 2 ( PC ) -Jedi-Knight : Dark Forces II ( PC )	1
Doom , Grand Theft Auto 3 , Final Fantasy 7 , Wolfenstein 3D , Resident Evil and Metal Gear Solid there are my favotite games of all time . Doom is definately a classic , the first time I played it on the computer , I was hooked . There 's no telling how many hours I spent on this . As of many , I bought Doom the first day it came out on Playstation years ago . So too all you Halo players that have no clue what Doom is about , everytime you play Halo keep in mind that if Doom never existed most likely Halo would n't exist . The whole Doom series is definately worth owning . The Graphics and sounds are now way out of date but at the time they were amazing . This has some of the most complex levels imaginable , it 'll keep you entertained for hours . So many games today are like so many other games . The ones that are special are the ones that stand out . This game took a risk to be different , and now it stands as being one of the best games ever created .	1
Doom and Quake have been two of the most incredible FPS series ever . Along with Turok and Half-Life , and even Medal of Honor , Doom is still one of my favorites . I do n't even own it anymore , and last time I played it I was about six . While you were all watching Barney the dinosour , my dad and I were blasting demons with rocket launchers and taking out whole armies with a shotgun . I think Doom 3 is really just a remake of Doom 1 , but if I had to choose between the two , I 'd likely choose this one . Doom 3 is awesome and VERY addictive , but it 's so realistic it tends to often freeze up a lot , and do n't even get me started on Quake 4 ... But anyway , Doom was probably the first FPS game I ever played , although with my age , I was n't really good at it at first . But if I were to play it now , I 'd probably be halfway through the game in one day . I never even played Doom II , though my dad did show me the first level of it a long time ago . I wish ID would come out with another game like this , with a simpler story , and gameplay that 's simple like this . I miss these old games a great deal , and not owning Doom anymore is beginning to hurt my brain . There 's just no originality anymore with anything nowadays , it seems like too many things are stereotypical , or just plain typical . Old games are the best , and we need to make sure we get all the classic old games like this while we can , because they wo n't be there forever .	1
This worked just fine . As it was for my daughter I had to have her check it out as this is all Greek to me . Thank you	1
For years , DOOM has been labeled as an evil video game , with extreme violence and satanic imagery.But I say hold on a sec here.I am a Christian myself , and I absolutley love this game.Why you may ask ? ... because you get to destroy demons that are straight from Hell ! ! ! I mean come on ! What Christian wouldnt wan na love doing that in a video game ? ? ? Its not like you shoot people , like in the Grand Theft Auto games.Only people you shoot are fellow marines who are evil and sold out to Satan . So Christians ... .play with an open mind and understand the TRUE meaning of this game . It is good vs evil ! !	1
I had this version in the 90 's and played it while a teenager . I now repurchased it and am playing it in 2008 as a 28 year old . It is STILL visceral , brooding and epic in its dark atmosphere . In some ways , the minimalist `` 3D '' of the original DOOM ( particularly in this port ) lends itself well to the overall gloomy atmosphere . It creates a certain ... menacing bleakness in the landscape.One thing that REALLY makes this a DOOM to remember is the TOTALLY BENT , EPIC DRONECORE DARK AMBIENT SOUNDTRACK . Playing DOOM on my modern computer , despite the incredible graphics , just is n't quite the same without that HAUNTING soundtrack . Seriously , the soundtrack to this particular version of DOOM is so totally harrowing and visceral as to be nearly a moving life experience . You will never quite forget it after hearing it . The soundtrack is certainly one of the best of all time ( for a video game ) . It is profoundly moody , unrelentingly heavy and completely out there . It sounds like something Steve Roach might create after surviving a journey through Hell and then having Trent Reznor as the music producer.Overall , this is quite a good port over to the original Playstation . Original DOOM is an all time classic with brilliant level design and awesome action that set the standard for years . Pick up this version used and fade away into that crazy soundtrack from another level of existence ...	1
Over the past few years , I have experienced many DOOM ports , and most of them were failures . Big failures . But before I go into the review , I 'll tell what I expected out of this game . I expected this to be highly intense , packed full of action , and it to be faster than the original PC versions . But did this really live up to be what everyone expected ? Answer is ... heck yeah ! This port is somewhat better than the PC versions . It has higher resolution , much more faster , and even scarier than the PC versions . People kept complaining that `` Oh my god , this music sucks ! '' Well , in case you did n't know , it was n't supposed to be that weird music . This totally fits the feeling of the game . Another thing they say is `` They should have just made a direct port from the PC to the Playstation . Wow , do we really need another PC port DOOM ? I do n't think so . They have made a billion other PC ports . We really do need another , huh ( sarcastic ) ? So you see , this game did live up to people 's expectations . At least it did for me . Yet some people might beg to differ . So grab this game today and have some bloody fun !	1
To begin this review firsthand if you 're the hi-res FPS and all those sophisticated functions make you happy ? then by all means enjoy.The graphics are 2D and you ca n't duck behind rocks to shoot or yield two weapons at a time ... this is old-school baby ! So 'why rate this game so highly ' you might ask ? well here 's why I like this particular Doom ... *You 'll get Ultimate Doom and Doom II ( which was a dynamite sequel ) with 50+ levels ... that 's a lot of game time . *Doom in general is just pulsing with atmosphere : from a listening perspective you can hear the monsters growling or the raspy sounds of the Imps down the hall which does mess with your head especially if they 're blindsiding you.Flickering lights , stumbling into a room that 's completely and full of monsters , or hitting a switch that unleashes a ton of monsters ... defend yourself or die ! The dark mood that Doom provides is very thick for early 90 's fare . *Some people think for an old game like this there 's lifeless brown or grey colored levels on flat land without even playing it ... not true.Pentagrams everywhere , corpses impaled , walls made from flesh , scrolling walls made from intestines.I think it 's the eighth level on Doom I you meet the barons of hell in the center a star-shaped room that 's like a temple most unexpectedly ... caught me completely off guard first time I ever played Doom and never forgot it.That 's one thing about the older Doom games , chockful of surprising moments ! *The enemies of Doom I were good but Doom II they just added more to the roster that were literally far tougher and could kill you quick if you were n't on your toes.Mass quantities of monsters coming at you at once as the Doom series I always found to possess the most intense battles you 'll come across on a FPS game.That 's not to call any of the newer games weak but by going 2D but ID Software was just able to dish out much more when it came to traps and high volume monster shooting.Conclusion : The controls were decently laid out , audio remastering did the trick , as far as I 'm concerned this the inquiry of 'if it 's as good or better than the PC version or not ' because it 's an obsolete game graphics wise.The framerate is pretty smooth to me and the graphics are spot on to me.A bad version of Doom was for the Sega 32X that was a very stripped down and clearly stuck out like a sore thumb to the PC version.The PS1 Version is an awesome alternative and is worth having ... .5-stars !	1
Jet Moto , Sony 's answer to Wave Race 64 , was an instant hit for Singletrac back in 1996 . Singletrac , best known for its ' Twisted Metal games , set out to make a futuristic racer in the vein of both Wave Race 64 and Wipeout and succeeded . Players control riders on hoverbikes which hover close to the ground and can be driven over land and water . The game utilizes a system called the Magnetic Grapple in which pressing an assigned button creates a magnetic attraction between the player 's bike and red energy poles that are placed throughout the courses . This enables the rider to swing around tight turns with his bike without slowing down . If done properly , it helps players cross gaps to large to get over as well as propelling riders out of turns alot faster than when going in . Chracters are split in teams with bikes adorned with logos of sponsors just like in real-life racing . 20 Characters and 3 tracks are available at the beginning , with seven more tracks unlockable by winning tournaments.Jet Moto is best known by fans for its ' suicide courses . Tracks have a point A and point B. Racers begin at point A racing to point B and back again , all the while facing other oncoming racers coming towards them . It 's also known for its ' somewhat outrageous track structure mixed in with traditional courses.I fondly remember setting up all night on the weekends with friends playing this game , just to see who had bragging rights when the night was over . Most of the time they 'd win but , every once in awhile , I would win . I 'll admit , it took alot to beat this game . I love this game and still play it to this day .	1
This game created a whole new race style . With the grapple system , it really was unique . The rider profiles and teams really made it cool . Brings back so many memories .	1
Me and my friends used to play this game non stop for hours at a time when it first came out . It was so addicting and so much fun playing with friends . You can even upgrade your bikes I think . Such a fun game .	1
Namco Museum 3 ( third in a series of five collections of old arcade hits ) hits some high and low spots , but is well worth the purchase price for three games . The best of the lot is the translation of Ms Pac-Man - very faithful to the original . Galaxian is highly addictive and equally faithful to the original . Most people do n't give Dig-Dug the credit it 's due - it is very entertaining - even for adults . I rather liked Dig-Dug in the arcades , and this is a good rendition . On the other hand , & quot ; Phozon & quot ; and & quot ; Tower of Druga & quot ; are very forgettable , & quot ; Tower & quot ; the most worthless of the lot . Still well worth buying just for the excellent Ms Pac Man .	1
Great game ! I have n't played the other ones yet , but I really like this one a lot ! You get Ms. Pac-Man , Dig-Dug , Galaxian , Phozon , and The Tower of Duraga . Dig-Dug is my favorite out of these and all are fun , but some can get a little boring after a while . The graphics for the psone look great and little to no lag . I really like the theater and the library that is in it too ! Overall , I really enjoyed this game and great for people who love arcade games ! Ca n't wait to get the other Volumes some time .	1
MS.PACMANGALAXIANPOLE POSITION 2DIGDUGPHOZONTOWER OF DRUAGA ( RETRACTION FROM MY REVIEW OF NAMCOMUSEUM VOL.1 : I somehow forgot that DIGDUG was included in VOL.3 , and erroneously entered it as included theirein . However , at 7 games , it is STILL the best value of the series . I now return you to your regularly scheduled game review , already in progress.. ) These games are of course perfectly emulated and a joy to play alone or with family.One thing I neglected to mention about the Pole Position titles in this volume and the first : If you play these games with the obscure Namco Playstation controller called the & # 34 ; NEGcon & # 34 ; You will have the ABSOLUTE BEST controls of the game , outside of maybe the arcade cabinets themselves . ( They may also support other racing wheel controllers . ) Great for the whole familyPlays on Playstation 1-3	1
This is a great `` Nastalgia '' gamer who knows how it all began when PAC-MAN was first played on the COMMODORE 64 , and AMIGA computers . Now today its even hotter then ever . New generations as well as old are at it again going Pac-wild with The whole Pac-Family games . I will never get tired of Pac-Man and Mrs. Pac-Man , and they are still hard and challenging as hell ! I remember playing Dig Dug on an old computer in my Support home work class back in Junior High in NYC , and today its still a collectors and a classic.A must buy Gem to keep forever for those who love these games and want to play them on the PSX . The playstation controller is great with PAC-MAN games as well as other games from all the namco Museum collection.Thanks for reading	1
it got here quick and was in great shape . would purchase from this company again . play great , my husband is testing out as we speak , thanks ! ! !	1
Mrs. Packman and Dig Dug are two of the best video games ever throw Pole Position in and this is a must have game it is especially fun at parties	1
Now u can have all of the classic games on ur ps1 . It has many things to do on it unstead of just playing the original arcade game . What u can do is walk around the museum and look at all of the game rooms or just explore and see what is there . Each room that u walk in that is a game has a really cool movie clip before u play them . There is this one room that tells u all of the info about games and when they came out and how popular they were . Which is awsome to learn about it . The graphics in the museum r great for the ps1 but when u play the arcade games they got changed from the original by a tiny bit and the music is more clear . It has many of the classics that u can play single or multiplayer on which is fun . When u get this game dont think all there is is the arcade games in it , there is much more than that . It is an awsome game .	1
I have been playing video games since pong ( the 70 's ) and I have change with the time ( bought a new system every year they come out ) and love some of the new play station games but it 's good to have some old favorites ! ! When I bought VOl 3 ( just for Mrs. Pac-man ) it was like WOW I forgot about pole position ( ya nothing like nascar 2002 ) , but that use to be my favorite when I was a kid & still is ! ! Funny thing is when I was 8yrs old I could never get past the 2nd screen in Galaxian Now 22 years later of playing video games , I still ca n't get past the 2nd screen even though I master Sypro ( a 2000 game ) in 2 days.I have to admit druaga & phozon were never favorites when I was kid but there hoot to play now just seeing those out of date graphics , yep the graphic may be pathetic & game idea may seem simple but they are still challenging and a good reminder of what the good old days of video games were like .	1
Namco Volume 3 is a well rounded collection of classic arcade favorites . It features Ms. Pacman , DigDug , Galaxian ( which became addictive very fast after a few plays . ) , also..features Pole Position II , Phozen ( which I had never heard of till this collection . It 's not for everyone . ) , and last but not least we have..The Tower of Druaga . Obviously the best games are Ms. Pacman , Galaxian , and DigDug which each of these games are worth having individually , so having them all on one disc it 's hard to go wrong . But wait there is one slight problem . When you go to the screen that allows you to change the dip switches..when they pop up they cover the menu and you do n't know what your changing until you get back to the game , only to realize you have unknowingly changed your amount of lives to 1 and set your bonus on 10000000 or something to that effect . Maybe it 's just me but I would have preferred a modern menu instead of the switches . Never~the~less 4 STARS .	1
This collection of games from Namco is a blast from the past for anyone who grew up playing video games at home on Atari or who spent their entire life savings at the arcades . The games included on this collection are : `` Ms. Pac Man '' , `` Dig Dug '' , `` Galaxion '' , `` Phozon '' , `` Pole Position II '' , and `` Tower Of Druaga '' . For those who do n't own a PS2 , NAMCO MUSEUM VOL . 3 is worth owning because of `` Ms. Pac Man '' , `` Dig Dug '' , and `` Galaxion '' . '' Ms . Pac Man '' is just as fun to play as the original `` Pac Man '' but is just slightly more difficult and gives a more continues the `` story '' begun in `` Pac Man '' . `` Dig Dug '' is one of the classic arcade games of the 80s . The game seems easy enough to play ( dig your way through dirt , kill monsters before they kill you , and collect vegetables ) . However , the game becomes increasingly difficult as you progress and before you know it your running away more than you are shooting at monsters because there 's just too many of them . `` Galaxion '' is another arcade classic . It takes the premise of `` Space Invaders '' one step further so that instead of defending a planetary base from destruction and invasion , you 're in space trying to destroy an enemy fleet before they blow you up . In `` Space Invaders '' you could hide your gun behind turrets , but there is no place to hide in `` Galaxion . `` The other three games on the collection are fairly forgettable and were somewhat obscure in the day . `` Phozon '' is a type of puzzle game where you try to match up the phozons with the pattern without getting blown to bits . `` Pole Position II '' is a racing game where you blow up if you get too far off course or run into items . In that sense its realistic . However , the game is extremely difficult to play because the analog component of the paddle is n't compatible and you do n't have a joystick so you 're forced to drive your car using the directional buttons . What a pain . `` Tower of Druaga '' is the final game on the collection . It involves trying to get Gil to climb through all the levels of the Tower . It 's kind of like an early video game version of role playing . It 's kind of interesting , but it takes an incredibly long amount of time to defeat.Overall , this is a great collection for anyone who grew up playing video games in the 80s . For those who are too young to remember Atari , the game is nice to play because of its retro and anything retro is cool .	1
I love this disc because it gives me the chance to play the old school games that I used to play .	1
This is one of the greatest games of all times . No if , ands , or buts . This is the granddaddy of them all when it comes to survival horror . Yes , Alone in the Dark , Uninvited and Sweet Home came first , but they went nowhere . This is what kick started an entire genre.I love this version of the game the best ( even more than that ReMake ) because it has 3 options for gameplay , original , beginner or arranged . Arranged is awesome as it `` arranges '' the locations of many items in the game . Much like the `` 2nd quest '' on the first Zelda game.The voice acting is legendary , the graphics just awesome and who can forget the live video at the beginning and ending of the game ! ( The girl who played Jill is absolutely beautiful . ) This game is hard . One bites puts you in orange caution if you 're Jill , on arranged anyway . Ammunition is VERY limited at the start of the game . But that 's what makes it so great . You ca n't run around blasting things . It 's just wonderful ! There are many easter eggs or `` little things '' to find out in this game . ( Look up a good walkthrough if you have trouble finding them . ) These give the game a good bit of replay value.I highly recommend this if you want a good game . In fact , they do n't get much better .	1
RE is a game that not only the first game that took more than an hour-and-a-half to beat , it was a revolution in video game playing . It was the first in it 's time . The first game to have actual 3-D characters , rather than the suposive 3-D design that `` Doom '' and `` Duke Nukem '' bragged about their choppy , cardboard design . Now that the movie of `` Resident Evil '' is out , kids and teenagers will be rushing out to buy the RE games . For an aparent reason , the original RE is n't being sold anymore , rather that it 's very , very rare and probably costs around 70 to 80 dollars . Instead , they 're is the Director 's Cut . The DC is a odd version of RE that most people will be mistaking by the name . No , it is n't more gorier , and no , Deleted Scenes not included ; seriously . Originally , the DC version had a much more explicit graphic beginning , with blood and all . But due to censorship and problems with young kids bying M-Rated games and watching R-Rated movies , the scenes were cut out . The only real different thing about the Director 's Cut is the different costumes availible and items are in different spots . This will leave already RE owners high and dry , while satisfying non-RE game owners . Anyways , the story.In RE , a group of Special tactics commandos , known as S.T.A.R.S . ( Special Tactics and Rescue Squad ) are dispacthed to a secluted mansion in the middle of a remote forrest . The mansion once harvested top secret government experiments , lead by a Evil Corporation known as `` Umbrella '' . After the first squad , Bravo Team , was shot down from their helicopter and diseapeared without communication . The second squad , Alpha Team , was sent to rescue them . But a few scuffles with unknown creatures , leads their helicopter leaving them in the middle of the forrest . In panic , the team finds refuge in the mansion . But little does the team know is that their troubles just begun . You have the choice to either play Chris Redfield , a ex-marine turned SWAT commander , or Jill Valentine , a strong guided commando with the ability to pick lock doors and locks . Through out the game , you must survive in the mansion . Your enemies are Bio-infested Zombies ... .that 's right , zombies . The problem ; you 're running low on ammo . The story goes together , much like the basis for Sam Raimi 's `` Evil Dead II : Dead by Dawn '' or George Romeo 's `` Night of the living Dead '' . Complete with FMV cut-scenes , that include , no less , Screen Actor Guild rejected actors with terrible acting and bad dialouge ( `` You almost turned into a Jill-sandwich ! ! ! `` ) , but never the less still a fun game . Must buy	1
All I can say about this one is that it 's just about as good as the other ones , just has ... dialogue and voice acting , and no real cut scenes .	1
we have always been a fan of all the resident evil games we all love to play them and was very happy that the game was in great shape and that we got it fast when we ordered it	1
The original Resident Evil changed the game industry forever . Although the Survival Horror genre is certainly old , being Interplay 's & quot ; Alone in the Dark & quot ; the first example to come to my mind , RE sent the genre and the video game industry where it had never before ventured.The idea , simple as it sounds , harbors with it the strength to create a fine video game experience : Lock yourself at a mansion filled with zombies and other creatures plus limited ammo , and try to get yourself out of this.This is the only game of the series that is worth of any praise , not only because it did much for the industry , but because of its game play value .	1
... Resident Evil : Directors Cut is a enigma in itself . Now why do I say that ? Well basically this is not a Directors Cut because capcom messed up . The only people who officially got a Director 's cut is Japan and thier initial release of Biohazard ( Resident Evil in Japan ) . What we are missing is actually about 14 seconds in 2 different videos you see thru the game . In the opening video , 10 seconds is missing which actually makes the video more graphic when Joseph dies by one of the zombies dog 's and some of the characters are smoking . In the second video where you meet your first zombie , you see a more graphic depiction of the zombie eating Kenneth . But is it really worth it ? Most Gamers do n't even know about it much less care , but collectors and true fanatics are really steamed about it.The STORY is very well done I can say . Even though it does not really keep pace within the game , it is very interesting and revives a cult classic monster ... .zombies ! Vicious murders have plauged the town of Racoon City and it is up to the S.T.A.R.S ( Special Tactics and Rescue Squad ) to find out where the source of these murders are coming from . You take on the role as Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine and attempt to investigate a house infested with things that go bump in the night . Get ready to immerse yourself in the game that started the genre - Survival Horror.The GAMEPLAY is what to can be expected from a game like this . You will be jumping and many scenes in this game for it will spook the life out of you . I know you are saying ... this is just a game ... .its more than that , trust me . You basically navigate your character throughout the game solving various puzzles to gain access to different areas . You will find plenty of ammo and weapons to help you battle the many monsters you will come up against . Other S.T.A.R.S member will be around to help you out ... .others will try to block your way . Although the controls are very hard to get used to , eventually you can compensate in many situations . You will battle zombies , dogs , crows and the dreaded M-121A 's ... .the Hunters . But do n't think you wo n't have the weapons to defend yourself for you will be armed with 9mm , shotgun 's , a Colt Pyton and a fantastic Missle Launcher.The GRAPHICS are what to be expected for this game . I personally saw no problem with the graphics . Many people complain about the camera angles , but to me the camera angles added more spook to the game . The Hunters still looked scary as heck with the limited graphics . Many of the cutscenes are shown within the game engine , but the opening and ending actually have real actors . Yes the dialouge is cheezy , but what do you expect ? Overall I really enjoyed this game even though it took me a long time to get around to playing it . I still can not get over how much Wesker in the opening movie looks like Val Kilmer from Top Gun . It had me jumping in a lot of areas and the puzzles were not too difficult . A great game and a great buy .	1
This Director 's Cut is the only version of this game you should own , simply because it supports the Analogue joysticks on the Playstation controller . The control in the other versions is impossible at times , and a bugger to learn if you are a first time player.The game by itself is excellent . Lot 's of puzzles , and lots of Zombies to shoot down . There are times ( many of them , actually ) where you much be careful how many zombies you shoot , because you can run low on bullets very quickly . The story is standard for any Survival Horror game : A group of soldiers are locked in an old mansion that is infested with zombies . An evil company has eperimented with a chemical that turns people into zombies , and the fallout turns the WHOLE TOWN into zombies . To survive , you must make your way through the mansion , and solve all the puzzles . This is definitely a challenge , and one that can be frustrating at times , but rewarding once completed.Here are the pros . The graphics are superb . The detailing of the zombies and the surroundings give you are real sense of dread , and yes , the blood flow is well detailed , it sprays when you are wounded . The music is ominous and ambient , giving just the right mood to the situations you come across . The story is also well put together , even though anyone who has seen George Romero 's `` Living Dead '' trilogy ( and what horror fan has n't ? ) can get a sense of deja vu . All these elements make this a game well worth getting.Now for the cons . This game is not the toughest game for the Playstation , but it can be darn frustrating when you get stuck . Sometimes , a puzzle is very tricky and requires you to back-track just to see if you missed anything . This adds much more time to the game , but not in a good way . There is also the frustration of running low on bullets when there are three zombies coming towards you . Each zombie requires about three bullets each to finish them off , but bullets are so scarce that you must conserve . Also , the acting and dialogue is so hammy that it is comical , and you feel compelled to just skip through it so you can get back to killing zombies.Overall , this is a great game with a few shortcomings . But then again , nothing is perfect . If the Survival Horror concept sounds appealing , then you should check this one out . The `` Resident Evil '' series has become the benchmark of Survival Horror much like `` Final Fantasy '' has for the RPG genre .	1
Even with the advent of the PS2/3 , the original `` Resident Evil '' still holds its water against the modern era of video games . It set the standard for `` survival horror '' in video games . It frightens and delights . The controls take a little to get down , and the intensity and urgency of the game demand that you get those under control or be eaten.The game takes time and is recommended for those that can devote 30min-1hour a day to the game.A must for any game who claims to be a fan of the zombie genre .	1
Nowadays , blowing zombies up is as commonplace as a 2D fighter that houses a character that can throw a fireball . From the & quot ; House Of The Dead & quot ; series to & quot ; Silent Hill & quot ; , everyone has ripped off Capcom 's masterpiece . The story starts off in a city us hardcore gamers will all know , Raccoon City . On a hill in an out-of-the-way area lies a mansion that holds a deadly secret . Down in Raccoon City , the community has had violent attacks by zombies that are bumpig off the townspeople . The R.P.D . send out their S.T.A.R.S . unit to find out what 's up with this mansion and it 's 'monsters ' . Both the Alpha and Omega teams shall never be the same ... ... . What you encounter through this tale of death is nothing short of terror perfetion . From your first encounter with dogs , to your first boss , to your return to the mansion only to find your zombie pals have been replaced with gremlins from hell called hunters ; this is horror-gaming nirvana . Your characters are Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield . You get to pick which character you lead ( or lead you ) down your path of hell . Jill is the easier one to use , while Chris is the harder one . For example , Jill starts off with a pistol , while Chris starts off with the forever dreaded knife . Basically their stories are the same with some different twists thrown in here and there . For example , Jill 's sidekick is Barry , while Chris gets Rebecca . Throughout your journey , you pick up on clues as to what 's going on . Such as diary entries . You come across the mansion twice , a backhouse , a garden , an underground passage way , and an underground laboratory throughout your story . All the while you hear the name of a corporation ( one that will haunt you throughout the series ) known as Umbrella . The game is n't hard , but it is n't easy either . Worrying about ammo and herbs is always the number one priority . Playing through the game to see what 's ahead ( you know , horse around ) , then go out for real and work your way through the story is the biggest tip I can give . And always save ( just do n't over do the ink ribbons , there 's only so many ) . The graphics were breathtaking then and still hold up today . The control is difficult for some to get used to , but I never had a problem with it . The sound is also amazing , but quite important . Usually when I play games , I put on my headphones ( Nine Inch Nails for me ) and play away . Unfortunately , I ca n't do this . You need the sound to hear what 's going on , whether it 's zombies that are lurking around a corner you ca n't see , or something following you , you have to listen . This adds to the gaming element immensely . It 'll often scare you , but that 's the point , adding a new gaming dimension . One of fear . My only problem with the game , is the story of who originally owned the mansion . ... Ultimately , Capcom scratched all that . And it detracts from it all as the story behind the mansion has too many holes . In the end though , this was a classic video game . Not the best Resident Evil , but mandatory if you intend to play them all as the story is missing a lot if you pick up on the series when it 's already told so much . It 's graphic , it 's bloody , it 's epic , it 's scary and it 's an experience you wo n't soon forget . Just do n't play with the lights off , you 'll never sleep again .	1
Resident Evil , THE survival horror series that that has became so popular and spawned many sequels.Gameplay:9.5/10 : It 's a survival horror game ! In a mansion , filled with zombies , limited ammo and saves spots , limited healing , and puzzles . What 's there not to like ? You can even blow zombie 's heads off with a shotgun ! You can pick two players , Jill Valentine , and Chris Redfield . Both are different , and you should play as Jill first , than Chris.You also get three difficulty levels in the DC version , easy , normal , and Arrange . Arrange is hard , with new costumes , puzzles , and camera angles.Graphics : 1996 : 10/10 : 2005:4/10 : Pretty bad by today 's standards , but back then it was great , and the FMV 's have real people in it ! Music/sound:8/10 : Horror-like music and soundsDialogue:3/10 : Very corny . From Wesker 's `` Stay alert '' and `` Do n't open that door ! ! `` , to Barry 's `` I hope this is not Chris 's blood ! `` , the dialogue and tone is CHEESEY ! But , it was made by Japanese actors , so it 's easy to understand why.Overall , it 's a must have ! Get the other RE games , too !	1
Capcom 's legendary Resident Evil series and I have never really seen eye to eye . Though I own nearly every non-GameCube title in the undead thriller 's history , I 'd never been able to stand one long enough to actually complete it , right up until this past week . I 'd always found the series to be misleading , disguising itself as a straightforward action title before slowing the gameplay down to a crawl and relying on endless puzzles and feats of memory to lengthen completion times . Time after time , I 'd sit down with the goal of finally tackling these games , and time after time I 'd get bored , stuck or distracted , leaving the game behind . I grabbed Resident Evil 3 when it was relatively new , and the title has sat , unplayed , on my shelf for years . That was , as I said , until this past week , when I sat down with renewed vigor and vowed to complete the first title in the series , even if it drove me to madness.I 'll make it really blunt ; the story is absolutely terrible . The uninspiring characters meander their way through the events without a care in the world , occasionally encountering plot holes large enough to drive an oversized bus through . Nagging issues , such as why somebody would lock their home 's single shotgun away in a room that 's only accessible through a string of unrelated tricks and puzzles , are n't even touched upon . What if somebody breaks in , in the middle of the night ? Is the owner of the mansion really going to have time to roll out of bed , run downstairs , jog to one side of the house , move around a couple statues , grab a key , run to another corner of the house , open a door , grab a fake shotgun , return to the original side of the house , unlock the doors and replace the `` real '' shotgun with the fake ? I suppose the story does the right thing by failing to even mention these things , but they 'll still tug away at the back of your mind as you play.The graphics of the first Resident Evil really have n't aged well . Humans and zombies alike wander around stiffly and unrealistically , each one looking almost identical to the others . Polygon models are simple and blocky . Textures are pixelated and undetailed , looking more like a game assembled on the Super Nintendo 's SuperFX chip than a PlayStation title . The series ' characteristic pre-rendered backgrounds are poorly compressed and difficult to navigate in places , forcing players to turn out all the lights and squint their eyes just to make their way through the room . Merging still images with live polygons , Resident Evil plays like a strange amalgamation of the PC classics `` Myst '' and `` Alone in the Dark . `` The bread and butter of any console title , its gameplay , is the one area where you 'll really learn to love or hate this series . Rather than bothering with camera angles and awkward environments , Capcom has instead sent players through a series of screens , occasionally containing interactive elements of their own . You 'll control Jill or Chris from a series of dramatic angles , never in control of the camera itself . They 'll enter a screen on the left side , mosey around a little bit , kill a couple zombies and leave the screen on the right side , immediately entering the next screen from another direction . Though it was a somewhat novel concept at the time of its release , this scheme brought with it numerous problems , the most notable of which was your interaction with enemies on the next screen . It 's not uncommon to run full throttle off the edge of one screen , only to find a zombie waiting for you right at the edge of the next . It 's a really cheap way to take a hit , and can mean a speedy , frustrating death in later stages.Looking back , the control scheme employed here is notably revolutionary . Rather than applying a more traditional platformer 's control layout , Resident Evil introduced gamers to a stationary rotation-based configuration . Left and right do n't serve to strafe , they stop the character 's movement altogether and rotate them left or right in place . Up moves you forward , and down moves backwards . Pressing R1 draws your weapon , and pressing X at the same time fires . It 's a scheme that 's more appropriate for the kind of stationary gunfighting and marksmanship that 's defined the action portions of this series since day one.Many of the tricks and puzzles buried within the mansion are n't so much brain teasers as they are time wasters . You 'll realize what needs to be done within moments , but chances are good you wo n't have the piece needed to do so on your person . It took me about six and a half hours to beat the game for the first time as Chris , cautiously walking around , learning the position of the zombies , figuring out the puzzles , groaning as I realized the piece I needed was sitting in a chest , fifteen minutes away , and repeating that process . The second time through , playing as Jill and remembering which random item I would need where , I finished in three hours and twenty minutes . That 's one heck of a variation.The soundtrack to the first Resident Evil is really something that 's difficult to categorize . Imagine , if you can , a blend of symphonic suspense , the song that plays when you push `` demo '' on a keyboard , and elevator music . That 's Resident Evil 's melody . The composer tried to capitalize on the few `` jump out of your seat '' moments the storyline provided , but surrounded by cheesy samples , monotonously repeating tunes and quality that sounds more like something on the N64 than the PSX , there was only so much that could be done.On the large , this was a different kind of game than what we were getting at the time , something fresh . It was n't a blockbuster , oh-my-god-get-me-the-sequel-now , mind numbing experience . I can understand why a game like this would deserve a sequel , but even today I could n't have predicted the amount of games it would spawn .	1
This was the first RE game I ever played and it got me hooked on the RE series . After playing this I got all the other RE games ASAP ! ! ! This is a great game , the graphics are good for a PS1 game , and I really liked the action , the puzzles , and the plot . This is an essential for anybody interested in RE and the whole zombie deal : ) Buy this game and you will not be let down.bryanreo @ sbcglobal.net	1
Resident Evil is a survival horror video game created by Capcom . It was released in Japan , North America , and Europe in 1996.In the game , you play as either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine , two S.T.A.R.S officers who become trapped in a mansion filled with zombies . You must go through the mansion and find clues , weapons , and other items in order to proceed . You fight many different types of zombies throughout the game . Some of the supporting characters include Rebecca Chambers , Barry Burton , and Albert Wesker . The game also has different endings depending on what you do.This is a classic survival horror game . It 's so good and well made . If you love horror movies , or other horror games , then I totally recommend that you play Resident Evil .	1
Even now , I still love playing this 7 year old game on my PS2 . It opened the door to greater things . The resident evil series is my favorite video game line ever .	1
this puts the most recent code veronica x to shame . it has the best story and best scare factor . sure , the graphics may lack a little , but its the original , first of its kind . i recommend playing this game before playing any more re titles so the stories actually make sense .	1
Since last night I 've been waiting to do this review , because I 've been studying the exact differences from RE2 and RE Directors Cut . This review will really help for someone who has played RE2 but is wondering what RE DC is about . Well , you 've came to the right place . First of all , here are the facts:1 . Each zombie takes 5 shots NO MATTER WHAT . ( with the Beretta ) 2 . Jill is a blonde all though she does n't look like it ( a very dumb blonde ) 3 . BARRY HAS A MAGNUM AND HES PROUD ! ! ! 4 . You have to kill zombies up to four times if you leave the room when you shoot them down . ( that means they come back alive once they are dead and you leave the room ... the just pop up ! ) 5 . This game has hilarious dialogue ! Well , speaking of dialogue , the grammar is also very bad ... and I mean VERY bad . Examples are : ( when you pick up the 1st floor map ) & quot ; You got the 1st floor map & quot ; RE2 says & quot ; you 've taken the 1st floor map & quot ; that makes more sense . & quot ; You got the acid rounds & quot ; ... funny sometimes . Also , what I found is that Jill does n't know what blood is . Barry is inspecting a pool of red liquid on the dining room floor . Jill comes over and has the nerve to ask & quot ; What is it ? & quot ; and she stays there and studies it ... ? ? ? Barry replies with & quot ; I THINK it is blood . I hope this is not Chris 's blood ! & quot ; And they have exaggeration at the completely wrong times . But when there is a big monster coming they just talk & quot ; wow . its a monster . what do we do ? & quot ; and when there is like a door that doesnt open ( during movie scenes ) they say & quot ; THIS DOOR WONT OPEN ! ! WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ? ? & quot ; Also , a really hilarious part is when Barry hands Jill the acid rounds Jill says that he should keep them for himself , and Barry replies & quot ; No that 's okay ... I have THIS ! ! ! & quot ; And holds up his Magnum ... I laughed my head off ... he sounded so stupid ! No offence to the makers of RE or anything but it is just so funny ! Another fact is that the camera angles are bad , but the puzzles are harder . Hmmm ? Resident Evil is a very very very good game ... but it is just the dialogue and camera angles ... ive been talking it down but now its time to tell you that it is DEFINATELY worth getting , despite it 's happy mediums.So theres a few final things I have to say here:1 . Barry has a magnum 2 . Wesker has shades 3 . And the three zombies at the top of the stairs above the M Storeroom 1F sound like cows.Cheers ! ~Jongles	1
This is the one that started it all folks ! this is about mysterious murders in Raccoon city involving cannibalism , a group of special police officers called `` S.T.A.R.S . '' go outside the city to find the murderers but when their Helicopter with pilot leaves them behind , they seek shelter in a large mansion but unknown to them that the mansion is also a death trap with hordes of Zombies , giant tarantulas , monster dogs and mutant creatures waiting for them , will they make it out alive ? A brilliant and highly original game using elements of Lucio Fulci , George Romero , Dario Argento , horror and science ficiton with clues , gore , cool monsters , puzzles and knowing how to survive which makes this a one-of-a-kind game for every game player . I 've became a fan of this since 1996 , it 's the best game i 've ever played with the entire series too .	1
If only the movie was as good . I 've missed playing this game so much , glad to have it back in my collection .	1
The original Resident Evil is the purest example of a survival horror video game . The newer RE iterations , while fun in their own right , are not survival , and some would say not even horror video games.Resident Evil throws the player into an old , dilapidated mansion with the vaguest notion of zombies on the prowl . The original party is split up to investigate the area , and the player is left to find clues towards a path to safety.Unlike many games supposedly within the Survival Horror genre , Resident Evil hits the nail on the head with the notions of staying safe . Enemies are best avoided , as direct combat can result in being quickly overcome with zombies or being poisoned.Items are hidden throughout the mansion that detail just how the monstrous zombie outbreak started , and to a lesser extent details the lives of the individuals who lived there during the initial stages of the outbreak . There are pictures of their families and friends , their clothes tucked into their closets , and , on occasion , the zombified individual himself , trapped and desolate in a bathtub or a wing of his home.Playing the game , one truly gets a sense of being stranded . In essence , it puts the player in the perspective of every human being there during the outbreak . You never know who or what has been turned , nor where those beings now dwell . Caution is the only priority , and this game capitalizes on that.Weapons are not found sitting out for any person to find . The player must actively search for items to aid in his or her quest . Guns are definitely there , but they would be about as well-hidden as a person living inside the mansion would have them . The control scheme may seem archaic now , but for the genre , the controls are spot on . Maneuvering through a hallway full of zombies should not be an easy task , and given the options presented , it really isn't.Puzzles are a central ( albeit quizzical ) part of Resident Evil 's gameplay . In keeping with the survival elements , some doors are locked ; to pass through them , the player must find the key . This involves searching room-to-room around the mansion , and solving the occasional puzzle . These elements are definitely well-aligned with the gameplay , but from a strictly survival perspective , some puzzles fit the scheme better than others.The plot is weaved strongly through the course of the game . Many of your allies are found dead throughout the mission , consumed by the horrors of the mansion . Others are as desperate as ever to get out , while some are a bit too satisfied hanging around . The plot is advanced mostly through cut-scenes where characters interact with each other . The voices , as all know , are pretty hilarious ( or bad , depending on your perspective ) . For the time , characters using voice-overs as opposed to text was revolutionary . Unfortunately , the voice acting did n't stand the test of time , and some of the more hilarious quips are almost inside-jokes among video game fans.The graphics were definitely of the era . In 1996 , this game 's graphics would astound any who saw it . Twelve years later , they are clearly dated . Many games of this era ca n't stand the test of time ( strangely , games of the 16-bit era age more much gracefully , and even modern games have become throwbacks to the visuals of that time period ) , but Resident Evil fares better than many Playstation titles . Many of the pre-rendered backgrounds are highly detailed and set the mood wonderfully . Given the polygon count of the day , its pretty easy to tell where your character stands against the backdrop , and conversely , where the enemy stands . Thankfully , the color schemes applied to enemy and ally serve to blend objects and backgrounds together seamlessly.The sound is more forgettable than anything in this game . The soundtrack does serve its duty well in creating and maintaining a frightening atmosphere , but there 's just not anything noteworthy enough to stick out after over a decade . The sound effects , while not fantastic , serve their purposes extremely well . Given the player 's mood , one would still be prone to jump when a noise is heard off-screen.With a game as old as this one is , it would be easy to find faults -- especially comparing those faults with current-gen gameplay mechanics and graphics . However , if one can allow themselves to enter the early PSX era , the true beauty of a game like Resident Evil can shine through . While not perfect , this game serves as the ultimate example of what survival horror is . RE set the stage for things to come , and its great to be able to go back and see the humble beginnings of some of the greatest plot elements and gameplay mechanics we enjoy in video games today .	1
Resident Evil : Director 's Cut ( 1997 ) . The PSX re-release of the 1996 survival horror game.Back when the PSX was first released , the system did n't have much in the way of standout games . Of course , there were a few noteworthy PSX launch games like Twisted Metal , Doom , and Tekken , but for the most part , the PSX did n't have anything outstanding yet . Thus , Resident Evil was made . Taking influences from the earlier survival horror series Alone In The Dark , Resident evil took all of its aspects to the next level and eventually became one of Capcom 's most successful franchises to date , ranking just behind the Mega Man and Street Fighter games . In fact , the original RE game was probably the first PSX game to make the system worthwhile before other important games were released in the following years.Most everyone who 's played the games already knows the story , but for those who have n't , here 's a brief synopsis : A strange murder occurrence just outside of Raccoon City has caused Police officials to be suspicious , so they sent two Special Tactics and Rescue Squad ( STARS ) teams to go investigate . You play as either Jill Valentine or Chris Redfield , both of them surviving STARS members . The teams end up getting stuck in the mountains , so they eventually find themselves inside a huge mansion , where the STARS members discover numerous creatures such as zombies , mutilated dogs , giant spiders , and other monsters . These were all created due to Umbrella Corporation 's disastrous T-Virus . As the game goes along , more important discoveries are made.Now let 's talk about the game itself.Of the three PSX RE games , this one easily has the worst graphics . We 're talking first-generation PSX graphics here , if that 's any indication . The character models are all blocky and easily stick out from the otherwise highly detailed still-screen environments . These environments are navigatably 3D , but the camera angles sit at fixed 2D points , which can be both good and bad , depending on the situation . By bad , I mean that some angles hinder the view of the action . The monsters ( especially the zombies ) have very limited animation and models compared to the later games , and its limited engine prevents the game from having more than 3 monsters on the screen at one time ( not including the crows ) . So the only real decent graphical aspects are the rendered environments . But even they do n't quite compare to the detail in the following games.The sound effects are good for the most part . However , the zombies come off sounding more like moaning old men than actual monsters , and the voice acting ... dear god ? do n't get me started . It 's so hilariously bad that it 's just fun to listen to . The dialogue does n't help things at all along with the horrible acting which is bad even by B-movie standards . One of my friends almost died of laughter the last time I went through the game . The music on the other hand , is decent and suits the mood of each area appropriately . It 's nothing special , but it does add to the overall suspense.The controls are something that most people either love or hate . It took me some time to get used to them , but now I have no troubles whatsoever . Most people that hate them do n't seem to realize that RE is n't just an all-out action game , but rather an exploration puzzle type game with action segments . The controls were a bit rough here , though they have been more refined in later releases . I do admit though , that it does get very tedious backtracking to the item box again and again because you ca n't hold all the items you want to . Between the two playable characters Jill and Chris , I personally found Jill to be the better one to control because she has more inventory slots and weapons than Chris , although Chris 's voice acting is n't quite as nerve-grating as hers is . Both characters each have their own sub-character that helps them along game , such as Barry who helps Jill , and Rebecca who aids Chris.Most people have said that this game was the scariest of all the RE games . I 'm not sure I agree with that , but the atmosphere can be quite chilling at certain points . I suppose that the dogs breaking through the glass windows could 've scared newbees to the series , but since I was introduced through RE2 and the fact that I 've already played the MUCH freakier Silent Hill games , the original did n't scare me nearly as much as it should have . To the game 's credit though , it does present the most puzzles , and a majority of them are real brain-benders . It 's something that the series started to get away from as time went on . Plus , I thought that the game itself felt larger than all the others in the series , so it will take a while for new players to beat it . The challenge is also very high since there is very limited ammo to take out the creatures with . Even veteran RE fanatics still find the first game to be thoroughly challenging enough to come back for more.This version of the game is a director ? s cut edition , but it ? s really nothing special . All we get is an extra mode that is more challenging and features different outfits for the main characters , but if you already own the original , there ? s no need to get this version . Apparently the Japanese version also had extra cut-scenes , so we were cheated ! So much for it being a ? director ? s cut ? , huh ? Although this game is extremely dated by today 's standards , it 's still worth checking out if you 're a big fan of the series and want to see how the series got started in the first place . However , it 's not really necessary now that a MUCH better remake is available on the Gamecube , so I suggest looking into that game instead . RECOMMENDED SPECIFICALLY TO FANS OF THE SERIES . NEW FANS SHOULD START WITH RE 2 OR THE GAMECUBE REMAKE OF THE ORIGINAL FIRST .	1
I thoroughly enjoyed this game . It is endless action in this horror survival game , but also puzzle solving , which makes it and intense and fun game . Of course killing zombies never gets old . There are also several versions of the game on this disc so if you want to play it over again you can do so with a slightly different version between the two main characters or the original version or directors cut version . This gives you four options .	1
Resident Evil : Director 's Cut , The Best Classic Survival Game ever . The Granddaddy of Survival Horror . This simple put is the Game ever the one that started it all in Survival Horror.The bit of Acting is a bit cheesey but once you get past that . you in a Mansion full of Zombies , Muntant Dogs , Lickers . snakes and mutant plants around every corner as you explore the Mansion and solve puzzles . it has some scary tone and music in the back ground and if your not fighting for your life your running from things as you try and solve the mystery of your missing team and the dissapperance of the first team that you came in search for.I highly recommend this game for anyone who loves Zombies and into survival horror .	1
I got this game at a video store recently , and they sell it for only $ 10.00 , so I snatched it , thinking it was gon na be good . And then it was ! GAMEPLAY : 10/10 Awesome ! you 're in a mansion with zombies and lots of monters ( literally ) and you 've got a lot of weapons ! GRAPHICS : 100/10 : The graphics add to the scares . and plus , Jill has a nice ass.Dialouge : .5/10 HORRIBLE ! From Wesker 's `` Stay alert '' and `` GET AWAY FROM HIM ! HE 'S INSANE ! '' To Barry 's `` What IS this ? '' amd `` Well , Let 's hope this is n't Chris 's blood ! `` ENTERTAINMENT VALUE : 9/10 It 's awesome ! So go buy this today !	1
WHEN I FIRST GOT MY PLAYSTATION , THIS WAS THE FIRST GAME I GOT . IT IS AND WILL ALWAYS BE A COOL GAME TO PLAY . BESIDES THE CHEESY VOICE ACTING , OR SO SO GRAPHICS - IT IS STILL A GEM OF A CLASSIC ! WHY ELSE WOULD CAPCOM REDO THE FIRST ONE FOR GAMECUBE ? AS WELL AS DO 2 MORE GAMES FOR GAMECUBE , AND DO A MOVIE ON IT ? BECAUSE IT IS- AND ALWAYS WILL BE THE COOLEST ZOMBIE GAME EVER ! ... AND NOT ONE YOU COULD EASILY CHEAT ON EITHER , UNLESS YOU GOT A GAMESHARK ... BECAUSE USING THE GUIDE IS NOT CHEATING ! YOU STILL HAVE TO BEAT THE GAME AND POSSESS SOME SKILL AND PATIENCE TO PLAY IT . '' RESIDENT EVIL 2 `` WAS GREAT ! AND NEMESIS EVEN BETTER ! AND LET 'S NOT FORGET `` CODE VERONICA `` EITHER ! ! HOPEFULLY A FEW NEW ONES WILL BE PUT OUT FOR PS2 OWNERS AS WELL .WHY SHOULD GAMECUBE OWNERS GET ALL THE FUN ! SO I HOPE YOU GO OUT AND GET IT . THIS IS ONE GAME YOU CAN LITERALLY PLAY TO DEATH ! ... IF YOU GET A GAMECUBE THAN GET THE NEW AND IMPROVED `` RESIDENT EVIL `` ! ! AND ALL THE OTHER ONES OUT NOW OR SOON TO BE OUT .. ANYONE CARE FOR A GAME OF KILLING ZOMBIES TONITE ?	1
This brought back so many memories . The godfather of all games . This is a must have for any avid game collector .	1
I played this on my PS1 shortly after it came out and really enjoyed it . The games graphics , use of pre-rendered backgrounds and creephy atmosphere were far superior to other such games and made for an unforgettable experience . Unfortunately the game has n't aged well especially the graphics . They 're low resolution and blocky when compared to today 's and can make revisiting the game a less than stellar experience . If you 're considering playing this I strongly recommend you consider playing the RESIDENT EVIL REMAKE instead . It 's far superior to the original in every way possible . If you really want to play the original game than by all means do so but I found it difficult revisiting it after playing the superior remake .	1
I purchased this version on my PlayStation 1 . This updated version was released a year and a half after the original game 's release . Director 's Cut was produced to compensate for the delay of the sequel , Resident Evil 2 , and was originally bundled with a playable demo of that game.The main addition to Director 's Cut is an `` arranged '' version of the game that changes the location of nearly every vital item in the mansion , as well as the enemy placement . The main characters , as well as Rebecca , are given a new wardrobe and the player 's handgun is replaced by an improved model where any shot fired has a random chance of decapitating a zombie , killing it instantly . The original version of the game is included as well , along with a new `` beginner '' mode where the enemies are easier to kill and the amount of ammunition that can be found by the player is doubled . Additionally , the auto-aim function was restored in all modes , though it is not noted in the in-game controls so the player must accidentally stumble upon it.I recommend all RE fans to get this version .	1
the one that started it all i have it and you should to i will in detail say the pros and cons of the game.the pros are great story , great puzzles , the suspense is great as well as the monsters that are in it over all it draws you in the world of the resident evil.the cons to much back and forth in the game , bazooka wont blow open doors , the other issue is if played on the ps2 you have to get used to the original controls again im used to ps2 games now guess im spoiled lol where you use the analog sticks to move and look around.over all great game turn out the lights put it in and put yourself in the game and have fun .	1
This is where the epic Resident Evil series began . The first adventure see 's you tackle zombies , snakes and dogs in a deserted mansion , which is very atmospheric . Do n't be put off by the relatively poor voice acting and cut scenes , bear in mind that this was made in 1995/1996 and so for the times it 's pretty good . This is a classic game that spawned one of the best series ' of games on the Playstation . The only thing preventing this from being a 5 star game is the slighty disapointing ending . But this is only a minor flaw , and this is still one of the best games on the Playstation .	1
THis is the amazing game that started the genre of & quot ; survival horror & quot ; and created the interest in fans for such games . This game is pretty old now , but if you have n't played it yet you 'll surely want to give it a try . The point to this game is simple : survive a mansion full of zombies , while solving puzzles along the way . What makes this game a challenge is the fact that you have to fend off enimies with a very limited amount of health and life . ANother challenge is that occasionally enimies will pop out and give you a surprise which you must quickly defend against . ANother great thing is that on this version of the game you get a special edition of Resident Evil and a harder difficulty level .	1
have not played yet but looks all good to me . I will be playing it tonight . A must for those interested in resident evil .	1
When you ask someone why the Sega Saturn failed and why the Sony Playstation succeeded , most people knowledgeable on the subject do n't have a great reason . The best answer I 've come up with is that Sony Playstation had some smash hits that the Saturn did not have . Games like Tomb Raider , Twisted Metal , and Final Fantasy VII were mega-hits that Saturn did not have an answer for . One game came very early into the Playstation library and was deemed an instant classic by gamers and critics alike , and that game is the first Resident Evil game , the first true hit for the Sony Playstation.Released by Capcom in early 1996 , Resident Evil was unlike any game we had ever seen at the time . With an opening title screen that explodes in blood and symbolizes terror , Resident Evil is a game that truly does n't reveal itself right away . You have the opening story cinema scenes that vaguely explain your elite police officers ' reason for venturing out into strange territory in search of your teammates . One of your teammates is killed during the investigation of the crashed helicopter by a strange canine beast of sorts , so the actors run for shelter in a spooky looking mansion.I wo n't rehash everything about the game , but I believe it is important to try and recapture the feeling of the first time playing the game . It 's pretty difficult to describe . The music is perfectly eery and sets the tone grandly with stringed arrangements you would hear in a suspenseful terror film . You walk around trying to find clues about what is going on in this strange mansion . Bizarre zombie creatures roam around desperately seeking to sink their teeth into your fresh blood , you try and find better guns to deal with these creatures , and you also try and find the keys to unlock the doors without knowing what terror lurks on the other side . On top of that , the seemingly haunted mansion has traps and strange puzzles that must be solved in order to continue finding your way closer to the end of the game , almost like a spooky mansion in a murder mystery . Horribly mutated dogs crash through windows when you least expect it , and the ammunition in the game is in a very limited supply , so you are forced to make snap decisions whether to stand and fight or run for safety . Scattered throughout the game are personal correspondence , diaries , and logs that reading will give you a clue to the ultimate mystery surrounding what the hell is going on.Before this game , the story regarding Umbrella did n't exist . Ironically , this kind of makes the game more mysterious . In other games , we already know about the Umbrella corporation 's role in the story , so this game is a unique experience of unraveling the truth . On top of that , this game takes place in the Spencer Estate Mansion , which is the perfect terrifying setting for this unique gaming experience . There 's nothing wrong with the second and third games taking place in a Precinct , but a haunted mansion crawling with the undead is just perfect.Chris and Jill are the playable characters , both with their strengths and weaknesses . Honestly , Jill 's game is much easier . She gets the bazooka , which Chris does not , and is given the lockpick at the start of the game in place of having to find the Sword Key . Jill also has 8 inventory slots to Chris ' paltry six , and because Chris has no lockpick , he has to find small keys to open the locked drawers for ammunition . Having a small key clogging one of Chris ' six inventory slots is quite a nuissance , especially since Jill does not even have to bother wasting one of her eight inventory slots with the lockpick . Finally , the obvious reason for Jill 's easier game is in her companion , Barry Burton . Barry is very helpful and will heal Jill from a giant poisonous snake , give her acid rounds for the bazooka , help her to get the shotgun and will even torch the massive Plant 42 for her , while Chris is forced to rely on the inexperienced Rebecca to learn to play piano , find serum for him , and mix up a potion to injure Plant 42 . There are ways to alter Rebecca 's actions to make her a bit more useful , but in the end her assistance is not as valuable as Barry's.Today , the polygon graphics that were so compelling during this age of gaming do look substantially dated , and the voice acting , which was considered atrocious even when the game was new , is laughably absurd . But who could n't use a laugh after the horrors and suspense of playing this game ? We all know the storyline of the game , and most of us remember all the thrilling moments to the point where they have lost their sharpness over the years . But take yourself back in time for a minute and try to remember what this game felt like to you the very first time you played it when you were much younger , and games were much different . This game felt like nothing we had ever played , and no gaming experience was even close to what we got from the playing the original Resident Evil . Back then , there was still alot of social debate whenever a game came around that featured a significant amount of violence , yet Resident Evil was so unique in that it literally felt like being trapped in a scary zombie movie . There was n't much debate surrounding the gratuitous amount of gore like there was with other games ( Mortal Kombat ) , and instead gamers and critics were unified in their praise of the game 's excellent and unique gameplay and experience.Gamecube would later revamp the game with updated graphics , better voice acting , and many new thrilling surprises , but you just ca n't beat that feeling you got when you first popped in this game not knowing what to expect . This game has one of the greatest legacies , and is every bit deserving of all the accolades accumulated since .	1
Wow , first off I have to say 'pure classic ' . I love this game , in all of its dated graphics and game play with additional cheesy ( Jill Sandwich ) dialoge glory . That is what this baby is , glory . A truly excellent game , with excellent graphics , for its time and it 's , for this nerd at least one of the fondest memories of my wasted childhood I have . In fact this is one of the things I spend countless hours mastering that I do n't regret one bit.The control is simple and responsive , which I like . This game to me was my first introduction to actual video games , sure I 'd play Mario or Primal Rage or what ever on the old SNES . Then one fatefull day young Kazuki Ferret was ( at age 8 ) introduced to Resident Evil . The game for him , challenging puzzles which tested intellect , well designed levels and characters , and o ' course guns.Looking back now , this game was an excellent first for the giant we know today as the Resident Evil series . With such classic games as RE2 , RE3 , Code : Veronica , and RE4 stemming from it . This game is a simple must own in your video game collection , if you see a copy and do n't own one ; buy it is what I say . I got the copy I have for $ 5.00 , which is an excellent price for such a classic game . There is no reason not to own this game.-Kazuki Ferret , 'The Angry Resident Evil Nerd '	1
this is a pretty good game except for the music gets annoying sometimes such as the B1 floor of the mansion however the disc had a few scratches it was in good condition ..	1
The story tells that people were strangely disappearing in the Arklay Mountains , northwest Raccoon City . Half of the S.T.A.R.S. , a police group who 's always hired when things go really bad , goes in to investigate , but they do n't come back . That 's when the rest of the group come to Arklay Mountains to see what 's happening to those missing people and to the missing part of the team ... They would just wish they were never born.Resident Evil is a classic video game series . Unfortunately , the first movie was n't nearly as good as any of the main games from the series . The graphics might not be great since most of us own next-gen consoles like PS2 , Xbox and GCN , but they 're still decent.The soundtrack is amazing , voice acting is a little weird and a little silly , but it 's OK. Videogames are n't about how close to reality it looks and feels . If it was , games from the past would be forgotten very quickly . What makes horror games special is how fun and scary they are , and this , along with Silent Hill , is the best horror game you 'll ever play .	1
Soul Blade is the very first game in the Soul Caliber series . I guess it was Soul Blade in the arcade and became Soul Caliber years later for the Dreamcast and they decided just to go with that from then on . It 's quite a classic in my opinion . That 's actually why I bought it because to be honest the game play has aged a bit and there are much tighter fighting games out there now . It 's still a great game to have though . Aside from being the arcade game there is also a weapons master mode in which you select a character and play out a story where you travel the land acquiring new weapons in search of the legendary Soul Blade . If you were into arcade fighting games in the 90 's then you should probably have this .	1
Ok this game is pretty much all PS2 owners have of Soul Caliber since it went to DreamCast ? ! My friends still come over so we can all play it on my PS2 ! ! This game is tight , especially for a PS1 game , I just hope Soul Caliber 2 is made for the PS2 ! For the price this game goes for , it 's worth it completly ! I traded Granturismo3 ( PS2game ) for it !	1
When 3D fighters first entered with Virtua Fighter , I was not impressed . Add to that the dismal nature of the Star Wars fighter and things did not look promising . But , thanks to games such as this and Tekken , the fighting genre was saved . I first played this game in the arcade and was floored . Gone were the glitching side to side movements . In were smooth animations with amazingly real movement . It translated as close to flawlessly as possible to the Playstation.From the opening sequence to the finale , I was hooked . The graphics are amazing . The characters are very well rendered and rather well balanced . You have your constent movement , fast players as well as the guard forever and kill in one blow slow guy along with many consistent characters . My favorite character is Taki , but that 's probably because she reminds me of Chung Li.Game control is excellent . Combos rely less on stick movement than on button combinations , which makes it much easier for beginners to pick up . Throws are actually a challenge to execute , but are worth the work . The backgrounds are truly amazing and the soundtrack is something else . The tracks are very deep with what seems like full orchestration.Of course the greatest fun is playing against other people , but the single player formats available are quite good . The Edge Master mode is somewhat RPG-like in nature and is a nice addition . My favorite mode is the team battle where your 5 take on the opponents 5.For the price , you absolutely can not beat this title . The gameplay is great and the controls are rather intuitive . Give the bonus of amazing graphics and sound , if you like fighting games , you 'll love this one .	1
How can you go wrong with the game that started it all ? I love playing this and I love watching the animations from the characters that are STILL identical to the ones used on later Soul Calibur games ! They did n't change some of them ! Its pretty neat .	1
I remember playing this game when I was younger . I like this original Soul Blade game more , because the character Hwang . He wielded a Chinese two handed straight sword . The disc was in perfect condition . Very good classic game .	1
Soul Edge - Circa 1996GOOD : - Gameplay is pretty balanced- Some nice unlockables- Different and interesting story for a fighter- Pretty good sound track for a fighterBAD : - Graphics looked pretty dated- Voice-Overs are not so goodIF IT FITS YOUR TASTE : - Play story mode to unlock new swords characters and costumes- Plays like Tekken , but with weapons- Medieval Theme has Ninjas and Samurais fighting Pirates and KnightsGAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO : - Tekken 2- Virtual Fighter 2ADDITIONAL NOTES : - This is the first game in the Soul Caliber franchise- In the arcade this game was called Soul Blade	1
like play game as fun and enjoy . have n't play for long time and final get so like play what I can say that all	1
Twisted Metal 2 is one of the best Twisted Metal games , I still like Black better . I liked the movie where Axel goes back to his father and rips his arms out of his machine . I hate the T rating . Buy this game NOW !	1
Twisted Metal 2 was a HUGE game back in the day . The graphics were really good for its time , and the play control , while some will probably argue with me , was always accurate and responsive . This is truly a classic game . It had many imitators that hardly anyone remembers these days . Stick with the Twisted Metal series though . You ca n't go wrong with the amount of destruction this game has to offer .	1
When I got this game I was thrown back to the days I went to my uncles house just to play this game with him . Its fun and its cool that they use real locations for the battle , because you get to blow things up and find secret path ways and weapons to defeat your enemies . I have most of all the TM games and I ca n't wait to have them all , even the games that where made from different game company . Because the game play over all is the same .	1
This game is awesome , it is better then black except for the graphics , sound and story . But , gameplaywise , this game excels ! Innocent pedestrians , secret goodies , destorying the eiphel tower , while you find and destory these things you take on several different competitors out there and utilize their special attacks to YOUR advantage . ON single player this game is kinda tedious , but on 2p , HELLO FUN . I had a buddy who played this with me every time he came over to my house . We beat the game several times , but exploiting new characters attacks and finding more goodies as we traversed really ruled ! IF this game had sound and graphics , and some better storyline , this would be in the top 20 games of all time ! ALso Twisted metal 4 and 3 [ was not good ] , get tw1 or tw black instead .	1
Now this one was way more fun than TM-1 . What was fun was the endings etc where it would show the little video clips . Liked seein them they were crazy . This game was fun though for sure to play with friends and all .	1
Being a long time Twisted Metal fan this game would have to be my favorite in the series . Amazing Soundtrack , Great level design , unique characters , and an overall fun experience , especially with friends . I highly recommend this to any fan of action games .	1
I rented this game because I am a big TM fan . I 'll tell ya ' , this game is pretty old and does n't have the best graphics , but it 's awesome . The levels are cool . My favorite is Holland : Field of Screams . The characters are awesome too . My favorite is Minion . One of the things that I almost immediately noticed about this game was the machine guns . I do n't even know why they give you machine guns on TM 3 and 4 . They do n't do anything . On TM 2 the machine guns actually do some damage and debris flies off other vehicles when they are hit . It would take a week to kill someone with your machine guns on TM 3 and 4 . Actually you would be killed in less than a minute if all you use is a machine gun on TM 3 and 4 . If you want a good vehicular destruction game , you can buy any TM game , they are all fun , but I recommend TM 2 . It will provide hours of fun , especially deathmatch mode .	1
Introduction : When i bought my playstation i had now clue of any twisted metal games until I played this one . I never was able to get my hands on the first one but this one is amazing.The Game : Twisted metal is a car compitition almost like demolition derby except with crazy characters and weapons . Many games have tried to copy this gameplay but none could ever create one like this . The competition is held by Calypso and he gets people in search of help to join his competition and if they win through the 8 levels of demolition they get one wish from him . Calypso is all in this for entertainment while the characters are in it for something important.The Good : This game is one of a kind and has many good points . First of all is the gameplay . It is replayable and you can chose from any vehicle/character and take him through the end of the game and see his ending story . All of the characters are unique in an individual way and they each have their own special to terminate enemies . There are plenty of weapons to pick up and fire at opponents like the homing missile and fire missile and napalm . The levels are well designed and there are eight of them to battle through . The co-op mode makes the game especially fun but takes away the story aspect at the end . Also each vehicle makes their own sound when using there special.The Bad : The graphics can be a little bit choppy at times and many of the obsticals are flat . Some of the story lines are not worth playing through the whole game , you just have to be careful who you pick.Conclusion : Overall the game is excellent and is a must buy even if our deciding to buy it now and you have a ps2 .	1
this was the first game I ever played with interavtive environments it was really cool to blow the eifel tower up or make ice sheats fall with your opponet on them this game was awesome and i still play it even though i have a PS2	1
Twisted Metal 2 is the best playstation game ever ! The levels are fun because they are so different from one another . Each level provides interactive fun ! The cars are great and the specials weapons are excellent ! The ending movies , like the tital suggests are twisted . I do not find this game offensive in any way and I think it good for responsible kids ages 8 and up . Everyone should buy this game . It is the best of the four Twisted Metal games ! You will love it !	1
The Twisted Metal games in my opinion have seen their day since this gem was released . I have spent many hours playing this game either by myself or with friends . This game is a lot of fun with a lot of replay value . The game boasts good graphics and sound . I would recommend this game to anyone that is into vehicular combat , fighting games and competitive fun .	1
Even though it came out a little over six years ago , Twisted Metal 2 still stands as one of PS1 's best games and the best Twisted Metal game in the entire series . The graphics are a bit dated by today 's standards , but everything else still holds up . The environments are huge and fully interactive ( you can blow up the Eiffel Tower in Paris and destroy he gown around the Statue of Liberty to reveal a bikini in New York ) , and the control was at its peak here in all of the Twisted Metal games . Without a doubt a Playstation classic , this deserves to be in every PS1 or PS2 player 's library .	1
Twisted Metal two is by far the best Twisted Metal game in the series . The levels are awesome the weapons are awesome the characters are really awesome ! So many memories came back to me while playing this game and it is still a very fun game to play . The controls take some getting use to since the game is over 10 years old but other then that the game has held up well over the years .	1
The title says it all , better than the first and third . TM Black was good but ultimately it will take a lot to revive the series .	1
a real classic . it works . no problems . I love it and will always keep this game . I recommend it to anyone .	1
Well here 's the lowdown , the twisted fighting , plot , and cars are back in this hit sequel to the best selling series Twisted Metal . TM2 brings you back into the Twisted Metal Competition . But this time , it 's a one way trip 'round the world . Battle in L.A. to Hong Kong and leave a trail of destruction behind you . TM2 introduces a few new characters into the fray : Twister , Grasshopper , Shadow , Axel , and Mr. Slam . Duke it out with a wide variety of old favorited weapons to new and improved weapons like the napalm , remote detonator , and the ricochet bomb . Beat all your opponents and you might get a chance to have an audience with Calypso , the twisted creator of the Twisted Metal Competition , and have your wishes fullfilled.Bottom Line : An awesome sequel to an already awesome game	1
with this racing game you actually race across the country from state to state . some of the vehicles that you can drive are a bus cop cars there are two different color cop cars both different top speeds an old roadster and lots more . there are at least 12 maps to choose from . enjoy .	1
I thought this game was actually very good for a racing game on the N64 so so early of a release . This is before alot of the other much better racing games came out and I was suprised to find such a fun game.However the game can get very anoying with the way the car crashes work out , some of the races are very repetitive and you really wont be finding any good bonus features that will make you excitited to play it after wards . The records of your times in races is erased every time you turn off your system , I 'm not sure if that has something to do with a pack of some sort but it sucks.Still like I said earlier , this is an early title for the N64 , you will be amazed at how well such a game so early is . Buy it if your into race games , ignore it if your looking for the best .	1
This is one of the funnest , most addictive game I 've ever play . You start out with 7 cars : A type I do n't remember , a lexus , a racecar , and using the cheat : A jeep , bus , and police car.At the beginning , a bikini babe waves the flag and you cruise down famous landmarks like San Fransisco or Grand Canyon , etc . It 's high-speed action from there ! You can turn traffic on or off , and you can crash into cars hard , but you always keep on goin'.GraFX : 3* This is primitive N64Sound : 5* The soundtrack is the best ! Gameplay : 5*Fun : 9999999999999999999999999* IT 'S THE BOMBOverall : 9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999*Overall , this is one of the best games ever	1
Note : This review is going to be short , since there is n't really much to say about the game.Cruis'n USA is n't actually as bad the averaged out Amazon rating says . There 's some good arcade-style racing here . You may not be interested in this category if you like games like Mario Kart , but it 's still a pretty good game . Granted , there are some pretty cheesy things that have been said in-game ( `` Wow , so THIS is the Grand Canyon ! `` ) , but you can get used to that easily.Another thing that some may complain about is that the game is short . You can beat the game in a little less than a half hour . But I do n't care about how long a game is . It just needs to fit with its price ... and boy , do you have a chance of buying a used copy for a few bucks.The game is like Rad Racer on the NES , but 10 times better . If you like games that are similar to Rad Racer , Ridge Racer , or maybe Need for Speed , then Cruis'n USA is definitely something to buy .	1
Unlike some other reviewers I actually found that this game was enjoyable . The only complaint I have is that the graphics looked like they belonged to a Super Nintendo . Besides that the game is awesome.The basic outline of the game is that you race the USA from California to Washington DC . Each level gets harder as you pass along but not to worry . Once you get the hang of the game you will beat the level after a few tries . Each time you complete the whole entire racee ( California to D.C. ) you will earn a faster car.So , all in all Crus n ' USA is a pretty enjoyable game . Buy and enjoy.HAPPY GAMING !	1
Do you remember sitting behind the steering wheel at the arcade and playing this game ? I know I do ! Brings back a lot of memories !	1
This is fun I think it is a little less fun the next one crusin world because the game playthrough always follows the exact same path and the tracks are all fairly boring .	1
a fun game to battle against your friends . up to 4 players can play at a time . this is one fun game to have .	1
Starfox was one of the premiere games for the Super Nintendo , boasting some of the best graphics that any platform of the time could show off and yes the game , at the time , did deliever in what could be described in a & quot ; Tour de force & quot ; performace . When the game transitioned making it 's way onto the Nintendo 64 I had to hail the calling of this game and buy it , so I did . The result ? I was as happy as any person could have been after spending the money for this game , and it was worth it . The game is easy to beat , but , only on the easy route . There are hundreds of ways that give this game a replay value that could be unmatched at the time , such as getting medals for every planet in the & quot ; Galaxy & quot ; in order to unlock expert mode , or the ability to win tanks in multiplayer mode , or even be able to fight on foot . So , is this game worth the money you would pay for it now ? yes , give this game a home on your shelf . Enjoy .	1
There 's a strong case for this title being N64 's most replayable , with a heart rivaled only by Zelda . The arcade and score-based gameplay alone means competitive revisits , and you can absorb a complete experience in a reasonable timeframe , like a good TV show . Even with the kid friendly premise , there is a sense of true emotion between the characters . You care about Fox , his team , and the strife they encounter . Most of all , this game has yet to be topped for its kind - the closest they got was the 3DS remake , but even that is n't a whole new game ( plus the voices were way better in this one ) .	1
This game is fairly short and can be beaten in a matter of ten minutes on the easy route , but it does provide other secrets and ways to go about the game . You can go through three main paths , but you can quirk the paths if you decide to or if you screw up on one part of the level . You definitely will find yourself going back trying to unlock the different multiplayer modes and trying to up your high score . The rumble pack is worked very nicely into to the title . The voices are also a nice added feature . Buy this game guys .	1
Gameplay : You play Fox McCloud , a fighter pilot for Starfox , and you 're at war with the forces of the evil Andross . It 's more or less a rail shooter , but there 's some free-roaming flight to be had at various points through the game . One of the best features of Starfox is that progression is non-linear . Your actions in each mission directly affect how you proceed through the game . For instance , if you defuse the bomb on one level , you go one route . If you fail , you end up playing a different level.Graphics : You have to be a little forgiving of Starfox in this area . It 's a fairly early N64 game . In the grand scheme of N64 graphical quality , Starfox 64 is probably somewhere near the bottom . But if you 're turning down the new 3DS Starfox in favor of the old school one released fifteen years ago , chances are you wo n't care about that.Sound : The music is pretty good , as is the voice-acting . Although it lacks the polish and natural feel of some later N64 games with voice-acting , Starfox 64 still has one of the best uses of voice-acting on the system . Flying through space shooting aliens and talking on a radio to your teammates go hand in hand.There 's still a lot of fun to be had with Starfox , even after all this time . I rented it and progressed most of the ways you could progress back in the day , and I 'm glad to own it for the system now .	1
There is no save feature , but the whole campaign takes a hour at most . Just sick with some friends and & # 34 ; Do a barrel roll Skippy & # 34 ;	1
*The title is a quote from the final boss , Andross*A more accurate rating for this game , overall , is really 4.5 stars ; but , of course , Amazon wo n't let you grade in `` half stars . '' A true masterpiece , Starfox 64 stands as one of the greatest games ever created for the Nintendo 64 , and perhaps even all time . I recently got it as my first and only Star Fox title ; and , though I 'm normally not a fan of games with shooting and space ships like this , this game succeeded in impressing ! Analyzing its features step by step , it 's pretty hard to find reasons why this game should n't be loved : Storyline 10/10 : The story is absolutely captivating ! Though it starts out pretty simple and generic ( the galaxy and Corneria are being threatened by Venom , someone save us , etc . ) the backstory behind it is pretty detailed , the intro is epic , and the story itself takes on a whole new life when you start playing ! Actually , YOU are the one who controls the story to a degree : you can pretty much decide , through skill and/or choice , whether things go great or awful for the Star Fox team , a heroic pilot crew you can manipulate . You control Fox McCloud , and only Fox McCloud , but you also associate with the three pilots of Peppy , Slippy , and Falco ; why , just protecting Falco and doing certain actions on the first level can decide which way the story goes ! This game does a great job of drawing you into its world and making you want to figure out what 's happening.Characters 9/10 : I have to commend whoever came up with these interesting characters : they make the game ! Even on your own crew , each one is distinctive : Falco , for example , plays along the lines of `` the tough guy with a secretly caring heart . '' Peppy is like the fatherly instructive type , and Slippy plays along the lines of a new school boy . Finally , Fox , the same character you control , often takes on a reserved leadership role ( which makes sense ) . Each one has his own quirks ; and , though any of them can be annoying on a certain level , you ca n't help but feel a degree of liking for each of them . Their lines , though perhaps epic for the time , can be somewhat cheesy and/or cliche ( Peppy 's , `` It 's Quiet . . . too quiet . '' is a good example ) ; but the cheesiness adds to what is oddly a funny and light-hearted game . You often ca n't help but think , `` I should n't be laughing at this , '' but you 'll laugh anyway . It 's just that kind of game . The A.I . of each character on maneuvering is decent ; but , until you get skilled enough , it can be hard not to shoot at them or let enemies get them , as they get in your way at the oddest times ( then fuss at you when you do hit them ) . Peppy occasionally gives advice that does n't particularly help either , though it hardly ever hurts if you follow it . Speaking of advice , though , the game can make you depend on your characters if you 're newer at it , as they can each do something useful : Peppy gives advice and often tells you where to shoot , Slippy analyzes boss health meters , and Falco often covers you . If someone gets shot down , you 'll miss him . Finally , the characters are also pretty life-like in behavior : try shooting down enemies that Falco is chasing on some levels , and listen to his reaction to it.Graphics 9/10 : Some issues with fog ( common for Nintendo 64 games ) , but otherwise absolutely beautiful . The fog itself , even , can be justified , as you spend most of your time in the air . Though many stages take either a purely generic `` spacial '' theme , such as the asteroid field , the planets are really intuitive . In this game you can find a volcanic environment , which even mimics the `` wavy '' effects of heat , an ocean environment ( full of fish and plant life ) , a couple of cities , a train depot . . . the works ! The most interesting graphics you could see , however , has to be the part of the asteroid field you can `` warp '' to . Though it probably looks like you 've taken a medication or something else you should n't have , you ca n't deny the mysterious beauty of that point in the level . . . . Please note , however , that what levels you see depends on what paths through the game you take ; like the story , it 's dependent upon your actions in the levels.Mechanics 9/10 : This covers things like controls , ability to save , and learning curve ( whether it 's easy or hard to master ) . The controls , though they work well , are pretty complicated to learn . This complication , however , is eased by the nice training mode they threw in ; a few rounds in training mode , and you 'll pretty much have them down ! The game can still be pretty tough to a degree , though ; however , I was able to nearly make it through the entire game on one of my first three rounds ( and I 'm usually not too hot at games like this ) , before the Star Wolf team finished me off ( they 're pretty tough if you do n't know how to handle them right ) . Make sure to master the somersault maneuver ; I 've never seen a game force you to rely on it as heavily as this one ! In terms of saving , I was disappointed : there 's no way to save ; and , unlike what some people say , there 's no password feature either . You 'll probably get sick of the first level for that reason . While it 's not a deal breaker , this game is n't for the busy person who 's looking to play for only an hour or less and quit . If you want to experience the true value of this game , you 'd better set aside at least a couple of hours for it . The lack of a save feature is the biggest thing that kept me from giving this game a perfect score , as I kept catching myself thinking , `` This game would be perfect if only it had a save feature ! `` Music and Sound 10/10 : No complaints in the music and sound department ! It pretty much captures the mood , be it suspenseful , hopeful , dramatic , or even rewarding . The character voices are also well done , awesomely portraying the character personalities as well . I ca n't describe any of this justly , though ; you 'll have to listen for yourself ! Conclusion : Star Fox 64 is a face of near perfection , if only a few small blemishes had n't reared their ugly heads . Multiplayer , I hear , is lacking ; but , overall , none of the minor flaws in this game are major dealbreakers . Personally , I recommend this game to people who are bored and have a lot of time on their hands ; the replay value is great with its various paths ! The final boss can be downright creepy , and . . . well , I think any critique could easily go on forever ! Long story short , this game is an absolute steal at the cheap price it 's at now . A fond memory in many gamers hearts , this Star Fox 64 still remains as a highly recommended game to play !	1
Star Fox 64 ( known as `` Lylat Wars '' in Europe ) is a shooting game for the Nintendo 64 . You play as Fox Mccloud , and he must go on an adventure through space to find and destroy Andross . Throughout the game , Peppy , Slippy , and Falco help you.This game is really fun and addictive . It is also really short , and a little challenging in some parts . But when you learn the gameplay , it becomes really easy . This is a really fun game .	1
starfox for n64 will always be a classic , has fun game play only problem is that the game is n't overly challenging ( made to be win-able by kids ) and is n't a very long game i remember winning it on several occasions in one sitting ( but still taking several hours ) very fun game though	1
The cartridge was clean , game worked well . I bought in the game in hopes it 'd be fun but it 's not all great , not the seller 's fault though so 5 stars .	1
Was glad to find it . It works great . Still playing it . I was hoping I would get as much enjoyment out of it as when I was younger and I DO . Great replay value .	1
As with the first there is no save option but it is still fun to see how far you get in this game.Its nice and challenging its just a drag there is no continue or save option here.You can get extra lives though.Like most games it gets easier the more you play it.The graphics are superb and the music is very good too.I just recommend you get the first Star Fox cause that game is longer.You should still get this though .	1
How could you not love this game , the animals talk ! There are so many great lines from this game that I do n't really care about anythingelse except being able to hear `` do n't party just yet , time to try our new weapon . '' I just love this game , it can be as hard as you want it to be so stop saying it 's easy . Anyways , this game was put out 8 years ago and still every once and a while I decide to play this and I love it , cuase it has the talking animals on it . I 'm going to repeat this TALKING ANIMALS ! Slippy gets on my nerves though I just kill him becuase he always gets some guy on his ass and keeps bleating `` get this guy off my fox ! '' I wan na crack his skull everytime he says that it pisses me off . Then theres that stupid chick that knows Falco ( the bad ass of course ) and she is annoying , I wish I could kill her becuase when you go to the Z zone she steals your kills so you ca n't get the freaking medal I HATE HER ! It is so annoying that she steals your kills ! Oh that has to be the worst part of the game , it 's woefully madening . Also to not are the apes who try to kill you , though they make the noble animal of the ape villanious they still have memoriable lines like `` ANDROSS I 'VE FAILED YOU ! ! ! '' Then there is team wolf , they are tottaly bad ! They are pretty hard to kill on the other side of venom but like I said if you got the skills you may one day beat them ( and you say this game is too easy ! OH MY GOSH ! ) . Anyways I do like the bunny guy what 's his name ? I forgot but he 's like `` Your the best Slippy . '' and that makes me want to cry becuase they are always so hard on Slippy ! I love it that they actually give him love in Aquos cuase I 've heard the stories , poor Slippy . Anyways Fox is a stud of course , damn he is looking good ! He works hard of course , cuase I 'm controlling him . Anyways the best characters are the bosses cuase they say stuff to you that 's funny like that one boss `` admits defeat '' but then comes back after you cuase he was lying , what did you think you 'd get off that easy ! HECK NO ! Anyways I hope you love this game as much as I do , becuase I say those lines everyday before I go to sleep , cause it bring hope . Especially when the Bunny guy affectionatly tells Fox `` your becoming more like your father . '' Fox 's father was a pimp too ! That 's the ultimate compliment in the Lylat system ! I 'm sure Fox shed a tear when he heard that from his bunny partner . I 'm out , only a loser does n't like this game cuase he is a nerd with no sense of humor who wants to play a `` real '' flight simulator . YEAH !	1
In 1997 , Nintendo was on the cutting edge in the video gaming industry . The Nintendo 64 proved that no mateer what a CD-ROM gaming system was able to do , a cartridged based gaming system could do better . That June , the case really proved the theory with the release of Starfox 64 . The game was the very first to incorporate Nintendo 's Rumple Pak , a force-feedback device that let 's players feel each and every vibration at hand.In the game , you play Fox McCloud , a young determined fighter pilot who is sent on several missions to destroy Andross , a inane , mad genius that demands full control of the Lylat system . There are 15 remarkable stages that let you encounter in the entire game , alone over twenty-five different paths you decide on your way to Andross . The graphics are so realistic and full of promise , that you see the game so vividly , you feel like you 're a part of it . In Starfox 64 , you also have the use of 3 different vehicles , depending on your course , Arwing , Landmaster Tank , or the Blue Marine sub , only used in the Aquas sea level . The game also has a fierce battle level , for up to 4 players , where you shoot down your fellow squadron leaders , Peppy , Falco , and Slippy.It took nearly two years for other companies to develop the feel of the game , the exact same way Nintendo did with Starfox 64 . The game is exactly one of a kind in the pilot seat . While Nintendo stopped releasing the Rumble Pak with the game nearly six months later , Starfox 64 is still truly a Nintendo gamer 's paradise .	1
Star Fox 64 is one of the most fun games I 've ever played . It was one of the first N64 games to utilize the Rumble Pak ( it was also one of the first to include voices for all the characters ) . The premise of the game is simple : you , as Star Fox , are trying to save the solar system from the evil Andross . To do this , you hop in your space ship and blow tons of enemy crafts to bits . The game is simple but fun and can be replayed over and over . I 've played through Star Fox 64 more times than any other game I 've ever owned.The Good : The Gameplay is fast paced , simple and fun . Action packed- there is never a dull moment.The controls are tight and are perfect.The level design is excellent.The force feedback through the Rumble Pak makes the game feel more intense.The replay value is through the roof- there are many different ways to get to the final boss.All characters have voices ! Lots of Secrets ! The Bad : The & quot ; multiplayer & quot ; game is really really bad . It 's so bad that it is not worth playing . But that 's what Goldeneye is for , right ? The graphics , by today 's standards , are outdatedSome of the voices are pretty annoying ( Slippy in paticular ) This game is nothing short of a masterpiece . I still play Starfox 64 today , and it 's just as much fun as when I got it 6 years ago . Everything seems perfectly tweaked and just right . A game for the ages .	1
Finer words have never been spoken . StarFox 64 was the long awaited American sequel to the original StarFox for the SNES ( Japan got StarFox 2 on SNES while us Americans had to wait for StarFox 64 ) . Excellent game , superb 3D graphics and for the love of Michael Douglas , play with the RUMBLE PACK !	1
People played this in the store for days on end even though most could not afford it for the N64 . Star Fox was an amazing blast em up for the N64 that was visually stunning to watch .	1
At first I thought this game [ stunk ] cause there was no save feature but there is a password feature and you can use other people 's passwords to start out on whatever level you feel . Cheating has never looked so good ! There are great graphics and action and the gameplay is very straightforward.All in all it deserves an A - . A great gift to receive in September .	1
Even a decade down the line , this is a great game . The original Star Fox on SNES used a ground-breaking chip to create rudimentary 3D graphics . The N64 version took that and essentially upgraded it , giving the graphics an overhaul and tossing in a few new gameplay enhancements . This was one of the first games on the N64 to feature large amounts of speech , and also the first to use the rumble pak.You are Fox McCloud , leader of the Star Fox mercenary team . You blast through levels shooting up everything in sight , and blowing up massive bosses . The game uses a branching system , where out of the 15 possible levels you will explore a total of 7 in any given play-through . So each play-through is short , but there is replay value in going back and unlocking the alternate paths . And the action is so fast and intense that you 'll be coming back multiple times anyway.There was never really a Star Fox game for Gamecube to top this one , so Star Fox 64 still remains a favourite . Proof that great gameplay can outlast aging graphics . A must-own for any N64 collection .	1
Star Fox on the SNES ... Not the best space shooter . Star Fox on the Nintendo 64 ? 2ND BEST GAME ON THAT SYSTEM ( The first is Ocarina of Time ) ! Every level was packed with thrilling action ! On the first level I enjoyed an easy ride along Corneria , gliding across the lakes listening to Peppy complain . The 2nd level ( Meteo ) really picked up the pace , and the drama was incredible for the Nintendo 64 . The level opens with Peppy saying `` It 's quiet . Too quiet . `` , quickly followed by , `` LOOK OUT IT IS A TRAP ! ! ! ! `` , followed by a hoard of enemies , then giant meteors , ending with the most disturbing thing I 've ever seen in a video game . A giant space craft swoops down and a monkey with a british accent says `` I can not allow you to go any further '' . After a short time the british monkey says `` I am no match for you . I admit defeat . '' The whole game goes silent , and then the monkey yells `` IF THIS DOES NOT WORK ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! '' . He fires a huge amount of lasers , and then calls me scum after I defeat him . Time for Level 3 ! This one was also disturbing , but provided the greatest thrill I had ever had . The Star Wolf team comes in , saying some very creepy comments while they beat me . `` You 'll be with your dad soon Fox ! '' ( Fox 's dad is dead ) , `` I 'm going to bust you up REAAALLL good ! '' ( says the pig who betrayed Fox 's dad ) , and `` Go back to the pond , Froggy. '' . Then , right in the middle of that big fight , the robot assistant comes in and says `` DANGER ! A bomb has been discovered in the base ! Explosion in 1 minute ! '' Level 4 was at the climax of wierdness , though . A giant terminator-like robot came in and started repeating `` DESTROY ! DESTROY ! '' . I have not been able to get level 4 , the robot always crushes me and then I get Game Over . I do highly this game , though . It is possibly the most thrilling game on the N64 ! Trust me , it is addicting .	1
i just got this game today and it is fun and very intense.also this game is from 1997 and its still really fun	1
It can be said that this game is easy , maybe the graphics is terrible but at the time i loved this game i 've not touch this game in years however i can say i really enjoyed this all time classic.For the people who are true nitendo fans this is a classic that you can add to your 64 libary . I still have my 64 and it works great so does the games , Starfox is worth a try laterz folks .	1
Mario Party is the kind of game that became an instant classic ! Play it once and your hooked ! If you grab three friends and play , there is no better feeling in the world . Play , what seems like endless mini-games , with either Mario , Luigi , Princess Toadstool ( a.k.a . Peach ) , Wario , DK , and ( my personel favorite ) Yoshi ! Believe me , this is a good deal for such a good game !	1
Yeah . So the story is very weak . Things are often like that for multiplayer-centered games . At least Mario Party had actually TRIED to spice things up with a story . Where 's the story for Super Smash Bros. ? Where 's the story for Mario Kart 64 ? I did n't think so . As weak as the Mario Party story is , the story is n't important for a game ... the gameplay is . Some games with great stories have fallen flat because of poor gameplay . Other games with NO story succeed with great gameplay . Mario Party is definitely in the latter category . You can hate the Mario Party series for its excellent `` Land Before Time '' impression . You can be among the groups of people that prefer Mario Party 2 and Mario Party 3 . Yet there is one thing that you must admit . Mario Party was DARNED fun back in 1999 ! Sure , people said to NEVER play with one person , but playing all four characters as one person can be a blast as well.Anticipation may have been the first board-game video game for Nintendo , but it was n't exactly successful , and had relatively primative gameplay . So people now associate Mario Party with the introduction of board-game video game , and it 's definitely more like a board game than any other game before it . I mean , you `` roll a dice '' and move around the board encountering various pitfalls and experiencing different events . Although most of the boards are well-designed , I have realized that the majority of the `` board-game '' aspect is text or movement , and somebody watching a tape with only footage the `` board-game '' aspect would likely get very bored very fast . But what makes Mario Party the gem that it is are ... the mini-games ! Yes , Mario Party has 56 mini games to entertain all souls from all walks of life . Sure , not all mini-games are perfect , but you know what ? Even with all of the blisters , broken glasses , and white powder appearing on the N64 controller , the mini-games are still worth it ! Especially Mushroom Mix-Up and Running of the Bulb . Oh yeah . Those are great games . Mushroom Mix-Up provided tons of frantic fun and Running of the Bulb was hectic but exciting . 4-player teamwork games really need to make a comeback.Being a title developed by a third party ( yes , Hudson is a 3rd party developer ) , the graphics in Mario Party are not exactly polished . Most of the textures are just simple polygons . And as was stated , the water is in the Bombs Away game is extremely pixelated . These graphics are not the ones that are so grand that you ca n't help but go `` Uah , '' but why bother with visual aesthetics when the game is already filled with gameplay finesse . At least the graphics do n't hurt your eyes . I ca n't say that about a game that game out 3-4 months after Mario Party ... I 'm sure you all know what it is . Sound . Sound effects are amusing , but not exactly something special . Voice acting is good , but I finally found out ( after five years ) that much of the voice samples were lifted directly from the Japanese version of Mario Kart 64 . The music ? It is fantastic ! There 's a hint of Super Mario Bros. mixed in with the rest . It 's great to listen to , even if it is all just MIDIs . Okay , a lot of this is probably due to nostalgia . I can write a paper on nostalgia and Mario Party , but I 'll leave it at this . The bottom line is , even though Mario Party is n't one of the technologically advanced games on the N64 , it sure makes up for it with its incredible gameplay .	1
I 've had this game basically since it launched in 2000 . I must say , the graphics are rather impressive for an N64 game , and the gameplay is great . The minigames are fun , especially when playing with other people . The only real problem I had with this game is how it did n't last long at all . It has about 100-150 mini games , but you can easily beat the game and unlock them all within about a week of good playing time .	1
You either love mario party or hate it , I always wanted it as a kid and i finally bought it . Great to play with my college friends	1
I still remember the first time I played this game , it remains a favorite even today . Some minigames are a bit simple , but I still love it ! Ony complaint : PADDLE BATTLE ! Who 's stupid idea was this ? Rotating the controlstick gives me blisters ! Ouch !	1
Mario Party is a fun board game video game where you are on a game board trying to earn stars . You hit blocks to determine the number of spaces you move and earn or lose things depending on the space you land on . Then , at the end of each turn you play a mini game . There are other fun things to do , like play in the mini-game stadium , shop for new games and play individually to earn prizes . However , one major downer ? The rotating hand games . Play this game enough and games like & quot ; Cast Aways & quot ; the one with the light bulb , and the 1 vs 3 riverboat game will cause blisters in your hand ! If you like this one then check out the 2nd one as well for more options , new board games and mini-games as well as new gameplay features . However , some mini games and boardgames in this version are really great so give em both a go !	1
When i first played this game last Christmas , for the first time , i thought & quot ; oh my goodness , how do you play this ! & quot ; ... this is a mario game but at that time i was n't feeling too well and the strange appearance of the game made my head spin.As a result , i played tomb Raider : TLR insetad . Happy to tell you that today , i 'd rather play this game than Tomb Raider.Well , it 's like a board game but much more fun . Lot 's of minigames , lots of chances to shout and swear ( not that i 'm telling you to ) but it 's all good-natured fun.The characters look kind of silly ( esp Yoshi and Peach who look like circus rejects ) but i do n't think the purpose of playing a mario game ( or any decent video game ) is to see hunks and babes.However , this game falls short of Mario Kart replay glory 'cause the formula can get tired at times.But if you want a solid first-party party game , then this is it . I have n't played GoldenEye 007 or Perfect Dark yet- so as far as pure multiplayer mania is concerned , this is number 2 next to Mario kart 64.Yes , it 's that good .	1
This is a awesome game it 's fun and chalaging . it 's fun for the whole family	1
I 'll be doing the Mario Party games next and besides this one and 9 , I have the entire series . 1 is the first one I played and still the one I hold very highly as one of the best ones in the series.The plot is very generic . Toad wants to test everyone and see who can be the super star and thus the game that destroys friendships begin . The original Mario Party is known for its difficulty in terms of mini games as the controllers back in the day were either unresponsive or some were just way too hard and required luck . I might even add that some mini games like the tug-o-war required you to twirl your controller to the point that it might even break or hurt your hand . Yeah some of the mini-games are brutal . On the plus side , there are some memorable mini games where you had to work together to win the game and personally we did n't see that until Mario Party 9 with the boss battle.The game overall had the most nostalgic feel and introducing the character 's personalities through the stages . This game kind of set up Peach 's obsession with cake and Luigi being the gadgeteer of the two brothers . The music for the stage is very cute especially in Rainbow Castle . I love how whoever gets 4th place gets the butt monkey treatment and attacked by the stage while 1st player achieves the mission needed.Overall , a good start for the series , but good luck finding this game . This game never reached the virtual console because of the controls so its a rare find in any trade in store without it being at extremely high prices .	1
The cart is functional and came as pictured . This is a great game for inciting fist fights and destroying friendships of all ages . Would recommend to anyone looking to end an unsavory relationship .	1
The original Mario Party is a must , as previous mentioned in the title , for any retro gamer and collector of classics . Those of you who have played Mario Party 8 or 9 for the Wii can now see the humble beginnings of this popular series of hit family games.Unlike Mario Party 8 , there is a somewhat more interesting storyline where the six most famous characters of the Mushroom Kingdom ( Mario , Luigi , Peach , Yoshi , DK , and Wario ) are arguing over who could be the Super Star . After a rather amusing argument sequence , the six are placated by Toad to play a variety of games in order to achieve good deeds and become the Super Star.When held in comparison of the boards of Mario Party 8 and 9 for the Wii , the boards of Mario Party 1 are still holding up well . Naturally , the graphics are incredibly dated , but the design is a tad more intricate and focuses on gameplay instead of the visual style . The rules are the same for each board also : - You and three other players move around the board in a predetermined amount of turns- Play addictive and fun mini-games- Collect coins and ( hopefully ) a star or two- Try not to run into Bowser who will cause nothing more but trouble and steal your money or stars- And after each amount of turns play out , you get a cool little cinema of victory if you win.While I consider Mario Party 8 visually better and more entertaining , this game is still a classic and not just because it started the Mario Party craze . I love this game because the music is very cool compared to the strange pieces played in 8 and the controls are much more easier to use than the erratic unpredictability of the Wii-Remotes . All in all , a solid purchase .	1
The days when people said , & quot ; We 're having a Party , A Mario Party ... & quot ; Seems to be long past . When this game first came out , it seemed to be the only thing people talked about . Yet today , with 5 Mario Parties in the collection , this one still is wonderful for being the base roots.Just like any of the other Mario Parties , you choose which character you 'd like to be , Mario , Luigi , ect . The object of the game is to go around the board and collect Stars . Stars come at a price , 20 coins . To get 20 coins , you must win mini games or land on blue spots . This is like an advanced board game for the N64 , but with a twist . In addition to the board game aspect of this game , after everyone takes 1 turn a mini game takes place.Competitions in this mini game include : Everyone against eachother1 Vs 32 Vs 2This is where the intense fun comes on . You and your friends button smash , spin the analog stick to your hearts content . As a matter of fact , so much button smashing ( fast taps on the buttons ) takes place that gloves came out for this game to protect your hand . Be warned , if you 're too competitive with this particular Mario Party , you may wind up with a blistered palm or sore fingers.It 's overall pure fun . Games can last for hours and hours if you really want . Though playing a board game on a console sounds dull , this game completely opposite of that ! If you want a great N64 game ... this is a must buy.If you are interested in this game , but do n't want to play an older console anymore or do n't have a N64 , I recommend Mario Party 4 and 5 for the Nintendo Gamecube . Exceptionally fun , with quite a bit less dangerous button smashing .	1
The first of the Mario Party games ! It really is an awesome game . I only played it at a friend 's house as a child really , so now , many years later , I finally decided to get it for myself , along with 2 and 3 . The n64 games are classic.I really only play it by myself , but it is so much funner to play with friends . You can get so angry when someone steals your star . This is how you get in fights with your friends.The mini games are fun , not as fun as 2 and 3 though.Never going to regret buying this game : )	1
I Got This Game In Excellent Condition In June Of 2003 , But I Have Loved It Since It Came Out In America On February 8 , 1999 . I Recommend Buying It Without EVER Renting It ! There Are A Couple Of Mini-Games that are not good for your controller and can blister your hand . they involve spinning the Control Stick . and you have to do so vigorously otherwise you 'll lose . I Have all eight games . I 'm nealy 21 years old and I Love Mario Party !	1
When Nintendo first made it onto the scene with Mario 64 , they had no idea of how interesting it is to mold and shape the format of the Mario Brothers industry for the Nintendo 64 . It became so big , that every single thing had to be topped off to the next level of excitement , and so on down the line.With Mario Party for Nintendo 64 , they had absolutely no idea of how successful it has become . The game features your choice of six characters to choose from , Wario , Mario , Peach a.k.a . Princess Toadstool , Yoshi , Luigi , and Donkey Kong . The object of the game is to collect as many stars as possible by winning several different types of games including Tug O ' War , where it is 1 player vs. 3 players , Bombs Away , where you have to try stay on a floating island for 30 seconds , without getting the shock from cannon shots coming , and there is Deep Sea Divers , where you have to collect as many treasure chests as possible , without losing your breath . There are also six different kinds of boards to play the game on , as well as two very special hidden boards , so look out.It is a shame that most games did n't seem to be like Mario Party . Although many people are interested in the newer ones and the Gamecube version , the original is always the best one to try for starters . If you really want it , then roll the dice and take that very first chance .	1
Presentation : Back in the day Nintendo wanted another fun multiplayer game to create that does n't exactly involve racing and thus the first of many Mario Party games was created . Let 's see how they did in this new evolution to one of the most influential franchises in gaming.Gameplay : This was one of the first Nintendo games to include 4 player multiplayer and boy did people love this ! Basically this game is like a board game , you start off with 10 coins and you roll a dice to determine where you go depending on the spaces you land on you can have fortunate things happen to you , unfortunate things , or you can end up gaining or losing coins . At the end of each turn the 4 players compete in a mini-game where the winner has a chance to win 10 coins . You want coins so you can have enough to buy a Star from Toad or maybe even have Boo steal one for you . When you 've made a whole lap around the board depending on the time of the game Koopa Troopa will give you neither 10 or 20 coins . After 20-50 turns when the game ends youhave a chance to win bonus stars , the person with the most stars after that wins ! The gameplay is a lot of fun whether you are playing alone or with friends . 9/10Music and Sound Effects : The music is very catchy to listen to , and the sound effects are good for the most part . The voice acting however is hilarious , nothing like hearing Wario yell `` DOH ! I MISSED ! ! '' . 8/10Story : The story is for the most part an amateur story . However most Mario games are , Mario and his friends one day argue about who is the best and they decide to find out who is through multiple games of Mario Party . In the meantime Bowser trys to cause trouble for the characters and they end up eventually defeating him at his volcano . Angered by this he tries to defeat them again in space , luring them there by stealing their stars . They once again defeat Bowser , and the winner of that game is declared the Superstar . The default winner of the game is Wario . 6/10Overall : Mario Party is a great single player and multiplayer game . And can be enjoyed by anyone of any age though the game is out of date I find this to be one of the best of the Mario Party series . With this I give this game an overall score of 8.5/10 !	1
This game is so much fun ! This is where it all started this game is one of the best mario parties . There 's 6 characters who are arguably to this day still the most popular mario characters . There 's 50 minigames and 8 fantastic boards !	1
I had a N64 back then in 1998 , so I got this game . It is great ! GAMEPLAY : WOW ! GREAT GAMEPLAY ! There 's awesome characters ( Donkey Kong , Peach , etc . ) and the game is like a little electronic gameboard . with a dice , and spaces ( lots ) that you can trust.MINIGAMES : Great minigames ! There 's SHYGUY SAYS , a game where you'r supposed to press whatever button he tells you . And a game which you can make a treasure chest come to you.GRAPHICS : Pretty good for an N64 game , the only other N64 game that had grat graphics was PERFECT DARK.SOUND : Great . Pretty great for an `` old '' game.OVERALL GRADE : A+So If you have an N64 , then get this game !	1
In Mario Party , you take control of one of six Nintendo characters ( Mario , Luigi , Peach , Yoshi , Wario , or Donkey Kong ) and move around a board as if you were playing a board game . After each turn , you play a minigame . At the end of the minigame , the winner ( s ) get coins . The coins can then be used to buy stars from Toad . Sometimes you run into Bowser , who does something random , but never helps anyone . The winner is the character with the most stars at the end of a set amount of turns . A true original by Nintendo . However , there is a major problem with the controls ... As you may have heard , there are minigames in Mario Party that require rotating the control stick . Doing this can lead to blisters on the palm of your hand . In fact , Nintendo realized this and was almost about to recall every copy of Mario Party . But instead , Nintendo released a statement to the public that they would send a glove to prevent blisters if you send them the cover of Mario Party 's instruction manual.I realize that there are many people out there that do not want to go through the hassle of having to do more than buying the game in order to play the game . Specifically , the people who usually lose the instruction manual to their games the second after they open the box . In this case , how is the person going to be able to get the glove if they could not provide the object that Nintendo was looking for ? Nintendo should have found some other way to distribute the gloves . A way that would allow anyone who has the game , and can not keep track of everything , get there hands on , or in , a glove.Nintendo should have noticed this defect and corrected it before releasing Mario Party . But do n't let that stop you from buying it . It 's still a great game ; just do n't forget to buy a glove !	1
The first mario party while not the best mario party , holds a lot of nostalgia for me.if it were n't for the stick spinning minigames i 'd rank this in the top 3 .	1
miss play game for long time I have n't play so now final get and play as enjoy . alright thumb up	1
There were so many cool Hidden things in this game and strange little things that you could do beyond just racing . The glitch were when you were driving towards the center of the destruction Derby and hit it just right and go shooting into the air is my favorite . This always used to make my day as a kid	1
I remember renting this back in the day when Playstation was still in its infancy . I really like this game and I still play it today !	1
played this game years ago and owned it too but it got lost over the years lol . well now i have it agian and wow brings back memories : - ) the gameplay is simple u race , u wreck , and when all else fails u go backward and smash anything that moves . there is not a game like this currently . there have been some sequals but they are not like this and a new game like this would be awesome ! ! ! !	1
Decided to start collecting old-time PS1 games and this one is a must have . I remember playing this constantly throughout my childhood .	1
If you want a [ well priced ] , yet fulfilling few hours of destructive fun , this is your game . I found the ambience slightly disturbing , that 's good . Fans of the films will appreciate all the locales being included . The graphics are extremely dated , but for fans of old school games who do n't need extreme eye candy , this is a solid buy .	1
Originally released way , way back a little after the release of the original Playstation ; Acclaim 's Alien Trilogy ( you can tell this game is old considering the film series stopped being a trilogy when the fourth film Alien Resurrection was released a year later on ) is a straight forward first person shooter in which you play as Ripley going through all the Xenomorph infested areas from the first three films . By today 's standard 's the graphics , gameplay , and weapon options are all pretty dated , but in it 's day Alien Trilogy was one of the better FPS games to hit the PS1 . All in all , if you still have your PS1 and dig older FPS games , you should give this one time gem a look .	1
For those of us who got a PSX at rollout , Alien Trilogy deffinately belongs in the list of all time PSX classic games . Sure , by today 's graphics standards it 's not so great but it has great game play . The best thing about this game is the ambiance - dark , great music , it is a little scarry . The game is simple to play and control . Yes , the Doom/Unreal crowd wo n't like it - not enough buttons and weapons of mass destruction . No , this is the first person shooter your girlfriend will want to play too . Acclaim should remake this title for PS2 with more CG story cuts and cohesive plot .	1
The graphics and audio in this game really leave more to be desired , but the overall gameplay is loads of fun . Mission objectives and dificuly are good although you wo n't find yourself in a lot of full-blown shoot outs . Nevertheless , it is a good game and I definitely would reccomend it .	1
This game brought me hours of fun I do n't know what everyones problem is .	1
This game is VERY challenging and requires some brains , which is why I like it better than those other gun games . Even though I was losing , I was hooked to it and I did n't scream or curse the game either . So if you like those type of mind-challenging games , I recoomend this one . The only bad thing about it is the guns ( you can run out of ammo FAST ) but I gave the game 5 stars anyway .	1
I enjoy watching Tom Cruise do some interesting things in some of the strangest places . Walk around the hotels and things . It is much better than James Bond . It does n't have all of the gun sounds droning around . Go to the restroom or the bar .	1
well it starts off your this dude with orange battle armor on.youre traveling time to stop these giant bug/cyborg thingies from taking over.you get all the regular standard weopons like pistol , rifle , shotgun , bazooka , explosives etc.1st your in greece.you roam the desert , operate tanks , fight bugs , blow stuff up , blast mountainsides apart , fly jets , blow stuff up , go to atlantis , find runes , nuke bugs with a sun shield and much much more ! then its onto the rain forest in java.here theres lots of lava to avoid.i think the graphics here are beautiful.theres some cool boats , lots of cool planes.HERES A SPOILER : well i wouldnt call it one.theres this one particuraly tricky part on this board where unless you try to kill yourself , you wont see how to get past.im only telling this so you dont get stalled here like i did.your objective will be to find a way around mount rua rua.youll go way up this mtn and fight off a army of bugs sent by the man in black.once killed there is no obvious way to go.you must inch right up to the very edge of the cliff.there is a path leading downward right in between 2 large pools of lava.takeit to the temple.anyhow , next you go to america in the 60s.the cars all kick butt but no hippies , or love ins or partying , or ... ... ... ... ... .you sure this is the 60s ? the 1st board here is lots of fun.theres stunt cars with which you must jump over valleys , boulder busting , nitro experiments , aliens , you have to navigate a scud missle ... ... ... its great ! then onto antarctica ... ... ... ... ..no its siberia in the then future now past to battle more bugs.now theres zombies too.for fun you can grind them up in a combine.there cool about it though , theyll get up and get in your way some more.theres trains , hover crafts , mutagen [ maybe this is the board with the scud ] ... ..but all the fun stops here.the last board is im-freaking-possible without cheating.there are monsters who require being hit like 15-30 times with rockets wholl swarm you in packs of 30.or in other words , youre meat within seconds no matter how cool you think you are.so just put on the game shark and go to work.this game could be described as say duke nukem meets amorines or maybe starship troopers meets return of the jedi . [ what with the shield generaters and all ] .a great game with lots and lots of diversity.you cant get bored !	1
Time hero preventing alien harvests . Different time lines = different vehicles. -- -- -- -- -- -I find this game was very well thought out . The harvesting wall alone adds very much to the story . ( A shield boundary that you ca n't pass . ) As you progress through the game you get newer weapons and vehicles of that time period . Its rewarding when you stumble across a tank and then in turn wreak havoc on all aliens that you come to . Planes , boats , bikes , firetrucks you name it this game has that vehicle.This game sounds great also . YOu can hear the rifle reverb , all vechicles sound different and it has very interesting mood music.This game is very interactive which is why I like it so much . As you beat bosses and levels you can wrap back any time you want . A simple touch is that you can turn on or off all candles , lanterns , torches and lights in the buildings . You have to pull switches block windmills and at one point , use a fire truck to put out a fire.Ripping through the jungle in your jeep.. OHHH sheeet . to fast . You ditch it into a pond . There is one less jeep you can drive.This game is an orginal game idea that always earns bonus points . And it was done very well.To sum it up . I like the levels , all the vechiles , the graphics of mutalating a alien with a maching gun on the tank . The puzzles aspect . Its great.Some people are just a little to tough on this game . It reminds me of starship troopers so much.A very worthy classic . 4 1/2	1
I always wondered why I could never beat this game and as a 22 year old adult I figured it out ... This game is hard ! I will not post any spoilers but this game has done an awesome job with the technology available at the time of it 's creation and GTA takes homage to it and based gameplay similarities off it . Anyway , there are not many games in today 's day that makes games like this . It creates the atmosphere that you are under an imminent threat and you are never alone but at the same time it 's only you that lies between a saved planet and destruction . If you have n't played this game but want to play older games , I would highly recommend this . If you are like me and have n't beaten this game..Give yourself that satisfaction and DO IT !	1
This is my first review I 've done of a video game . Body Harvest is a game that 's very much fun to play . Although I read through the instruction booklet , this game SEEMS tough to figure out as to what to do next . It 's almost like having your -own- Johnny Quest cartoon to play . Although you get just one life in your player ( sort of a futuristic-like space warrior ) , you get plenty of chances to re-juice his power . The graphics , in MY opinion are good even though I 've heard others quoting that they did n't care for them . Also enjoy the music that starts up whenever the aliens start coming in for the kill . An hour can easily pass by when you play Body Harvest . A good game to own .	1
Body Harvest is like nothing you have played before . The idea is much like Blast Corps N64 and you actually harvest bodies in this game ! The stages on each level where quite big and hard to complete . It is highly unique and addictive . Anyway this was the leading N64 I played in the Winter of 1998 by at which stage we where hearing that the old 1994 Playstation 1 was about to undergo a change . There was an important reason why I gave up buying more games on the N64 after the Winter of 1998 or the whole of 1999 . I had been playing the N64 since the end of 1996 start of 1997 . I got two solid great gaming years out of it , with the following two years spent playing the mutliplayer N64 we loved and owned.It would another few years before I would pick up a games console again .	1
Rockstar games later went on to use the game engine and flight mechanics as well as the swimming and other parts of his game to improve what most of you would refer to as GTA : SA and GTA:4 , one could be labored to suggest that this game allowed and was the father of said games . In the gaming industry it happens often that one game either spawns or helps improve the industry standards and this game thou over looked did more for the gaming world then most figure or see.This game is to GTA , as Ultima Underworld is to Fallout 3 , and that is to say they are the for runners that improved future games . I suggest if your looking for good harmless violence without human on human violence I recommend this one if you still use your N64 . I would point out , that Human deaths that you allow or preform increase a ticking total and once you get to many you fail the level . So the game even goes so far as to not allow it , I will also add this game has one of the largest number of flying vehicles and ground vehicles and even boats and the likes of almost any game I have ever played in my entire life .	1
I was very surprised with Legend of Legaia when I first played it . Although the basic RPG formula is still basically intact , there are a few radically innovative bits that seem to work quite well.Take for example the amazing battle engine : while turn-based at its core , each character 's basic attack is instead a series of kicks and punches that YOU enter ( at the beginning of each round ) . Specific sequences of kicks and punches unlock & quot ; Arts & quot ; - combos that you can perform at any point in the game . Furthermore , you can chain Arts in combat if they share their first and last moves , and , what 's best , you can perform any Art at any given time , giving you total freedom in combat . Most Arts are learned through experimentation , while a few are taught to you by a variety of casual mentors . To save you the trouble of writing the arts down , the game keeps track of the ones you learned in notes that can be called up either through the status menus or directly in combat . Magic in Legend of Legaia is all summoning . During combat you have the chance of absorbing the powers of a variety of enchanted monsters , and thereupon summoning them to cast spells . If you summon the creature frequently , it will increase in level , making the spell it produces more efficient and perhaps even add a side effect.Seems as though Sony threw this amazing thing in and then forgot to capitalize on it . Makes me wonder why they capitalized on the far more restrictive battle engine in Legend of Dragoon.Graphically , Legend of Legaia is n't much to look at ( or listen to ) , with ungainly polygonal surroundings and fully polygonal characters who look like blocks on a string . Thankfully , in combat the characters are realistically proportioned and animate realistically . Also , their faces are very expressive and well-detailed.A diabolic mist has enveloped the world years ago , turning the enchanted Seru into deranged monsters , and their human possessors into mindless zombies . It is up to you to revive the Genesis trees spread across the land in order to destroy the mist . If the story sounds off-beat and unexciting , it is still your formulaic save-the-world story we have come to know and love in many RPGs . The plot is as unobtrusive as they come . There is nothing unnecessary , no confusing tangents , no bland , endless dialog , nothing to detract you from the gameplay.Now , to alerts : this is a slow , SLOW , S ... ... L ... ... O ... ... W game . Travel on the overworld is very sluggish . Character advancement is equally slow . Get ready for tactical level-building , lots of it , because the bosses are tough . If you like your games to move at breakneck speed and half-blind you with glitter of many explosions , Legend of Legaia may reduce you to tears in under an hour . But if you 're in for a good , old-fashioned RPG experience , you will most certainly enjoy this game .	1
my husband loved his birthday gift.. he played this when he was younger and due to a bad divorce from his ex wife he lost it . Now he has it back and we are building a collection together . He was impressed what I paid for it , and how great of a condition it was in when it arrived . Perfect condition , perfect working order . Would buy from this seller again .	1
Where do I begin ? The graphics are top-notch for the time it was released , and the environments vary from being colorful to plain dark with a very fitting soundtrack that hums perfectly with its perspective locations , and the controls are pretty solid , and you can even use the analog stick , which is pretty neat for a game that was originally released in Japan in 1998 with a 1999 US release . The enemies can be rather creepy , which adds to the overall appeal of it . The story is rather entertaining with plot twists that will keep the player going , and the idea of mist being such a poisonous element to the world seems interesting in itself as there are some deserted towns that were deserted from the movement of such a lethal element . The battles have various combinations that characters can use to defeat opponents , and some of the bosses will require having special moves to defeat them , as they can rake up in difficulty very quickly . Overall , I highly recommend this game to any RPG fan looking for an original story with exciting gameplay . My two cents .	1
Legend of Legaia is a relatively simple RPG with a new twist : now you can customize the way you attack your enemies . This makes it look sort of like a Tekken game , but it 's still menu-based.The story begins when Vagn , the main character with blue hair , is preparing to go hunting . Of course , like almost every RPG story that starts out with a plan , things take a turn for the worst : Vagn 's girlfriend 's father gets killed by monsters in THE MIST , then an evil entity invades Vagn 's village . Now Vagn must go on an adventure to stop the mist permanently . The guy who was killed is n't especially important ; Vagn is just sick of people dying.On his way , Vagn meets a young girl named Noa and an Akuma look-alike named Byron ( if I remember the name correctly ) . Sorry to cut off there , but you 'll have to play the game if you want to know more . It 's worth it though.What I especially like about Legend of Legaia is that it fits into the 32-bit era without sacrificing bizarre hair colors . This is very essential to anime , as it can somehow relax the nerves .	1
This is one of the best RPGs I ever played . It has a unique combat system that inputs how you 'll attack by using combos with you feet and both arms . Often you find a special move after using a specific combo that gives stronger attacks . I highly recommend this game to RPG lovers and Playstation 1 gamers .	1
One of the best fighting games of it 's era . I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys fighting games .	1
I do n't think this game is as well-known as other games , such as the Final Fantasy series , but it 's still a pretty good RPG . It 's not the best out there , but it 's really fun to play and is a solid entry in the RPG genre . Let 's find out why ! Graphics ( score 8/10 ) : The graphics kind of remind of Final Fantasy VII 's graphics , although I 'm not sure if they came out around the same time or what . They are n't really exciting by today 's standards , but they work well enough . Legend of Legaia may not have the best graphics , but it makes good use of what it has . In fact , the enemy designs and area settings are pretty unique and inventive . Overall , the graphics are n't too hard on the eye.Music ( score 8/10 ) : The music is pretty good , and somewhat memorable , especially the overworld theme . There is some limited voice acting in the form of battle phrases , most of which are in Japanese . Each character only has three moves that are voiced in English , which do n't even play every time you use that move ( it cycles randomly between that and the Japanese phrases ) . To make matters worse , the few English phrases like `` Tornado Fist '' sound a whole lot like butchered `` Engrish '' . I wonder what happened there . Were they not able to afford more than a few phrases voiced in English ? Or decent voice actors ? They really should 've kept it all English or all Japanese . Other than that though , I have no complaints in this category because the actual music is awesome.Characters ( score 6/10 ) : The characters themselves are not the best in RPG history . Firstly , we have Vahn , who never speaks and has no personality . Yep , it 's the old `` silent protagonist '' . The game even makes fun of this -- there 's a scene where Vahn steps into some hot water and turns red , then jumps back out , all without saying a word . Then , this guy walks over and says , `` if the water 's hot , you should say so '' . It 's hilarious . Next , we have Noa , who was literally raised by wolves ( well , a Seru creature attached to a wolf 's head ) . Because of this , she is socially awkward and knows nothing of the world . Unfortunately , this leads to some pretty cringe-worthy dialogue ( for example , a scene where she broadly proclaims that `` suffering is bad ! '' ) . To make matters worse , she speaks the most out of your three characters . Gala is your last character . I actually think he is the best developed since he starts out being an uptight stiff but later becomes more open-minded . Overall , these characters are not the greatest , but they get the job done.Story ( score 9/10 ) : You 'd think a game about reviving trees to save the world would be boring , but this game pulls it off . An evil mist has covered the land , causing the normally helpful Seru creatures to attack humanity . Your small party of heroes possess Ra-Seru , a type of Seru immune to the mist , and must save the world by reviving Genesis Trees , which have the power to drive away mist . No , this is n't Arbor Day propaganda . In all seriousness , though , the story is pretty engaging . It 's really interesting seeing how each isolated settlement of humans manages to protect themselves from the mist and who is ultimately responsible for the whole mist problem . The game developers have really done a good job of portraying a devastation-ridden world and keeping it engaging and believable.Battle System ( score 10/10 ) : The battle system is an interesting take on the usual turn-based system . You input a `` left , right , up , or down '' button in a string to make an attack . Certain combinations will be special attacks called `` arts '' which do more damage . If you get sick of inputting buttons , the game allows you to use your last input as a default . This option can speed things up if you just do n't feel like doing all those inputs . This battle system is actually more fun and engaging than a plain old `` attack '' command , and I really enjoyed it.Gameplay ( score 8/10 ) : This is a bit of a catch-all category for me . Now , the best aspect of this game , in my opinion , is collecting Seru to use as summon magic . If you have a collector 's mindset like me , you 'll really enjoy collecting them all . Unfortunately , this can be tedious and irritating since you odds of catching good Seru are usually low , forcing you to try over and over and over again . This really wears on your nerves after awhile . Usually though , it is n't so bad . Let 's see , other than that , no complaints ! Overall ( score 8/10 ) : NOTE this score is not an average ; it 's my subjective overall score . It 's really a shame that this game is n't more well-known because I feel like Legend of Legaia is a good solid little game . If you 're an RPG collector then this game is definitely worth putting in your collection .	1
Legend of Legaia was the first rpg I ever played which started my love for rpg 's . When I first played this game I could not put it down to eat , sleep or go to work . I called in 2 days in a row because of how addicted to this game I was . Anyways , to get to the review part and after beating this game 3x since and played many rpg 's it still holds as one of my all time favorites just under Lunar : SSSC , Final Fantasy VII , Grandia and Xenogears for the original playstation.Storyline : I still after all these years love the storyline to this game . Van , Gala and Noa are the only members in your party ( which after playing other rpg 's , I wished you had a few more people in your party ) . Basically there is a mist that turns people and animals into crazed monsters and you need to activate the Genesis trees and destroy mist generators . It has some really good twists in the story and it stays for the most part intersesting and keeps you hooked . Van is a quiet and just good all around guy , Noa is a girl who grew up on her own until she met Van and Gala is a monk who seems to be angry most of the time.Graphics : Definitely for its time some of the best around but there were no cg clips or fmv 's to help move the storyline on . With games around its time using cg clips , like FFVII , or anime scenes like Lunar , I think Legaia could have used some clips as well . As far as graphics when your characters were fighting , very nicely done , a bit blocky but when you buy armor and the change is actually noticeable on the character its a very easy to get over.Combat System : Probably the very best thing and most enjoyable part of the game , even the random battles are easy to get over because it actually get you into the fight . You get to do whats called `` arts '' , `` hyper arts '' and magic that is used through your Ra-Seru . Magic is learned by killing monsters but getting the actual spell is random so it can be on your first kill or 200th kill . The power of your magic goes up the more times you use it and the Kamero spell is easily my most favorite.The game can take anywhere from 50+ hours to finish depending on how much you do . There are a few mini games but none that are noteworthy and I only have few gripes about the game itself.The first is when roaming around on the world map Van moves really slow . Also , money is an annoyance to get and armor starts getting really expensive so you 'll spend a lot of time money grinding if you want the best stuff.The money grinding , lack of a few cg clips or fmv 's to help move the story and long levels keep this game from being one of the greatest rpg 's ever . It gets delightful 4 out 5 from this long time Legaia fan .	1
I bought this game when it first came out . I immediately loved the fighting style against enemies . This game reminds me so much of Final Fantasy VII for the PS and it is very similar in battles except for the ability to customize hitting attacks . That is the best part of this game . If you liked Final Fantasy VII , get this game . 5 Stars RPG Game , but the battles tend to take too long sometimes .	1
Once upon a time in a land so far away that character names are nothing like they are today , the Seru came to the world of Legaia . Man discovered that he could use these benevolent creatures to wield tremendous powers . All was well . Or as well as it could be in a world where war was a commonplace and , sooner or later , someone figured out how to pervert the power of the Seru and turn them to evil . Those who wore the Seru became degenerate , and the world cowered before the onslaught of the mist.Of course , the powers that write games could n't leave an opportunity like this alone , and our heroes , Vahn the young hunter , Gala the monk , and Noa , an eleven year old girl with the power of 10 were packed off to end the mist , wearing special symbionts , the Ra-Seru . Their first task , to restore the great trees of the world.This is a classic PS-One RPG . Not one of the greatest , but with enough play in it to keep your interest for the 40 to 60 hours it takes to play . The story line is straightforward - the long story arc is broken into a set of subquests , either the restoration of a tree or the destruction of a mist generator . The world is large , and you will spend a lot of time walking about in perpetual battle until faster modes of tranportation become available.The battle system is based on combination attacks which can be layered together in increasing power . Magic is available via the Ra-Seru , who can absorb powers when certain foes are beaten . Like many systems , fighting can be as complex as you might like , but the truth is that you will find certain patterns that work consistently and those are what you will use . This is a flaw in most RPG 's - power always trumps subtlety.The game 's only glaring flaw is that it is entirely too much a money game . You start out poor and stay that way , since no matter how many you kill , your funds always lag the prices until late in the game , when a variety of sub-games become available to generate cash and prizes . There is something vaguely unsatisfying about putting saving the world on hold in order to go 30 round in a boxing ring to get the cash for that nifty magic grail . Now every RPG has this problem , but in Legaia it is worse than usual.My other gripe is the characters . Vahn and Gala are extremely two dimensional ( Gala has a slight sense of humor ) . Noa , who gets most of the story development time , is a hyperactive , bloodthirsty eleven-year-old girl who is perpetually waving her arms and giving orders . She is also a stone killer . She may get my prize as the silliest hero to grace the Playstation.Graphics are decent for the game 's era , but music is a washout . This is a decent game , with fairly enjoyable play , but do n't expect Final Fantasy level quality . If you like RPG 's as a genre , then you will find the game entertaining for many hours .	1
And this is coming from someone who has played so many other RPG games including the very impressive Legend of Dragoon and also of course the famous Final Fantasy games.The characters for one are quite memorable . Let 's take Noa first . She eventually will become , if not your strongest , then second strongest in the entire group . Her speed is superior over the men 's and thus makes her deliver some hard hits . She became my best fighter and unlike others she was my favorite character . Many here say that Noa is annoying but honestly people she was raised her whole life in a cave without any human contact . Of course she does n't understand how to behave in public how could she ? So I think reviewers should cut the game some slack with her since they 're just trying to make her realistic.Gala is a great fighter due to his body strength . He eventually hits the hardest and does great damage to the enemies . Gala himself is a rather interesting character as well . At first he does n't warm up to either Vahn and Noa , but only because of his extreme dislike for seru and anyone who wears them . When he finds out how special Ra- Seru though , he warms up and becomes a willing and actually humorous character.Vahn is the one you have to control . He only speaks what you choose for him to say but everyone loves him . He 's the nice guy and a good fighter as well . He 's not as quick as Noa , or as strong as Gala , but nonetheless when you get his levels up he can be a great fighter as well.Now for the game itself , it is a very fun , and long game . If you 're not patient enough to last through a long video game then you better steer clear of this game . It took me 70 hours to finish it and that 's mainly because every town that was filled with the Mist I stuck around before saving it to level up a bit more . Some people I notice complain of how hard the bosses are . I found none of the bosses truly hard at all- even the final boss I did not break a sweat over . Maybe because I have played so many other RPGs that they were easy , but I think even someone not really into RPGs could easily beat the bosses of the game . It 's just I think a lot of people did n't level up as much as they should have . At the very end of the game I was at level 52 for my group and that was more than enough for me to beat the game.Leveling up can be a pain once all three characters get to higher levels , but the bosses are easy to beat as long as you level up a few in every Mist- filled town . So I advise gamers to do so . Also leveling up the magic creatures your Ra- Seru takes in as is very easy and necessary- just use them frequently in battle and they will easily level up in no time.Also it is smart to level up anyway to get a lot of money . Because I do agree with one complaint- the weapons in this game cost a lot of money eventually . I think the point is to fight a lot so you do n't have a money problem- but I do agree the weapons still , especially towards the end of the game , get to be too pricey . Just fight a bit , or even sell an accessory you do n't wear , and you will eventually find the money for them.The plot and subplots of this game is what keeps you overall entertained . I wo n't repeat what the Amazon review already has wrote out so well , but the basic goal throughout the game is to destroy the Mist all over the world by reviving Genesis trees and destroying Mist generators . Along the way many interesting characters come along and you fight a few and help a few.The best part of the game is definitely the outfits though the three get to wear . The new weapons and armor they wear are always different in appearance and visually appealing . Noa 's outfits are especially beautiful . It 's worth the money I think to pay for them.So overall this is a long and very creative game . The storylines throughout the game connect well and the plot itself unravels well as you go along . The characters are likeable and as said before the battle scenes are visually appealing and fun . The levels do take awhile as you get up to higher numbers , but you do not need at all to get anywhere near level 99 . As said before , I beat the game easily at level 52 . I would say the only really minor negative parts are the long levels and amount of money for armor- other than that , this game is a true joy . Highly recommend for people who like games such as Final Fantasy.5/5	1
I remember this game a long time ago that I played for hours over and over again . This game was so much fun . I know that it had it faults , but it was n't that bad and it was pretty fun . I liked the drawings of characters and the animation . If you like FF7 kind of graphics than this is the same kind . I like the battle system . Yes , this game has a similar battle system as Xenogears and that 's why I liked it too . It 's not a bad thing that they used a similar battle system , it 's a great thing , as now I got 2 games that play the same with different people and story lines.The main story is that you control 3 characters and they all have a magic gem that attach to their arm . This give them the ability to use magic/summon spells . I remember as a little kid , I loved seeing those spells come out . The fault in this game with that is it takes awhile to get the spells . You have to get hit repeatedly with the same spell for awhile before the each character learns it.Another issue with this game is that their is a issue with money . I had to fight many battles before I could get enough to buy anything . It 's like this for the whole game . I did n't mind this as I had to fight monster anyways to learn those summon spells.What I really liked about this game was the little mini games . I remember playing one mini game for a long time as the fishing game . I remember there was 2 or 3 places where I could fish and I had to get better rods to get better fish . I would keep on fishing for some reason I would get something for getting a fish that weight a lot of pounds . Also , I would get something for getting really rare fish . I remember one time , I got the most impossible and rarest fish in the whole game . It took half a hour of reeling it in and even longer trying to find and wait for it . That sucker was so much trouble to get , but I knew it was worth it . I do n't remember the name , but it was a really long sliver/white fish that weighted a ton ! It game is worth it , if you gave the time it needs to get really good towards the middle or the game and at the end too .	1
I already had this game back in 2001 but lent it to a friend and never got it back so I have already played it and decided to get it again and I have to say It 's by far my favorite PSone Game ever . The # 1 reason I love this game is the execution of the Super , Hyper , and Miracle arts . I have a few other reasons but I 'm only listing the first one .	1
In 1999 everyone had gotten all excited about Final Fantasy VIII ( what a mistake that was ) while THIS game would be the one to keep RPGers satisfied until then . While it clearly is n't that remarkable for the new generation , Legend of Legaia was every RPGers dream . A rich well thought out Battle system with an excellent storyline to boot . Not only that but the game was extremely difficult . A vast world full of sidequests and mini games as well as one of the hardest optional bosses in RPG HISTORY ! First the graphics . This was probably one of the last RPGs made to use the blocky polygons , but the graphics were exquisite . Especially in battle . When seeing characters in battle the game actually viewed your characters in full armor ! If you took armor off and placed on a different armor it showed ! When did Final Fantasy do THAT ? Outside of battle the graphics are colorful and towns are nice and easy to navigate.Now for what I think made Legend of Legaia pretty interesting as far as RPGs go . The battle system was probably one of the best battle systems I saw . First you selected to fight in a battle . Then with each character you selected several chains to connect together to form a combo ( think of Street Fighter ) . You watch them perform the combo and do an art technique that consumed AP . The only way to gain your AP back was to be attacked , attack without using arts or to select a command called & quot ; Spirit & quot ; ( which replaces what we often call & quot ; Defend & quot ; or & quot ; Guard & quot ; ) . The only flaw with this system ? Well gaining AP takes longer than it actually sounds and for that battles get to be VERY long . Boss battles can take as long as an hour because of this.The storyline is that God created humans . But the humans were unable to fend off monsters that covered the land . So God gave them a power in which to aid them . It was called the seru . Humans grew reliable on Seru and began to do things that they otherwise could n't do . Things such as fly , or become incredibly strong . But one day that came to an end when out of nowhere the mist covers the land in which the humans live on . The mist causes the seru to go insane and attack the humans casuing disaster in the land of Legaia . Thus the Legend begins ! Learning magic was n't entirely original but it was different from what I was used to . You were bestowed with a Ra-Seru and when you attacked certain enemies they would either die or they would turn into a magic spell for you to keep . This was a great idea but learning magic is very annoying at times when you must fight the same enemies over and over again.My cons with the game . The character developement is pretty bad . The characters do n't act their age . It 's nice that they have a background on them though . So I guess these characters are developed in some ways but they 're very unbelievable . The other con is that while the game is difficult it get 's disturbingly easy as you go through ... well somewhat . EVERY MOMENT in this game before the Final Boss is really hard ... then you get to that final boss and he 's so incredibly easy . Another bad thing about the game is that there is this hidden boss named Lapis who does several points of damage to you . This is one of the hardest bosses in Legend of Legaia and possibly RPG history . What makes it bad though is that the reward for defeating him is nothing special so of course defeating the boss is only for bragging rights.The music in this game is superb . The moment is always set and the music makes you feel as if you 're in a fantasy . A type of music that I do n't always get . The game is also full of mini games and sidequests as well . Not only that but the way the story unfolds is by far one of the best ways to tell this kind of story . At first it seems like a cliche but it 's much more than that.OverallThe good+INCREDIBLE Battle system+Great story+Cool grapchis+Great music+Lots of mini games and sidequests+A hard game+An epic adventureThe bad-Stuff is too expensive ( Not mentioned above ) -Characters lack-Battles can get really long .	1
Memory is what you need to even begin playing with your nintendo 64 for two reasons . First you cant play Zelda without it . Second , because if you want to continue in a game with levels saving it will help . Nintendo 64 memory is a high price although if you buy another version of memory it may not work . Paying more is better thatn paying for a new system if it breaks .	1
The expansion pak is the best thing since sliced bread . It is the item that revived the 64 after Dreamcast ( RIP ) debuted . It makes the graphics even more superior , finally putting the PSX to shame . It also helped to create enormous games , such as the excellent Majora 's Mask and Perfect Dark . But here 's the twist . If you do n't allready have a pak or Donkey Kong 64 , I would suggest you purchased them as a bundle at the very low price of ... , a steal from the Expansion Pak at ... .ac	1
I extremely recommend this , especially for the games that have come out lately , which may run slow without it . Other games wo n't even let you play the full version enless you have an expansion pack . I speeds up the game speed and raises the graphic quality by a lot . It makes a dramatic difference to your game . Go and buy it today .	1
This is my favorite accesoory . It will make the graphics of dsome games better and all this other cool stuff . FFor some games you need it no matter what like Donkey Kong 64 .	1
For any post Zelda : OoT N64 hit this device is a must have .	1
Great product , glad Nintendo decided to come out with it . Boosts RAM for the 64 , which greatly improves gameplay .	1
ill start with the goods first of all its nice having this little gadget for ur N64 for games like The Legend of Zelda : Majoras Mask that requires u to have it and Perfect Dark where u practically need it to get the most out of the gameplay now the few bad things its a little difficult to get out the original jumperpak with the cheap plastic thingy they give you and for some of the games there are n't much improvements with it they have pretty much the same graphics as the jumperpak but with like hydro thunder then u can have 4 players instead of 2 or 3 ( i forget which 1 it is cause i do n't own the game i just saw the reviews off of nintendo magazines	1
For anyone who still owns or wants to buy a N64 you simply MUST have the expansion pack.Banjo TooieDonkey Kong 64 all made great use of the pack.More ram.Bigger and more colorful worlds.It pretty much does exactly what the description says.Granted the older N64 games do n't make use of it but the newer games do.A no brainer and a must have.Highly recommended .	1
This makes the N64 graphics look like PS2 . Too bad not all the games are compatible with this . Plus it adds 4MB more to your memory card and improves graphics sound . If u want one of these get the ones nintendo made . If u want the most out of your N64 , look for this where ever u can . U will not regret it .	1
( Note : I 'm writing this for the Expansion Pak produced by Tomee . These third party expansion paks seem to hover together in the same listing . So just keep that in mind if you go taking my advice . ) If I 'm not mistaken , this is an aftermarket expansion pak . I 've heard some bad things about the Tomee controllers floating around , but the expansion pak actually seems to work pretty well . I bought one produced by InterAct ( a more reputable third-party manufacturer ) years ago , and there 's no apparent difference in quality . As I 've never owned the Nintendo version of the expansion pak , I ca n't really say how it compares to the first party quality . However , there should n't really be any difference . It 's just RAM . : )	1
Now I can play four man matches in WWF No Mercy without considerably low frame rate and lag . Great product and shipped fast .	1
This expansion pack allows you to play better games and increases the graphics on the N64.A+++	1
i just bought an n64 , but i 've played one before with and without the expansion pak . though the pak does help with the graphics the n64 still ca n't touch the dreamcast or ps2 with regards to graphics . still the pak does let you play perfect dark so it is a must have .	1
This is a needed tool for the Gameshark Pro and certain games like Zelda . If you do not need it , pick it up for a little extra detail in all of your games . It makes everything look great and it stops the slowdown that games like No Mercy have .	1
I bought this expansion pak for a N64 that I picked up at a thrift store and it works great . You need this accessory if you plan on playing some of the more graphic-intensive N64 games .	1
Getting this new was the best way for me . Ca n't play Majora 's Mask without it : D Plus its a good find for us who still play the Nintendo 64 games	1
MY N64 restarted for no reason every now and again and the Xpack fixed that . Totally worth owning if you own any of the later N64 titles.Its totally worth it for the High rez version of EP1 racer and the ability to play DK64 and PD .	1
The expansion pack beefs up the graphics capability of the standard Nintendo 64 Unit . This in itself should make any gamer run out and grab one - when you compare the price of this to the price of one of the new consoles , you 're saving tons of money ! What does it do ? For some games that work both with and without the expansion pack , it greatly increases the types of graphics shown during gameplay . Pod Racer is a stellar example . Play without the pack , and you get rings and blocky graphics . Add in the pack and you suddenly have lens flare , details of ships racing beside you , crucial information about upcoming turns . It makes the game play the way the developers intended.It 's like watching The Matrix on a shoddy VHS tape copied from a friend , and then seeing it on DVD . It 's an amazing difference for a very low price.In addition , many new games coming out are so graphic-intensive that they require the expansion pack to even play . The Legend of Zelda : Majora 's Mask is a key example . This is an EXCELLENT game with great extended gameplay , but you ca n't even start if you do n't have this pack in place.It 's not difficult to install - you simply plug it in once and it stays there permanently . You can still play older games with it in place . If you 're paying $ 60 for games , why not pay out for this expansion that will make them all play better , and give you access to the newer games ?	1
This red pak is intended for expending RAM space for N64 games , I strongly recommend it for a gamers ' enjoyment .	1
Must have for certain games like Legend of Zelda Majora 's Mask ! It is required or you will not be able to play the game at all . Supposed to enhance graphics for all games as well .	1
If you have an N64 you must get an Expansion Pak . The Expansion Pak increases the graphics and the speed of some of the newers games on the N64 . Some of the newest one 's will not play with out it . Like some people have said this is just like adding RAM to a PC . It 's easy and fast and I 've had no problems with mine . If you have an N64 buy an expansion pak . You will not regret it .	1
I know the kids needed this for something but dont know why . I believe its still working as they still play 64	1
well if you need it and your games require it or just want a boost of video memory in your N64 then get this it helps : D	1
Make sure you check to see you 've got the RAM expansion in your N64 . If you have n't , go ahead and order one . A lot of great games require it , like Perfect Dark and Donkey Kong 64 . It is n't groundbreaking technology or anything , but it 's one of those things like guns , condoms , first aid kits , or umbrellas - better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it .	1
I needed this to play Majora 's Mask , I 'm glad I could find one with a reasonable price even 15 years later . Several late-N64 games need one of these , if your game is one of these than here ya go !	1
you get what you came for , its an expansion pak to play larger n64 games and it makes all your other n64 games run smoother . N64 looks cool now that its got a red hood ornament haha	1
and it makes the Turok 2 and 3 look better . If you have an N64 and want to experience some of the best it has to offer than this expansion pack is essential .	1
It 's cheap , it 's memory , so it 's excellent ! Memory always does a good job to any game/software , and you can see that by Donkey Kong 64 , International Superstar Soccer 2000 , Zelda : Majora 's Mask and other great games that support the Expansion Pack.Do n't waste your time , if you pretend to continue playing Nintendo 64 games , you will need to gear up !	1
It works like the one for the N64 . It 's a little bit bigger that you 're not able to put the cover back on the N64 . I have n't tried it yet with Perfect Dark and any other games that require the expansion pack . It 's alright though .	1
Such a necessity that once I received it for Christmas I got rid of the Jumper Pak for good.The Expansion pak holds MUCH more memory.If you have games that need it ask mom and dad night and day to buy you an Expansion Pak.You really have no need for the Jumper Pak.The Jumper Pak is really hard to get out anyway.I had to use a knife to get the Jumper Pak out which cant be too good for the system but what the hey now the Expansion Pak is in and I dont need to worry anymore .	1
The Nintendo 64 memory expansion pak upgrade is not vital for the most part , in terms of plugging up and playing many of the great titles already released for this console . But there are a few titles that absolutely require this upgrade . The Legend of Zelda Majora 's Mask and Donkey Kong 64 are two such titles for example , that can not be accessed without this upgrade . Perfect Dark is one such title which offers minimal gameplay and locks players out of many of it 's richer features due to the lack of available memory to run all of it 's features properly . But I think you 'll find that even if Donkey kong 64 , Perfect dark , or Zelda Majora 's Mask is n't your thing , you 'll still be wanting to consider purchasing this Ram expansion for a few key reasons.1 ) Improved gameplay details . A lot of games weather you know this or not offer very fine gameplay oriented details not available without extended memory . Most games are capable of improved framerate ( improves quality of onscreen action . Prevents slow down effects when a lot of on screen action is occuring for example . ) Programers can implement more textures and details to environments and characters making things look more lively or life like . AI ( artificial intelligence ) can be improved and become `` smarter '' .2 ) The second drastic improvement is audio/visual quality . Most people that do n't understand how computer games really work or do n't know all the technical terms , have a commen misconception that this expansion pak is supposed to improve the graphics in a way that might take the console beyond it 's 64 bit capabilities . This is n't true . Rather , the expansion pak improves color quality and helps to reduce the blurry effect of the colors in most games , creating better visual clarity . Much of the blocky character sprites ( but not all of course ) will appear smooth and less blockish or choppy . With the improved framerate you may even notice how the environment in some games can pan out further while maintaining a smooth look , allowing the player to see further away from the character than they could with the jumper pak ... .The memory expansion for N64 is relatively cheap now that the console itself is two generations removed behind Gamecube and Wii . And if your still into retro gaming or just enjoy playing the Nintendo 64 even after all these years I would certainly recommend this buy . Even if you never play the games which require the upgrade , I would consider this because of it 's ability to enhance visual clarity . Couple the memory expansion up with a Video-S cable , and you will still find an appeal to the outdated graphics of a system of yore .	1
Some of the coolest new games coming out are going to require this to play so you better get yourself one now . It will be well worth it . It 'll soup up some older games that are made to work with it as well .	1
An expansion pack is essential as more and more games are coming out where you need to use the expansion pack . The expansion pack improves graphics on games like South Park and Star Wars and is essential to play games like Zelda Majoras Mask and Perfect Dark . The graphics are greatly improved that if you put two monitors together with one having a nintendo with an expansion pack and one without an expansion pack you would be able to see the difference . Dont miss out on some of the best games about at the moment , buy an exoansion pack and enjoy	1
I must admit , I was a tad dissapointed that we had to buy this thing in order to play some games for the N64 . Not that many require it , but the best games DO require it to get the best performance out of it . As the days of Nintendo went by , so did the games and so did my endless day in the house and not leaving it , to play with my N64 . I 've come to the realization that the PAK does help out much with many games that do n't even require it . A fact that you might not know about the expansion pak is that it does , in fact , help every N64 game out there , however , not all of them take in the dramatic effect that it has to offer . Games not designed for it , wo n't use it as much or as well as games that do work with it will , however , little things can be improved . As with the N64 Expansion Pak , I 've noticed that many games ( designed for it ) work more than well on the system and are greatly improved . As the fact that Nintendo is pushing out games that now require it ( Majora 's Mask , DK64 ) it is vital to have it . A tad pricey , yes , but beneficial all the same .	1
Lots of games require this to be installed so it is a MUST . 5 stars because it is needed to play one of the Zeldas !	1
Works great , just like any N64 expansion pak . Nothing much to really say about it . It 's a good product and if you have an N64 , you should definitely get one . Increases RAM from 4MB to 8MB which basically means better graphics and more visually appealing games .	1
when i bought my N64 i really suffered for games , it seem like no one had N64 the games , EVENTUALLY i was able to aquire game like Doom N64 / Duke Nuken ect ... .. with less than ordinary graphics in comparison to when i got my memory epansion , Then came games like Donkey Kong 64 , Perfect dark , Zelda Majaora 's Mask , well let say that i really was impress to see the full potential of the N64 , i always wondered why ? ? ? for the power that N64 had it was hard to see how Ps1 was so much more popular than N64 , i know N64 had some really great games and the graphic was superior to Ps1 , anyhow if you are a serious gamer the expansion pak is a must have and also you can experience the full potential of the N64 laterzzzz folks / gamers ... ..	1
I still remember as a kid on my Birthday when my Dad bought me a N64 with a bunch of games including Donkey kong & a few months ago I bought the N64 from one of my old friends and a while after I bought Donkey kong and other games at a flea market but I had forgotten that to play Donkey Kong it required the Expansion Pak so I came here Bought it hoping that it would arrive and surely it did , all it came in was in one of those Orange envelope things & it was n't even wrapped in anything when I opened it it was just right there but it 's cool cause at least the inside was insulated with Bubble wrap , kept it safe & it looked Brand New . I 'm just Happy now that I can play again one of the games I played when I was like around 8 years old and now I 'm 19 .	1
simply awesome . if you havent already played it , get it , youre gauranteed to love it . its the birth of spectacular stealth adventures . and you can buy it for as little as three dollars on amazon and it will play on playstation 2 .	1
Following the popularity of Metal Gear Solid , Syphon Filter is a game that stands up very well on its own . It has enough that is different that it can be considered a very good game in its own right . SF has a very nice blend of shoot-em-up and stealth missions that it is never the same thing over and over . However , it does find a few things lacking . The save system is horrendous . You can only save at points that are very far apart . The checkpoint system which allows you to restart at the last checkpoint helps this a little , but being able to save a checkpoints would have made this game much better . Also , some scenarios are very difficult , especially if you 've been playing it through and miss one detail . Most likely , it 's a detail that you will miss everytime , which can make a few missions very frustrating . The cut scenes are good and the game control is good . The wide variety of weapons is very interesting as well . All in all , this is a very good game marred by a very few flaws .	1
Arrived in a timely manner and in great condition . No problems with the game and thoroughly enjoyed playing it . Recommended to those who grew up with the PS1 .	1
During one of my many ventures to my local game store a year and a half ago , I came across a game called `` Syphon Filter '' . Intrigued , I went ahead and bought it , popped it in my Psone , and to this day , it is one of the best games I have ever played . I have beat the 1st , 2nd and 3rd , and am on my second `` pass '' through the series . I will then give the `` Omega Strain '' a go on my PS2 once I am finished with SF3 . While I have read no so favorable reviews on OS , I think it would be fair to at least give it a try.You are `` Gabe '' Logan , a special operative for a super secret government orginization aptly named `` The Agency '' . Your mission is to find a dangerous chemical stolen by terrorists from a lab and stop them before they destroy the world . You are remotely partnered with Lian Xing , another agent who guides you through your missions and later on in the game is in action on the ground.You are gradually given an arsenal of weapons as each level moves forward . Among them are : There is the Silenced 9mm handgun , the .45 handgun , the G-18 Pistol-machine Gun , , the HK-5 Pistol Machine Gun , the Shotgun , the Combat Shotgun , the PK-102 Assault Rifle , the M-16 Assault Rifle , and the K3G4 Assault Rifle just to name a few.In each mission based level , you must accomplish a variety of objectives , and eliminate a tough boss at different intervals . You will use stealth at times , or just face enemies head on . The interesting part about this game is that it really draws you in , and takes some interesting twists and turns as it progresses.As for gameplay , it is fantastic and addicting . While the levels are challenging and tough at times , they are not overly frustrating or extremely hard . Some levels and missions are easy , and others will take a few times to get through . It will be a bit of a challenge if you play this for the first time , but you wo n't become overwhelmed as in similar games . As you play it a second and third time , though , you will become familiar with the layout of the levels and more or less breeze through . As an example , I was able to shoot down the chopper on the base tower after 5 tries , as opposed to 30 attempts during my first run through the game over a year ago . You will also attain some `` tricks '' along the way as well , such as becoming more effective at headshots and so on . I have found that it 's the `` little '' things that get you through this game.As for game layout and graphics , excellent , IMO for 1999 PS1 . Great voice animations and camera angles as well.While there are many new games out , especially in the wake of the XBOX 360 and PSP releases , I still encourage you to give this masterpiece a try . You wo n't be disappointed .	1
Syphon Filter is a good 3rd person shooter with stealth elements . People have to remember that this was one of the early 3d games that tried to incorporate stealth elements , so it is not as smooth as some of today 's games , but it is still pretty well done in my opinion . The game has its flaws , but was a very fun game and the difficulty was just right . Not too easy and the boss fights were pretty sweet and did require multiple attempts on my part . I have the disc version for the PS1 , so I can not comment on the digital version .	1
Syphon Filter is a awesome game it was pretty advance in stealth reminded me of mg and splinter cell i only wish they would remake it and the others for ps3 with updated graphics	1
This is one of the classics here . Same as Syphon Filter 2 . I loved this game 12 years ago and I wanted to buy it and play it again . It 's fantastic with the rollings and all the weapons.Great game !	1
This game is indeed what started it all . The graphics were great , considering its an early PSOne release . The storyline is a bit farfetched and predictable , but likeable ( and face it , you 've seen worse ) . The controls are extremely easy to work with , the missions are satisfactory , and you get to shoot ppl . What more do you want ?	1
The game is excellent . The plot is good . I mean , what can be better than a deadly poison killing people ? But the graphics could have been infinitly better . The faces are flat , and have hardly any detail , and that is in the movie scenes ! The graphics are esspecially bad in gameplay . The guns , well let me just say it leaves more to be desired . Blood is extremly fake looking , but there is tons of it ! But the actual play itself is very fun.Now for the sound . Music is okay . Gun fire sounds are awesome . But the one thing that could have been changed are the voice overs . As soon as one is finished speaking , the other one cuts in right away . Not a very big deal , but it wears on after awhile.Graphics 3/10Sound 7/10Gameplay 10/10Blood Content 9/10Overall 7/10	1
The Good : A lot of excelent guns , decent story with memorable characters , genius level design , tight controls and camera , varied objectives and localesThe Bad : Flimsy stealth , some levels are confusing , a little shortThird person shooters were n't very frequent on PS1 and when they did come by they were usually pretty bad . Syphon Filter proved that you can make this genre work on the PS1 . The game is still really fun today and was way ahead of its time . A well done camera , great lock-on system , a decent story with memorable characters , a kick-ass arsenal of guns , and genius level design . Who would have thought a third person shooter would be this good in the late 90 & # 8242 ; s ? Eidetic and 989 Studios did.You play as super spy Gabriel Logan who is a CIA agent trying to stop a dangerous terrorist named Eric Rhoemer . A Syphon Filter virus that targets specific DNA demographics has been created by a man named Phagan and it is up to you to shut down their operations and stop them from spreading the virus . You start out in New York with the streets being shot up by Rhoemer 's thugs . There are objectives in each level to complete , but it is way beyond throw this switch , pull this lever , or shoot this amount of bad guys . You usually have to kill a certain amount of scientists , administer vaccines to victims , disarm bombs , turn off power grids . The objectives vary , but what is fun is figuring out how to get there.Syphon Filter has some of the most memorable levels I can remember . This is a game you play several times and remember where every enemy is , every crate location , and even how to kill each enemy . The levels vary with stealth sections , climbing , and timed areas . The game features a smart lock-on system because there is no camera control . It is surprisingly smart and follows you wherever you go . Enemies wearing flak jackets can only be taken out with head shots or very powerful weapons . This requires aiming in first person mode and taking them out . This flak jacket element is a staple of the series and will go on to be in every game . It is actually an element all on its own and not just body armor for you or the enemy . You can die very easily and if you do n't stop and aim for head shots you will waste ammo and/or die very quickly.There are a couple of boss fights thrown in such as a helicopter midway and Rhoemer himself at the end . I found all gameplay elements to be evenly tossed up so you are never bored . The stealth elements need a bit of work and are probably the worst thing about the game , but it is very minor . Crouching and sneaking around works fine , but enemies tend to see you at unknown distances . Maybe a line of sight cone on the radar would help this . You also have to get in head shots otherwise they wo n't die right away and alert other guards.Weapon selection is also a bit flimsy because you have to hold down select and use L2 and R2 ( strafe buttons ) to select the weapon . I would have preferred a radial menu instead . Some levels can be a bit hard to navigate are too dark to see . Thankfully you get a flashlight you can equip because some levels are nearly pitch black . I found myself lost a few times because even though the level design is fantastic , some levels can look the same with confusing hallways and misplaced crates and boxes.I actually learned about weapons as a kid from this game . Real world weapons are in here and some that I have never seen in any other game before . The weapons are almost a character all on their own because they feel so good to shoot in the game . The K3G4 will cut through flak jackets easily and is probably the only weapon that will do this . The G18 is a super fast sub-machine pistol , while the silenced 9mm is a staple of the series . The shotgun , combat shotgun , PK-102 , BIZ-2 , Nightvision Rifle , .45 , HK5 , and a few more are all excellent weapons . It was also the distinct sounds the developers used that make these guns so memorable . The game has a great sniper scope that was unseen in games back then . There are grenades and gas grenades which are great for taking out a group of enemies stealthily . There are a lot of great weapons in the game and they are very memorable unlike most shooters.While the game itself is amazing the graphics were pretty good at the time . Looking pretty realistic art wise , the game had some good lighting effects and a lot of detail everywhere . I also have many fond memories of this game as a kid . I actually accidentally rented Silent Hill because I forgot the name of this game . I got all the way to the Pharcom Warehouse levels and had to turn the game in . I rented this game many times over and played it to death as a kid . I purchased it a few times here and there and every time I play this it brings back fond memories . Syphon Filter is one of the greatest games ever made and every gamer should play this masterpiece .	1
And you 're the chosen one for thisPros : Missions are very fun to playNice aresonal of weapons ( K3G4 will rip through those flak jackets ) Very adictive gameplayPretty good musicThis game will last for a whileSuperb sound effectsBosses put up a pretty good fightaltho I do n't like to cheat , it 's a easy way to get all the levels and guns ( with infinite ammo ) put it on hard to push your skills to the limitat 19 bux , go grab a classicCons : Not so good graphics ( Faces are flat in FMVs ) I hate some stealth missionsVoice acting is pretty badSome missions are repetitveWhy does gabe run like he got ta crap his pantsThis game was definitly overshadowed by the imfamus Metal Gear Solid . But that do n't mean the game did n't sell , it reached the over the two million mark , and after playing it through , I see why . If you love Metal Gear Solid , go check this out.Final Words : This game was great , no doubt , but Syphon Filter 2 was a bit worse , and it missed out on the Combat shotgun ( Do n't get me wrong , it 's still a good game , not as good as the first . Now I dunno why they put out Syphon Filter 3 , that game stinks . Now the 're putting the climax of the series on the PS2 , Syphon Filter , omega strain online . Let 's just hope omega strain can be as fun as this classic.Peace	1
I loved playing this game back in 1999 , so I decided to buy it to have it on my game collection . This game has lots of action , stealth , strategy and the plot is awesome ! Id recommend it !	1
this is one of the game that u will remember for the rest of your life , the game is really fun the tutorial guide really helps the auto targetting is good but not perfect and this game is actually lot easier than its other parts.GRAPHICS 7/10 the characters look kind of flat and enviroment could have been a little more polishedSOUND 8/10 the background music to the bullets really coolcontrols 9/10 good but kind of twitchy in tight spotsOVERALL this game is just fun to play the story and the gamelay is awesome	1
This game is fun for the exact opposite reason that Metal Gear Solid is fun . In this game stealth is n't of much importance , while quickly killing all the bad guys on the screen is important . Like most action games this one is staged out into many different missions , which usually have five or six objectives in order throughout the level . My personal favorite aspect of this game is the target system which locks on to the enemy of your choice making the game easier in a crowded room of enemies . Syphon Filter is one great pure action game .	1
No complaints here , some parts of it became rather frustrating however . A nice venture into a new series , too bad it was slowed down by poor story telling in later games .	1
The original Syphon Filter trilogy set the standard to what the arcade style military third person shooter was to be on that generation of console . Whether you 're an old school collector or someone thats looking to properly emulate old school games on a PC this game is one every good boy and girl should have .	1
Syphon filter is a notch lower than Metal Gear solid . I mean , after a masterpiece like Metal Gear Solid , there is no way you ca n't compare any espionage games to it . The plot is shaky , and it 's missing that smart dialouge . But it 's a fun shoot-em-up game . So , by all means , get it .	1
I got this game years ago for Christmas , I do n't play it much but it does deliver what it 's supposed to : a fun casual racing game . The stages and vehicles you unlock in the game are actually pretty cool and have many unique designs to them . The racing never really feels tedious , and has the usual fun , arcade-style racing . It never gets old to watch your VW bug shatter to pieces when it flips over or goes over a cliff . There are numerous passageways in the stages which manages to keep things fresh and entertaining . Why a 7.25 rating ? The music is the biggest draw and flaw of the game because it 's very boring to listen to ( So just listen to your own music when playing this game ) , and the controls feel a bit glitchy during certain segments of the game . But , this game does offer a nice form of entertainment for an afternoon or a few hours of playing the game . If you like out of the ordinary racers Beetle Adventure Racing is for you .	1
This game rocks the most . Quite possibly the best racing game for the N64 , Beetle Adventure Racing packs so much into a single game pak that you wonder just what exactly does go on inside of that cartridge . Unlike other N64 racing games , BAR look just as darn good as anything you 'd find on many Dreamcast games . The graphics are lush . Plus , there 's stuff going on off of the track . Trains go by , warehouses operate and some freaky looking pumpkin things dance around . It offers much more to look at than , say , any Crusin ' title . The control is superb , even the poor handling cars are a blast to play with . There 's a Goldeneye multiplayer rip off where your car is outfitted with missles and bombs and the such . you get to go around collecting beetles which is just an excuse to kick the living daylights out of your annoying kid brother . Not that we : cough : ever do that .	1
Racing is my favorite genre and this is my favorite racing game . The controls are grab and go with no fine points of control . Something about them all being VW Bugs makes it appealing instead of boring . Driving in the slush and snow here approaches the feel of real driving in snow ie planning turns .	1
Electronic Arts was one of a small group of third party developers that supported the N64 with a decent amount of games . One of them , Beetle Adventure Racing , was exclusive to the system and proved to be one of the best racing games to grace the Nintendo 64 . Released in 1999 , it was an arcade racer with the physics seen in serious racers but poked fun at itself all throughout the game.In BAR , you pick from a variety of Volkswagen Beetles and choose from one player mode ( single and championship ) , two player mode ( race only ) and beetle battle mode ( two to four players . ) Select from one of six tracks ( first one only available from the start . ) and you 're off ! There are tons of stuff to unlock and the only way to get everything is by playing through the championship mode and beating the four difficulty levels . As you pass each track , it becomes available in the other game modes . As you beat the game under each difficulty level , you unlock additional versions of Beetles . There are `` number '' boxes scattered throughout each track . They count as points and need to be collected to earn `` continues '' and depending on the difficulty level , you need a certain amount . You can earn up to 100 points ; collect them all and you unlock a multi-player track for the Beetle Battle mode ( only one track is available from the start ) Lastly , there are `` flower '' boxes hidden throughout each track . Finding them unlocks cheats that you can turn on and off under the options screen.The PROS : There is so much content packed in this game , you get your money 's worth instantly . First off , the graphics , music , sound effects , controls and game play are impressive for a racing game on the N64 . Then , there is the satisfaction on unlocking the bonus content for you and your friends to enjoy later . This game shows how to give players an incentive to play through the game entirely and have something to show for it . Each track is huge and there are multiple surprises and shortcuts that each lap promises you a different experience each time . The different versions of Beetles are pretty damn cool and its worth unlocking all of them . The Beetle Battle mode is fun to play with your friends and is a game within itself ( the tracks are huge so getting 3 more players is the best way to go . ) This game will take you awhile to beat since it 's quite challenging and that leads into ... The CONS : ... right here . While BAR looks and sounds like an arcade racer , it uses real car physics so part of the challenge comes to getting used to how it feels and controls . The cars you start out with are slow and rigid while the ones you unlock later on control much better . Also , the A.I . cars start off slow and do n't pose a challenge but as you play through each difficulty level , they go faster , bump into you and rarely make a mistake so do n't be surprised if you have to try again to finish in 1st place . This game is for those who want to put in time to unlock all the goodies here so if you want to pick up and play right away , you wo n't have access to the entire game from the get go.Beetle Adventure Racing is a great racer that while can be quite difficult at times , can be fun and is a good choice for those who like the San Francisco Rush and Cruis'n games . It 's worth your money so those of you who like racing games and looking for a game to play with others , grab yourself a copy .	1
This is a good game to play when you figure out how to play it . I am still trying to figure out how to do some of the stunts on the game .	1
This is a racing game for anyone , and it features only the new version of the best selling car of all time , the Volkswagen Beetle . It is a great game , with different difficulty levels in the championships , challenging opponents , and progressively harder courses . This is also a great game for multiplayer , with the very original and fun & quot ; beetle battle & quot ; Courses : Coventry Cove : A simple course for beginners , not very hard , and many interesting shortcutsMount Mayhem : Significantly harder than Coventry Cove , this course takes you on a trip through a decked-out mountain , with many surprises and shortcuts and even a ski jump that you can take your car off of.Inferno Isle : Self Explanitory . It 's a course taking place on an island that is competing with a volcano , and there is also a spot where you can dive into the volcano ( not into the lava , of course , but into the volcano for that matter ) Sunset Sands : Egyptian themed course , running through ruins . Unlike the other courses , this one has shortcuts that make a very significant difference in your position.Metro Madness : also Self-Explanitory . A drive through the city streets at top speed , and an interesting shortcut that literally lets you drive through a hotel.Wicked Woods : A & quot ; scary & quot ; drive through a Sleepy Hollow style setting . Rightfully , the hardest course in the game.Altogether , I think that this is a game for anyone into the Volkswagen Beetle , racing games , or multiplayer . It combines the best interests of all elements of the racing game .	1
THERE ARE SIX LONG TRACKS TO RACE ON . I 'VE ONLY SEEN FOUR.. COVENTRY COVE , MOUNT MAYHEM , INFERNO ISLE & amp ; SUNSET SANDS . THE TRACKS I HAVE YET TO PLAY ARE.. METRO MADNESS & amp ; WICKED WOODS . MY FRIENDS AND I LOVE THIS RACING GAME . IT IS WELL MADE , NICE LOOKING & amp ; EASY TO CONTROL . YOU MUST BEAT THE INDIVIDUAL TRACKS ON CHAMPIONSHIP MODE FOR THEM TO APPEAR ON SINGLE RACE & amp ; TWO PLAYER MODES . I LOVE THE BOOST BOXES , THE SHORT CUTS , THE CAMERA OPTIONS & amp ; BEETLE BATTLE MODE . IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A QUAILITY RACING GAME AT A NOW AFFORDABLE PRICE.. & quot ; BEETLE ADVENTURE RACING & quot ; FOR YOUR N64 IS AN EXCELLENT CHOICE .	1
Beetle Adventure Racing is a fun racing game for all ages . The graphics are amazing for a Nintendo 64 . The Championship mode is a little to easy though . But I really love the Beetle Battle mode , especially with four players . It deserves 5 stars by far . It is a game well worth the money . It will keep you entertained for hours played levels , earning cars , and much more .	1
If you do n't have a Dreamcast and you love Capcom 's Vs. games , Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter for Playstation is a decent alternative . There are some notable flaws , as the Playstation hardware is just not made to run these type of games . For instance , the biggest let down is the abscence of tag-teaming ( the Playstation does not have enough RAM to store more than 2 characters within one loading session ) . Then there 's the animation ... there are definetly more than a few frames missing , but once you get used to it it 's OK . However , there a few gameplay extras Capcom included to keep players interested : a & quot ; helper & quot ; character for each match , a healing vitality gauge , and a combo system that allows you to chain hyper combos together . Best of all though , the gameplay stays relatively fast with minimal slowdown ( with the exception of extreme activity ) . This is another very noticeable improvement over the Playstation ports of Marvel Super Heroes and X-Men Vs. Street Fighter . If nothing else , Capcom is to be commended for putting up with the Playstation 's limitations to squeeze out the best possible port of this game .	1
why is it capcom never makes the hulk green he is always the wrong color on capcom games . thegame is fun animation good just the hulk 's color is wrong they either turn him pink or grey . good tagteam work , i like the turbo and wolverine looks like the comicbook style not some asian styled version of wolverine . works well on the vibration sound is distorted but otherwise a fun game .	1
This one makes the Street Fighter games on Super NES look so lame . It has lots of combos the appointeds move very fast . You can always tag team your partner during the game . When you do your signature move the back ground looks has flashing lights , speaking of background I have to say what amazing 2D graphics . Even though this game says Marvel vs Street Fighter does n't mean only the super heros fight the Street fighters you can make Spider man fight one of the X-Men . I guset they got the idea to make this game is cause the japanese are have great animes these and the U.S. challenges them .	1
I 've been a big fan of the Street Fighter series since its outset . And to be quite honest , playing Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter only reminds me of how great the series used to be . Sure , the game is mildly entertaining , but without the true tag team gameplay that the arcade version of the game had , it comes off as just another Street Fighter game with Marvel characters . The character roster totals out at 17 , with nine from the Street Fighter universe and eight from Marvel . There are five modes of play including battle , versus , training , hero battle , and crossover . Battle and versus are your typical one- and two-player fighting game modes . Hero Battle is an endurance mode that separates the groups to see which has the stronger stable of fighters . Nothing special here . Crossover mode , however , is at least somewhat interesting . You see , in the original version of MSH vs. SF you could pick two fighters whom you could switch between at any time during the fight . This tag team style of fighting was first featured in the arcade version of X-Men vs. Street Fighter but could n't make it into the PlayStation port due to the technical limitations of the PlayStation . Sadly , the tag team aspect of MSH vs. SF was also excluded for the same reason . Sure , you can still pick two characters , but you can only play as one of them . The second character only comes into play when you execute a team combo or team counter . Crossover mode tries to bring the game 's main selling point home . This mode allows you to pick two characters , then the computer uses the same characters you picked . This limits the amount of information the PlayStation has to handle to two characters instead of four . If you are victorious in this battle , the computer swaps one of the characters each of you have for another . This is done so that you are n't playing with and against the same two characters each fight . It gives you the tag team experience of the arcade , but having to deal with the rotating character thing and having to fight mirror images of yourself is extremely weak . Visually , MSH vs. SF looks good . But when you compare it with its arcade counterpart , it simply fails . The colors are n't nearly as vibrant , and the game suffers from quite a bit of slowdown . It still comes across better than the PlayStation version of X-Men vs. Street Fighter , though , because not nearly as much animation was cut out . This is a major plus , since frames of animation not only affect the game 's appearance but timing and gameplay as well.On the gameplay side , Street Fighter fans will definitely feel the typical Street Fighter gameplay . But in the end , it 's all a question of how starved you are for another Street Fighter game . Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter is all about the tag team mode , and with the overall exclusion of this mode , Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter is just another Street Fighter game .	1
This is probably one of the most exciting and intense racing games I have ever played . Set in the Star Wars universe , this is definitely one that 's sure to last a long , long time.It 's a surprisingly long game , although it did n't take too long to beat . It also has great replay value , and I enjoy it now just as much as I did when I first purchased it . Throughout the game , and as you advance through the various courses , you will be able to implement the money you earn to purchase better parts for your particular pod racer . As you advance , you 'll also be able to select more powerful ( and occasionally weaker ) pods to test out . Run through each of them , and see which fits you best . It might be the difference between coming out on top , or being involved in the biggest explosion since the Death Star ! There 's also an amazing score of wonderful John Williams music from Episode I . There are various tracks for each course , and they add an even better thrill to the game . The graphics are also very good , much better than on the N64 . If you have a good computer , and a decent 3D card , you should have no problems . I have a 300Mhz system with a Voodoo2 , and it rocked ! All in all , LucasArts has done it again ! May the force be with you ! ( Believe me , you 'll need it ! )	1
I bought it ( when it first came out ) for full price ... and thought I might have wasted my money ... let me tell ya ... NO WAY..I did n't waste ONE penny ... It 's like racing indy cars but much faster , they turn easier and they fly ... : ) ... There are 4 levels to this game . Level one has 7 races , all aare pretty easy . After you finish the level , you are given access to one level in level 4 ... each level is the same , but each getting harder ... there are 4 races in level four , and let me tell ya ... THEY ARE HARD ! ! ! ! ! ! ! : ) ... ! ! ! : ) ... ( I still hav n't completed races 3 and 4 in level 4 ! ! ! ) ... The Graphics are TOP NOTCH ! ! The compant , Lucasarts produces the best graphics in computer games . The game follows the story line of the movie well . Sure , the tracks are on differant planets than just Tatooine , but hey ; It 's fun ! : ) I love the game . And the characters from the movie , you can play all of them . The ONE thing that is not like the movie ( BUT I 'M GLAD IT IS ON THE GAME ) is the & quot ; YOU GET A NEW PODRACER & quot ; feature when you crash ... It 's a life saver ! ! ! ALL AROUND , I GIVE THIS GAME A 2 , maybe 3 , thumbs up.JASON ANDERSON	1
THIS GAME IS JUST AWSOME.AND GIVE JAKE A BREAK HE WAS A LITTLE KID AT THE TIME.LIKE TO SEE U GUYS DO A BETTER JOB	1
If you think that the & quot ; Star Wars Episode 1 : Racer & quot ; is an effort to cash in on the _Phantom Menace_ hype , you vastly underestimate the talent at Lucasarts . As usual , they top expectations and deliver something far beyond a merchandising tie-in . This is a product which pushes the boundaries of the racing genre . Take this feature-rich game out of the Star Wars Universe and you still have a thrilling , easily-networkable ride.The large number of different racers with different qualties is somewhat _pro forma_ nowadays in the genre , but Lucasarts takes the idea one step further . By winning purses , you earn money with which to upgrade your racer . Thus there are a number of useful configurations which are only possible through victory.The number and quality of camera angles is equally impressive . In fact , the cockpit view is downright revolutionary . From this vantage point , you feel the 400-mph+ speeds , and it 's comparatively harder in this camera to complete tricky courses.Where the game flags , I suppose , is in its surprising unfaithfulness to the film . There 's no ability to eliminate opposition by & quot ; dirty tricks & quot ; , and you ca n't disable the & quot ; i-crashed-but-now-i-have-a-new-racer & quot ; feature . The pod racers are absolutely indestructible here ( though they can be seriously damaged ) and that 's a disappointment . I would 've liked a & quot ; harder-edged & quot ; version -- perhaps one you could toggle on and off -- but it 's a small complaint for an otherwise stunning effort .	1
I 'm not going to bother explaining what Tetris is , as by now , all of you have been laying bricks for the past two decades.Instead , I will explain why this just might be the best tetris since the original.Except for missing the catchy original Tetris music , this versian improves vastly over the original.Giving the game a nice color overhaul made it really pretty to look at , and they beefed it up with several features I wished were in the original ( without ruining it like they did in Tetris Worlds for the gba ) For example , there is a save anywhere feature , so you can play it anytime you want . Also , how many of us wish that you could play Tetris against another ? Well , in the origianl , you had to have a buddy who had a link cabe , a gameboy and a copy of tetris to play . You still have to do that in this versian , but you can also challenge the computer to matches , and it will send you garabge blocks just like it would if you were playing one of your friends . You can set the difficulty three levels , and the higher you set it , the more aggressive the computer becomes.Also , my main complaint with Tetris Worlds was there was no scoring feature , but this versian has plenty , and even saves the when you turn off the game . Not even the original did that ! ( At least , not in my gb game ) There is the `` view next piece '' feature , but you can turn it off if you wish , but there is no '' infinate rotate '' feature , or `` ghost/shadow piece '' to let you see when to drop it.I was very disappointed with the gba Tetris Worlds , and it 's funny that I should tell people to go buy this instead of the gba game , but this one is worth the purchase , folks ! Get this , and forget there ever was a `` Tetris Worlds '' , as this one improves over the original in almost all ways ( exept the music..I would have liked the russian tetris music , instead we get this weird techno-pop music . )	1
This is the best puzzle game ever made . Although I love the Puyo Puyo style games ( Dr. Mario , Columns , Bust A Move , etc . ) , I have to say that Tetris is the cream of the crop . After all , Tetris is what sold the original Gameboy , and it was logical to make Tetris DX a launch title when the Game Boy Color came out . I bought the GBC the day it was released , and I bought Tetris DX the next week , and Tetris DX is one of the most-played titles on my GBC ... the sheer addictiveness of the game is so frickin ' awesome , and I love how blocks fall faster in later levels ( so it has an 1980 's old-school style to it ... I love & quot ; old school & quot ; games ) .	1
I have both this game AND Tetris Worlds for Game Boy Advance , And I love them both as much as the other . Tetris worlds my not have a Battery Back-up , but it more than makes up for that with the extremely fun game variations and the classic tetris Music.Tetris DX DOES Have a battery , but it 's just basic tetris . I 'm able to score at least 400,000 points regularly , so every time I top out I have to put up with that annoying rocket launch sequence , wheras with Tetris Worlds , when you top out , you can start the next game right away without having to put up with annoying rocket sequences . the bottom line : went I want to play Classic Tetris , I play Tetris DX . when I want Enhanced graphics and effects and Nostalgic Music , I play Tetris Worlds	1
When the original Game Boy launched in 1989 , Tetris was the pack in cartridge that introduced the world to one of the most recognized games ever . Almost ten years later , right after the release of the Game Boy Color , Nintendo releases a colorful port of an addictive puzzle game we came to know and love . Tetris DX is the original Game Boy Tetris now in color and adds two more game modes and 2 player VS support . It was still great to play as it is now.Everyone knows what Tetris is so I wo n't explain it as many other reviewers have done so already . Tetris DX gets the full color support and has three game modes : Marathon ( keep playing until it 's game over ) , Ultra ( score as many points as you can in 3 minutes ) and 40 Lines ( clear 40 lines as fast as you can . ) You can connect another Game Boy Color from another player and play against him/her and even send your high scores over to his/her copy of the game.It 's a great game overall with lots of re playability . If you had friends , then it was twice as fun to play against the other person and see who gets the highest score . Though nowadays , there are better versions of Tetris on the market , this will always remain a classic . It was a treat for Game Boy Color owners and was one game everyone got into .	1
You will love Tetris DX ! I had the Tetris Gold Collection from Spectrum Holobyte CD for Windows , and I did n't think I would like this one , but it hooked me ! You can change the music , pause the game and it keeps 3 of your highest scores . Very addictive and enjoyable !	1
Tetris DX is a very fun game ! You will be addicted to it in no time ! There are many different things you can do to change the game settings . For example , you can change the music . You can also change the level you are on yourself , although I would n't recommend doing it until after you have become a very good player . There also many game modes you can play in , like 40 Lines , on which you have to get 40 lines without your blocks hitting the top , Marathon , on which you just keep going and going and going until your blocks hit the top , or Ultra , where you see how good you can do , except you only have 3 minutes to do so . The computer also keeps track of your best records and displays them when you are choosing your level . Tetris DX is an absolutely terrific game ! I would recommend it to anybody ! You 'll have a lot of fun playing it . Thank you for reading my review . I hope it helped .	1
TETRIS is a videogame that needs no introduction . You probably know how to play it , and if you do n't , I 'm sure there 's some sort of free online download that 'll get you started.What makes TETRIS DX my personal favorite of all the iterations is that it gets the extra details just right . The music is solid , and while I prefer the NES version 's tracks , this version 's music is pretty good.The colors are beautiful . The game changes backgrounds as you advance in the game . I strongly recommend a Game Boy Advance SP , because seeing this game nowadays is trickier than it used to be . ( That bloody DS has spoiled us ! ) The sound effects on the gaming board never grow old . That might not seem important , but since you 're gon na be rotating pieces and forming lines and Tetris-es non-stop , you 'll be grateful.The post-game rocket launches ( there are about 7 , the higher score the more elaborate the launch ) are nice additions . What 's pretty funny is that with the exception of the best spaceship launch , all the others fail for silly reasons . The weakest one gets distracted by a bird , and just flies off the left side of the screen ! There are 3 save game slots , and a Guest file . So , all your hard work will never be erased . I think even a Guest 's high scores will be saved , as long as it topples the saved files . But in any event , this is a very user-friendly game.There are 4 modes of gameplay . `` Classic '' is your traditional game of TETRIS . `` Ultra '' is the same as `` Classic '' , but the gaming board is shorter . `` 40 Lines '' is just trying to clear 40 lines as fast as possible , with some obstacle pieces thrown in . Aside from the regular `` Classic '' mode , `` VS.COM '' is my favorite , because when facing an offscreen opponent on Hard difficulty , you better bring your A-game . `` Classic '' and `` VS '' are endlessly fun , while the other two features are decent additions.Unfortunately , you will need some old-school Game Boy link cables to play with 2 human people . If competition against live opponents is what you crave , then getting TETRIS DS or the console versions is the way to go.But if you 're a solo player , I believe TETRIS DX is the absolute best . The game just has a smooth flow to it . I loved the DS version , but hated that the Classic mode stopped after 200 lines . Because of the DS version 's other unique features , that 's also well worth your time and money.It 's also worth mentioning that even though this game is advertised as a Game Boy Color , it 'll play just fine the old-school Game Boy . I 'm not sure about the Game Boy Advance units , though.TETRIS DX is easily the best choice if you 're looking for old-school TETRIS with the best available presentation `` AND '' limitless single-player gaming . Grab a Game Boy , and have some fun . It wo n't cost much .	1
Wow ... the only Game Boy games that even come close to this are probably Mario Golf and Super Mario Bros. DX . The game starts off when you wake up in a bed on Koholint Island , and you must recover your sword and shield . Once you go down to the shore and pick up your sword , an owl tells you that you must wake the Wind Fish , but in order to do that , you need the eight Instruments of the Sirens from the eight levels ( Tail Cave , Bottle Grotto , Key Cavern , Angler 's Tunnel , Catfish 's Maw , Face Shrine , Eagle 's Tower , Turtle Rock ) . In these levels , you pick up a good variety of items . You get the Roc 's Feather for jumping , The Power Braclet for picking up rocks , the Pegasus Boots for running really fast , the Flippers for swimming , the Hookshot for clearing long gaps , a more powerful Power Bracelet , a Mirror Shield for reflecting beams , and the Magic Rod for melting ice ! But some of these levels have keys , and to get the Slime Key ( Level 3 ) and the Angler Key , you will be running crazy , all across the island . Along with that are other side missions . There is a trading game through the entire game which will lead you getting the Magnifying Lens , and with which you can see a man on the shore , who will trade you whatever is in your B button ( Use the shovel ) for a fine Boomerang . There are also a good deal of Secret Seashells , and if you get 20 , you can get the Level 2 Sword , which can shoot beams at full power ! You also get a couple friends along the way . For getting into the second level , you get to walk Bowwow , the big Chain Chomp that lives next to Marin and Tarin . He will eat the poisonous plants in front of the entrance . You can also revive the Flying Rooster , a rooster that you pick up for full flight , so you can get the Bird Key . But never forget the main mission : Wake the Wind Fish . For he is not the only one inside the egg ...	1
The first game of the Zelda series that is made for Gameboy Color , The Legend of Zelda : Links Awakening DX is one of the most memberable Zelda games . This time , Link does n't have to save the world , but rather himself ! While Link is sailing on the ocean , his boat is struck by a lightning bolt , causing his ship to wreck.Tossed about in the water , he lands on an island . But since he has landed on the island , all he can think of is getting off of it ! But the only way he can is to awake the Wind Fish by obtaining all the instruments of the Sirens . This game has an excellent game play , and story-line ! It is worth every penny !	1
The Legend of Zelda : Link 's Awakening is quite the impressive game.It basically takes the gameplay of A Link to the Past and combines it with the original NES Legend of Zelda ( graphic-wise especially ) and creates a fun adventure . You can charge your sword , run with the boots , pick up bushes and do several other things the same way as you did in A Link to the Past.Now , truth be told , A Link to the Past is easily the superior game in comparison because that game does EVERYTHING right.Link 's Awakening is basically a watered down version of the same thing with a choppier framerate , less than spectacular graphics , significantly worse music , and even the size of the land is much , much smaller as well . Expect less from an exploration standpoint.However , for anyone craving A Link to the Past 's style of gameplay , this is a great continuation of that legendary game . I 'm not concerned about the timeline of the series- I just know Link 's Awakening came out a couple years after A Link to the Past . Considering this is a Game Boy game however , and that we have to be understanding of a few shortcomings and limitations thanks to the technology at the time , this game is awesome.You have many of the same enemies making a return , along with many of the familiar items that has made the Zelda series such a spectacular source of entertainment . Some of the boss fights in Link 's Awakening are fairly clever , and it seems to be a trend for Nintendo ( or at least , it used to be ) for the boss fights to be downright strange in their Game Boy incarnations compared to their NES and Super NES versions.My only complaint ( and the reason I 'm not giving Link 's Awakening 5 stars ) is because the dungeons have their share of boring moments from time to time , especially when it comes to key searching which can be sort of frustrating and uninteresting . Plus the dungeons appear sort of bland and uninspiring more often than not . This is a small complaint , believe me.Also , another tiny complaint ( that *doesn't* affect the 4-star rating I 'm giving the game ) is all the Mario references . You have goombas , bomb ombs , chain chomps , bloopers , cheep cheeps , thwomps ... even those cactuses from Super Mario Bros. 2 This is total overkill . If that 's not enough , this next part will blow your mind . Wart from Super Mario Bros. 2 , Bowser , Yoshi and even Princess Toadstool make appearances in the game ! To me , I HATE when two very different games combine the enemies and pretend it 's perfectly normal . It 's not . I like to pretend the Zelda and Mario worlds are two separate places that should NEVER blend together . *Just* because Nintendo created both of these franchises does n't mean I like this idea.Also , some of the enemies are sort of lame . You have pink bird creatures that smile , and all the characters seem to have enormous heads . It looks silly . The characters in A Link to the Past are more sensible and presentable.One thing I LOVE is the ability to leap over empty pits , which is probably the most underrated and useful item in the game . Oh , and I LOVE the special triangle item that certain defeated enemies leave behind that increases the strength of your sword for a temporary period of time . It 's awesome ! The game overall is pretty high on the challenge scale . This is mainly due to the fact you have to be careful how you manage your hearts- you 're not given enough of them compared to A Link to the Past . Some of the enemies such as those shielded creatues from Castle 5 can take forever to locate their weak point , and do n't even MENTION the huge pain in the rear end that is the worm fight that first appeared in Castle 3 of A Link to the Past . You thought he was annoying in that game , huh ? He 's back and more annoying than ever here ! Overall , pick up A Link to the Past first , then the original Legend of Zelda for the NES , then Link 's Awakening .	1
Link 's Awakening is probably the best Gameboy version of Zelda ever . Although , that is left to ones ' opinion ... .It is in my opinion , however , to be.The game begins with Link waking up in a hut . He is told by the locals that to leave and go back to Hyrule , he must awaken the Wind Fish . It lives inside an egg on top of a nearby mountain and can only be lulled from its ' sleep by playing eight magical instruments . You spend your time trying to round up these eight instrumants but , in order to do so , you have to endure varying types of puzzles , traps and enemies . Each puzzle you 're faced with has a logical solution , and you 'll only come across a few situations that will require you to leave and get new items from the outside . Koholint Island , is big ( by Gameboy standards anyhow ) - even more so when you consider the hidden underground passageways , dungeons , and waterways so you 'll have plenty of exploring to do with alot of secrets to uncover . You 'll definitely spend countless hours playing this game.Gameboy Color/Gameboy Advance owners are granted access to an all-new exclusive dungeon ( although it is n't required or necessary to complete the game ) plus those with a Gameboy printer get a photo scrapbook of Link 's adventures that you can copy ... hence the DX ( deluxe ) added at the end of the title of this version.This is one classic that should n't be missed . If you 've played any of the other Legend of Zelda games , you owe it to yourself to check it out . You do n't know what you 're missing .	1
I have to say that although this game does not include Gannon or Zelda ... It is one of my favorite Zelda games . I love the story line , I feel like you get to know the characters much better . It 's like playing a book which is how Zelda games , the good ones , tend to feel to me . It carries a message too ... .I do n't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares . Of the game boy Zelda games , I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap . Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in . It 's not too hard but it is a fair challenge ( nothing like the originals ) and it could be confusing if you do n't know anything about Zelda but ... .for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice .	1
This game is the best game I 've ever played for GB . I have the original version , not DX . ( If you do n't know the difference , DX is in color , but the original is in shades of grey . ( I guess there are a couple additions in the DX game . But I repeat , ONLY a COUPLE . ) ) But , it 's still pretty much the same concept . There are plenty of puzzles to keep you thinking , and tons of items . The bosses are pretty hard , and they 're a puzzle themselves ; you need to find out what method and item you need to use against them . Graphics are good ( remember I 'm playing the original ) ; they are not exceptional , but good enough that you can clearly see what things are , and there is a lot of detail . The sound is good also ; you do n't get bogged down in too many sounds at once , but you can hear everything that goes on . If you like action games , this is good for you ; but you 're going to have to think , so stay away if you do n't like puzzles . PUZZLES ! Wow , there sure are a lot of them . Some of them are extremely difficult , and just when you think you 're going to give up , or cheat off of a walkthrough , you figure it out ! Hence , it 's not impossible , just difficult . Well , RPG players , have a nice feast !	1
I still occasionally start a new game on this game just because I like playing it over and over again . I still can not believe how much they put into a simple game boy cartridge . I mean this game is HUGE . There are 8 dungeons , a long & quot ; trading & quot ; sidequest , lots of heart pieces to collect , 20+ sea shells ( you only need 20 for the & quot ; special & quot ; prize , I 'll leave that up to you ) , and lots of mini-quests you must complete before you even enter some dungeons . The story is simple but gets the point across and the graphics are optimized with the Game Boy Color . If you have n't played this game , you 're missing out , especially if you 're a fan of the Zelda games and/or the game boy . Trust me on this one . I still remember when I first got the black/white version 5 or so years ago and it took me an hour to figure out you could use your shield on the spikey guys , lol . The game 's bosses can actually be challenging sometimes which is something I see less and less of nowadays . Once again , buy this game .	1
oh my goodness this is a speciality of y son that he likes immensely , very enjoyable and you can get involved in the story by watching	1
From the very first game on the old Nintendo , I have always enjoyed the Zelda games . I was very excited to find out when they released this first gameboy version so I could take the games with me . There are other Zelda gameboy/GBA games since which I have yet to play , but I do reccomend this one for your library.The level of play is very in depth , way more than the original Zelda 's but about half the size of the Super NES Zelda game . The game play and style is also more similar to the Super NES version.Its a basic tale as Link is trapped on an island of mystery . You collect items and beat different mini-monsters trying to solve the riddles . There is also an owl you can call for help if you ever get confused on your adventure . There is also an onboard detailed map so there is no additional manuals or guides needed to lug around to play this game.There actually was a bug in the system which frustrated me and stopped me from playing this game for a while . It involved a warp flute in a later level and I accidently warped onto a statue causing Link to be stuck in some pixel overlap mishap . Otherwise , I really enjoyed this game , and as long as you are careful with that whistle ... you will too !	1
Ever since I played Ocarina of Time ( the best game ever That has won many top ten lists ) I have been a devoted zelda fan . I set of to play them all . So even though this is considered an old rusty title I was set on playing it . Now of the Zelda titles this is one of the better ones . This game contains quality , and very few modern games are this good.If you are curious This is my third favorite game just behind Ocarina of Time and A Link to the past . If you want a good title skip those DS games and get a copy of this.This game is old so the music and graphics are n't top notch but i still enjoyed them . It has an amazing soundtrack ! I never got tired of the over world theme , and the rest is memorial too . The graphics are n't anything special but any well colored game is fine by me.The fighting/dungeons were ok . They had challenge but actually I did n't find them amazing . The over world was a real treat . It was well made and fun to explore . This is were the real quality comes in.I have seen better characters and storys , but you ca n't help thinking fondly of this game 's story/character . It left a mark and I will always remember them/it . It is hard to explain.I can see wy this has been a favorite for many gamers for over a century . It was well make , well liked and if you have n't already play it . ! max stars ! ( more than five )	1
If you get into this game , it will provide you with many many hours of fun and challenges . However , as with many roleplaying games , if you get to a part where you 're stuck , you may be tempted to just quit . However , there 's so much good stuff in this game that I hope you wo n't - go find one of the FAQs or walkthroughs on the web to help you out.If you 're familiar with the Pokemon game , this is similar , but you have to fight any bad guys ( instead of relying on your Pokemon to do it ) ! This requires a bit of dexterity ( something you did n't really need for Pokemon ) , and also some fast thinking.There are a variety of puzzles in the games , including boss monsters with specific weaknesses , areas to get through that require some fancy footwork , rock-pushing puzzles , and the usual role-playing game puzzles of figuring out what to do with some of the items you find.It 's easy in spots , but challenging enough at many points to really keep your interest.The color enhancements to the original game are nice , and the music is varied and pleasant.A couple of hints for you - after you get the boots , try charging at the walls in the library . Also , if you get the bow , and equip with the bow and with bombs , you can shoot a & quot ; bomb arrow & quot ; by pressing both buttons at once . It 'll be like a normal arrow , but it will explode on impact .	1
This game is totally awesome . Very advanced , wide variety of items , enemies , and places . Excellent graphics , even for Gameboy . A very challenging adventure is in this cartridge , and its tons of fun ! Play it on a Gameboy Color and you can go to a secret dungeon ! Its like a normal labryinth , and instead of getting an instrument , you get red clothes which doubles your offense permanently , or blue clothes , which doubles your defense permanently ( my personal choice ) . Superb game ! Excellent adventure .	1
The following is in reference to the downloadable version of Zelda : Link 's Awakening DX available on Nintendo eShop for the 3DS/2DS system.A colorized remake of the original Game Boy game , Link 's Awakening marks the beginning of our hero 's adventures in the world beyond Hyrule , leaving him stranded on an island filled with mystery and danger . Playing this shortly after beating Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages ( and finishing in half the time ) , I 'm tempted to rename it `` Oracle of Dreams . '' Released before the Oracle games , LA uses the exact same game engine ; same graphics , same sound , same mechanics . This basically laid out the groundwork for every Zelda title in Game Boy Color 's lifespan . Once I was fully equipped for the task , I only had the most trouble with the seventh dungeon , while I defeated most of the bosses -- including the last one -- on my first try . Add to that the exclusive Color Dungeon , which rewards the player with a red or blue tunic that boosts his/her offense and defense respectively , and beating LA is a tropical breeze.That 's not to say I did n't get my kicks , though . There was still the whole item trading sequence to keep the player busy . And speaking of items , the equipment acquired through your quest includes swag I wish could 've made it to later games like the Hookshot , the Bow and Arrow and a magic rod to light those hard-to-reach torches . LA also makes a bunch of fun references to other Nintendo mascots , and you even get to walk a flower-eating Chain Chomp . You 're also followed by a talking mouse ( not THAT talking mouse ) who shoots photos that can be printed with the Game Boy Printer ( when hooked up to a compatible system ) . That should come as no surprise when you consider how technologically advanced the island 's inhabitants are , already having built numerous telephone booths where you can call a GamePro-type hotline.On a final note , a common problem among those who played LA is the save feature , which was fixed in later titles . To clarify , you can save by pressing all the face buttons ( minus the D-Pad ) at once , but only if you want to quit the game . All in all , Link 's Awakening is an entertaining little diversion worth checking out at least once.The product is rated E for Everyone , containing mild violence .	1
With The Minish Cap coming out soon , and looking to be another disappointment ( I will reserve final judgment until I actually play it , but it has a definite Wind Waker vibe ) , the handheld gamer would do well to revisit this classic . The gameplay is incredible and compelling and the story is perhaps the best in the series ; the only two faults with this game are minor for any true gamer . The graphics are n't very good ; the sprites are simply poorer-quality A Link to the Past sprites oftentimes , but the game is so good one will hardly notice . The sound effects are pretty poor , but , thankfully , there 's always the music to compensate for that ... and what good music.It feels like ALttP , looks like it , plays like it , and is second only to that excellent SNES game .	1
i never actually played the game , just bought to add to what i already owned.. im sure its pretty cool	1
This RPG ( Role-Playing Game ) is pretty easy to play and lasts a long time . To play , you simply asign a weapon , such as a sword or the hook shot , to A or B . The battle sequences are very good for a 2-D system and allow fun battles . It 's often hard to find out what to do , but usually is n't frustratingly difficult . Many secrets are available which , while unnecessary , make it easier and make it last longer . I recommend this game for all people .	1
Before Game Boy Advance , there was Game Boy . On Game Boy , there was Link 's Awakening . The Legend of Zelda : Link 's Awakening was the best game for Game Boy at the time , and still remains much more than a simple piece of nostalgia . Will Link 's Awakening 's graphics turn you off ? They are still crisp today , and the color version should alleviate some of the dated aspects of LA 's graphics , but do n't expect 32-bit goodness that we might see in a GBA Zelda game . The sound is traditional Zelda fare with some now-classic tunes ; this was the game that introduced the now popular & quot ; instrument & quot ; item that does neat stuff for you.Make no mistake about it - Link 's Awakening is a great game , a force to be reckoned with , and a savior for kids on long car trips . The puzzles in this game were particularly good , the storyline was new and refreshing , and the game was really fun . Replay value is high even though you will face the same dungeon challenges , but one time through this game might be enough since its length is decent even by today 's standards . If you do n't own a GBA , definitely buy this game . If you own a GBA.. definitely buy this game anyway . Play it and love it.This review refers to the DX version that was released on Game Boy Color , but it is not worth owning independently of the original game boy version . Certainly , if buying this game today , get the DX version . If you just really love Link 's Awakening , do n't overkill it - owning both is just silly .	1
The graphics are piss-poor but the game play and music rarely get better.Bulbasaur is better than any other starter ever and always will be . Charmander was cute but not as cool . And Squirtle as adorable as he was was way too slow.The madness never stopped in my house once me and my bro ( 22 and 16 now ) got these into our grubby paws . We did next to no trading , but tons of gaming.20 Pokemon that are in this title are : Bulbasaur , Starmie , Vulpix , Vileplume , Articuno , Electabuzz , Ponyta , Gloom , Tangela , Lickitung , Mewtwo , Chansey , Taurus , Jynx , Oddish , Golbat , Horsea , Dragonite and Magmar.Game play : A-Sound : B-Originality : A-Story : C-Trading : A-Fun : AReplay : A++Overall : B4 stars .	1
I understand that this is an original , but there are some things I did n't quite like with this game . In the Unknown Dungeon , I climbed a set of stairs and then ended up in a wall ! I could n't move anywhere except for out of it and back to the previous level . Eventually I managed to get up without being forced into the wall . Also , most of the game is Blue if played on the Game Boy Color or Advance systems . Gameplay , music , and the story are all extraordinarily great for a Game Boy title .	1
Besides this again being a re-purchased item and a older game ; it was fun to play again despite horrible older graphics .	1
Overall good purchase . The only issue I had was that the battery had died so I had to send it back but it came back in due time .	1
If you overlook this game because you think it is & quot ; kiddie & quot ; then you are missing out on a great RPG adventure . Go ahead , bite the bullet and play .	1
Awesome classic . Nintendo made one great game here , I hope kids these days will still play the oldies .	1
We probably all know about the hype that Pokemon ( Pocket Monsters ) has received about 7 years ago . It started off as a game that originated in Japan around 1995-1996 , and it was introduced to the United States in 1998 . A TV show and a trading card series followed . Plush Pikachu dolls were everywhere . I was a big fan of this fad , and I was only in the 5th grade ( late 1999 ) when I purchased this game and strapped in for the time of my life.This is the `` blue version '' of the original Game Boy series . Just like in the Red Version , there are Pokemon that can not be captured ( Ekans , Magmar , Scyther , Growlith and Mankey just to name a few ) , and a trade cable will be required to fulfill `` catching them all '' , but here 's a little lowdown and some advice to some starters of this game : You are given one out of three Pokemon to start out with ( Bulbasaur , Charmander , Squirtle ) , and note that your first trainer is Brock , who uses the rock type . I recommend you choose Squirtle if you want to take it easy at first , because it learns Bubble at level 8 . Bulbasaur is also a good choice , but it does n't learn Vine Whip until level 13 . ( I 'm explaining the best moves to defeat Brock 's Pokemon . ) Charmander is not a good bet , but good for a challenge . When you get to Pewter City , however , do n't rush to battle Brock until you feel like you are prepared . Metapod and Kakuna give out a lot of experience points so that leveling is easier , and if you catch a Caterpie/Metapod and raise it to a level 12 Butterfree , it can also help defeat Brock as well ( with its Confusion skill ) .If you 're familiar with the later games of this series , you 'll realize a lot of differences . You can hold only 20 different types of items at a time ( including PokeBalls and Key Items ) . And you got ta love the cheesy Pokemon graphics ! Despite some flaws that have n't been perfected until the later games of the series , this is still a classic game.And I 'm not a big fan of RPG style games , but this is the easiest and less stressful of them in my opinion . Recommended .	1
Thanks again for this I have been a pokemon fanatic ever since I was a kid . I could n't ask for more thanks again .	1
Let us be honest with ourselves . This is an old game . And yet it rocks most hard , say thankee . It 's also highly addictive.The point of Pokemon is simple : catch cute , little , animated talking monsters with magic , plastic balls , and use them to kick the living daylights out of the cute talking monsters of your enemies . So in truth , it 's a lot like real life.Plus , said monsters are fully changeable . You can give them a name , teach them special fighting skills , and even control how much they grow . This makes them much better than hamsters as pets go.Plus , its got ninjas ! I 'm not only talking about a ninja master who uses Pokemon to duel you ( I guess he never learned how to use shuriken or swords or stuff ) , I also mean you can name you Pokemon things like : Mifune or Hayabusa or Zatoichi or Swordsman with an Umbrella ( that probably wo n't fit ) . Of course , you can also name it Winky-dinky-do , if it do please ya . But I digress.Yes , Pokemon shows its age among modern video games . But so does Pong . And Pong is still mildly amusing . But without Pong , there 'd be no Pokemom . And without Pokemon , there 'd be no modern video gamage . And without video games , I 'd have to actually face my family , friends and problems , and learn actual skills ! So play Pokemon ! It 's better than Pong , and many other video games . Trust me . I 've been there .	1
Purchased for my son . He used birthday money to buy an old gameboy color and wanted Pokemon for it . None of the local stores has a used game in stock with a good battery . This had a new battery installed and works great .	1
I Love This Game.There 's Tons Of Weird Creatures Called Pokemon To Catch And A Lot Of Things To Do As Well.The Really Nice Thing About Pokemon Blue Is The Fact That Blastoise Has Really Cool Moves.This Is A Game That Anyone Who Owns A Game Boy Should Own . Ya Got ta Get This Game It 's So Good .	1
Pokemon was immensely popular in the late 1990s to early 2000s , and still has quite a fan base here in the new decade . Pokemon Blue , along with Red , was a remarkable feat that blended fun , as well as underlying lessons for many kids . As daunting as the task is , Ash Ketchum must show that he is the Pokemon master and the better of the two , when face to face with Gary Oak , his nemesis . During your journey , you 'll encounter Gym masters , fun places to explore , new Pokemon , and much more . A truly fun and epic adventure.This game has many underlying lessons like : * Cities with different colors - many of which I did n't know existed - like lavender , saffron , and indigo . * Exploration - the idea of getting used to trying new things and ultimately carefully looking everywhere to find what needs to be found* Pokemon names - the many pokemon names were cleverly named to highlight its characteristics , like Mime , Diglett , Bulbasaur , Starmie , ditto , Drowzee , etc . My vocabulary expanded and I learned so much . The Pokemon alone are so immensely helpful in making words make sense . * Perseverance - when you lose the battle , it 's simple : you just come back and try again until you achieve the mission or catch the Pokemon you want . It 's immediately built into the psyche of the gamer . The game makes Ash Ketchum such a relateable and likeable character.The subtle educational aspect of this game is astounding and I 'm very glad that I was one of the kids in my day playing Pokemon Blue .	1
The original and best Pokemon game in the series in my opinion . Collect all of the original Pokemon to become a master !	1
It has always been a habit for children to exhibit and swap their card/sticker/toy collections with their friends in school . The premise of Pokemon -to collect and train pokemon - was the perfect fertile growing field to exploit this fascination children had with collecting things . The first exploit was the TV show , where the characters in the videogame were rendered onto the TV screen . When that became popular enough , the creators rendered the full 150 Pokemon into thousands of different incarnations . Pokemon T-shirts , teddybears , actionfigures , trading cards , stickers , watches etc were all created under the slogan : 'you 've got ta catch 'em all ' ... Parents had a rotten time , that 's for sure . And it was this capitalistic , persistent , and continuous explotation of the pokemon name which made the name synonymous with childrens toys . The pokemon legacy was ruined by this exploitation , and the videgame was largely discredited as a childrens fad . But before the TV show , the toys , the trading cards , etc..the game stood pure and unspoilt by the impending pokemon-craze which was about to accompany it . Everybody loved the game . Pokemon was revered.In the game you play as Ash , whose one single ambition is to become the greatest Pokemon trainer in the world . To do so you must collect pokemon and train them in battle . To catch Pokemon you need to engage in combat with wild Pokemon ( wild animals ) . You choose which of your Pokemon is suitable for the fight and deminish the wild pokemon 's strengh little by little untill it becomes weak enough to be captured . Once caught , the wild pokemon will become loyal and obedient . There 's no 'set in stone ' rule when it comes to catching Pokemon , if you fancy the look of a Pokemon , then you capture it . Wild Pokemon are scattered throughout the game and you can catch them at any time.To complete the game , you must collect all eight gym badges . Gym badges are given to those who defeat gym owners . Gym owners are professional Pokemon trainers who are hardened by battle experience , and thus , much harder to defeat than normal Pokemon trainers . It takes a long time to collect the badges , because the gyms are sporodically spread throughout the game . Between collecting badges and training Pokemon , you will encounter many RPG elements in the game , puzzles , dungeons , items , etc ... The game is huge and difficult and can take over 25 hours to complete . It certainly exceeds the expectations of a game merely designed to kill time on a long coach trip , which was what the GB was created for in the first place . Taking into account that the GB is a very primitive console , the kind of experience Pokemon offers exceeds all prior benchmarks in handheld gaming . It 's an edifying experience.Not only is it the best GB game , it is one of the best overall games ever .	1
This type of RPG was easy to master , because at the start of the game , I chose Bulbasaur for this type of match . I used him in the first 2 stages of the game , but sometimes the rest of the game . Whenever you use a fire-type attack on an ice/water type , it will either say & quot ; It 's super effective & quot ; or & quot ; It 's not very effective & quot ; Otherwise , this game 's a blast to play , with 150 different pokemon characters to choose from . Go buy them both . You 'll need them to link up to Gold/Silver .	1
the game came in good condition and works properly . Its a great game that has an incredible replay value which I appreciate	1
Pokemon Blue is a great game . This is the game that first got me totally into Pokemon . This game is fun and interesting . You can play this game for a long time . This game does n't really end . There 's always something else to do . In this game you are a guy ( in Crystal , they give you a choice ! Then I actually can quit naming a guy a girl 's name ! ) who catches , raises , and battles Pokemon , which are like animals . Pokemon Blue is a really fun game . Play Pokemon Blue . You 'll be totally into Pokemon . I really highly recommend Pokemon Blue ( and everything else Pokemon . Pokemon ROCKS ! ) .	1
It was great re-living some of my childhood days when playing this game . It actually was kind of challenging trying to remember where to go and how to beat it all over again .	1
Intro : I had Pokemon Blue ever since it was released but lost my copy ever since . I had the other two US Pokemon releases ( Red and Yellow ) and wanted to complete the trilogy again so I searched and found one adequately priced and bought it . ( Luckily no problems with it . ) Plot : Anyone who 's played knows it , but for those of you who do n't . The plot is simple , you , the protagonist embark on a quest to get all 8 gym badges , challenge the elite four , and become a Pokemon Master . Standard vague RPG story-line . I was able to grasp it when I was 7 , so I assume it should n't be too hard to follow . If you manage to get lost you can find an online guide pretty easy now.Game-play : Game-play is simple turn based fighting . One person goes at a time . Pretty normal for an RPG . Players could do team fighters where a max of 6 Pokemon can be used a match , the first to K.O . all of their opponents Pokemon wins . During battle you can attack , switch Pokemon , or use items . ( Run is a forth option if you 're grinding away and training . ) Graphics : Very out dated now , but was good when the game came out.Sound : Like the graphics out dated , but good for when the game came out.Overall : If you 're a Pokemon collector or re-buying a copy like I did to replace a lost one you ca n't go wrong with it .	1
This game started it all . Maybe thats enough to convince you to buy it- the fact it is the first pokemon game , and you want to see what it was like . If it is not- then please read on , and learn why to buy it.First off- this was the first ENGLISH pokemon game . The original pokemon games were in Japan- pokemon green and pokemon red ( not the us version ) . They had different sprites for the pokemon , and they were pretty rough . When they came over here , pokemon blue had already been released in Japan , which was a smoother revised version of the first 2 . Thats where the name blue came from.The graphics ? 8 bit . They arent amazing or anything like that- but its classic , like the first mario . The graphics arent why you play . Its fun and original . Thats why you play it . The Kanto story is basically a trainer who choses from bulbasaur , squirtle , or charmander and journeys around Kanto to become a pokemon master , and ends up stopping team rocket in the proccess . After you beat the champion , you can try to catch the legendary pokemon Mewtwo and the legendary birds if you havnt already done so . You can try to get Missingno , the infamous glitch pokemon- but theres not much to do . As far as replay value goes , theres a large amount of it . Different things can be done , and will greatly alter the outcome of the final battle.If you want a nice , pretty version of this game then go with fire red or leaf green , the remakes . If you want a classic , then go with this . Also , the music is better in this game than the remakes .	1
I first played this game when I was in 5th grade . I instantly fell in love with the simple , yet powerfully captivating quest . This , along with the N64 console and Age of Empires were the heart and soul of my 90 's game experience . Pokemon may have evolved over the years , but this is well and truly where it all began .	1
one of the biggest time wasters of my child hood . I have not replayed this since I bought it , so I 'm not 100 % it holds up to time ...	1
Pokemon Blue is a fabulous game with a very original plot , and two main objectives . It starts off with you , in your house , and you 're ready to start your adventure with Pokemon , creatures that you catch and raise . You try to leave town , but Professor Oak ( a Pokemon expert ) stops you and brings you to his lab . There , he has you choose one of three Pokemon . This is a very important choice . I 'll evaluate each one for you : BULBASAUR : A strong grass type Pokemon . The first two gym leaders are extremely vulnerable to his type , so he is undoubtedly a good choice . He also has a secondary type of poison , which can be a helpful feature . I highly recommend him if you are new to this game.SQUIRTLE : A very strong water Pokemon . He is very good against the first gym leader , but not the second . He is my personal choice . Squirtle is the moderate choice . He 's for either for experienced players who do n't want Charmander , beginner players who do n't want Bulbasaur , or people who 's skill is in between easy and experienced . Ice moves can also be taught to him , which can be an advantage.CHARMANDER : An exceptionally powerful fire Pokemon . He is not very good against the first gym leader , and terrible against the second . He seems to be the most popular choice , although he is the most difficult to train . He does become the best of the three in final form , because he obtains a secondary type of flying.From there , you must catch more Pokemon . You need a party of Pokemon ( you can have up to 6 ) and you raise them , moving from town to town , gaining experience , fighting trainers , obtaining items , and catching new Pokemon . The other objective is to catch all the Pokemon ( 150 in Red & amp ; Blue . ) Some are easy to catch , some difficult , and some you must trade from Red . You see , the only diffrence between Red & amp ; Blue is the distribution of Pokemon ( 11 diffrent in each version . ) Some only in Red , some only in Blue . You must use a link cable between two versions . With the link cable , you can also battle the other person ( but you wo n't gain experience . ) That 's a part of the game.I hope you found this helpful . Good luck on your game !	1
It 's kind of strange how I manged to get into Pokemon , but here 's how it all began : One day , during a Science class , a friend of mine and I were going around our elementary school yard and picking up trash and Tootsie Roll wrappers . The actual goal was as many Tootsie Roll wrappers we each got , that was how many Tootsie Rolls we would get . Anyway , I found a stray Ponyta Pokemon Card in one part of the yard , and my friend found a Dark Charmeleon . My friend said , `` I 'll trade you my Dark Charmeleon for your Ponyta if you want '' . Well , personally , I did n't want to , I wanted to add this card and start a collection , but my friend 's Dark Charmeleon did look sort of cool at the time . I finally gave in and said , `` well , why not ? '' So we traded . A few days later , we started acting out some of the episodes at recess ( I 'd never seen the episodes at the time ) . My friend was basically making up his own little stories ... never mind the episodes that were on TV . Later on , my liking for Pokemon grew when my friend decided to bring his Game Boy Color to school , AND his Pokemon Red Version . I thought to myself , hmmm ... this could be interesting . I asked him what he was playing and if I could watch him play it . he said , `` sure you can watch . '' I did n't get to see much of the game because we were n't outside for recess that long . Then , I decided I wanted to get my own version of Pokemon Red . I asked my mom and she said I could . So I did . I got the game ( almost 7 years later and I still have n't beaten it ) and I ended up loving it . So , in conclusion , I 'm eighteen and a half years old , a junior at Grafton High School , and I still love Pokemon ( the games more than the episodes ) , but one thing has changed ... my friend and I do n't do `` reenactments '' of our favorite episodes anymore like we used to . I really recommend this game .	1
One word : PLAYBACK . My sister first owned this game in 1998 , and since then I have owned MANY Pok & eacute ; mon games for both Game Boy Color and N64 . And let me tell you , the original is always the best ! Pok & eacute ; mon Red and Blue are the best games ever created for Game Boy Color ! I still love these games , trading Pok & eacute ; mon , and battling other people with the Link Cable ! First of all , people of any age can enjoy this game . It is cute and innocent enough to entertain children , but the strategy and the level of gameplay make it a worthwhile game for adults . Everyone will love this game.You start out as a trainer named Ash Ketchum from Pallet Town . Your mission is to become a Pok & eacute ; mon Master by catching 150 Pok & eacute ; mon ( 151 if you count Mew ) and becoming the champion of the Elite Four . To do this , you must train and catch Pok & eacute ; mon , raise them , and even trade them between Red and Blue versions using your Link Cable or the infrared port on your Game Boy Color . This is both fun and time-consuming , which is great when you are at home sick or bored on a stormy day . Pok & eacute ; mon are raised by winning battles and/or using Rare Candy . Raising Pok & eacute ; mon may sound tedious , but you will change your mind about that when you actually play for yourself . Pok & eacute ; mon is addictive from the moment you start your game all the way through . You will meet many new people on the way , become a hero , and win new items and abilities as you go along.As Ash , you travel through the world of Kanto , which is divided into a number of cities and towns . A map will be your guide as you make your way through the vast world of Pok & eacute ; mon . Explore caves , oceans , tall grass , and rocky paths on your way . Each town or city usually has its own Pok & eacute ; mon Gym , with a Gym Leader which is something like a Boss . Each time you beat a Gym Leader you receive a badge . You need eight badges to battle the Elite Four and the current Elite Four Champion . There are different diversions in each city and town , for example , Celadon City 's department store and casino , and one of my personal favorites , Fuschia City 's Safari Zone.Trainers can be found everywhere , good and bad , from Team Rocket invading the radio station , to the gyms , in the water , on the road , and pretty much anywhere you go . Random Pok & eacute ; mon appear and battle you if you are in a cave , tall grass , or in the water . The wild Pok & eacute ; mon you come across are the ones that you can catch if you have Pok & eacute ; balls with you . Items such as the bike and repel can help prevent you from running into too many Pok & eacute ; mon if you are trying to get somewhere . If your Pok & eacute ; mon are tired or injured , you can stop at a Pok & eacute ; mon center and heal them for free ! You can also store Pok & eacute ; mon via a computer terminal located within every Pok & eacute ; mon Center.The music is so cute ! And there is a lot of different music , so it does n't get repetitive.If you are lucky enough to own Pok & eacute ; mon Stadium , you can play Red or Blue on your TV screen using a Transfer Pak ! You can also use the Pok & eacute ; mon you raised on your Red or Blue game to battle in Pok & eacute ; mon Stadium.Overall , this is one of the best games I have ever played . It is still fun after years of gameplay , as you never fully run out of stuff to do . If you want to get into Pok & eacute ; mon , or if you 're an old fan that never quite got around to getting the game , this is the game for you ! Pok & eacute ; maniacs rule !	1
My kids and I all love the Pokemon Gameboys ( the three of us each have our own Gameboy ) . The red Pokemon game is very similar to the blue , with the Yellow having some slight differences.I like the way the Pokemon game challenges kids . I suggest also buying one of the books which shows the various routes and places . This allows kids to work at the tasks without getting frustrated.The idea is to start at Prof. Oak 's house , get your first Pokemon from him , and then journey all around the land of Pokemon , collecting various wild pokemon ( which you catch by battling them until they faint ) , and doing battle with other trainers along the way.In the process , kids learn to manuever through mazes of increasing complexity ( which is why the manuals are a help ) , to gather and use items , and to develop strategies for fighting various types of Pokemon . My five year-old even started to read while using her Gameboy , from needing to know which items she had with her ( in her Item List ) ! All in all these are great games which can be played over and over ( although only one game at a time can be saved ) , and which will provide your kids with hundreds of hours of fun .	1
I have no idea why I still play Pokemon from time to time . I was into it before it became popular , and I still enjoy the games ( not the cards ... ... ) more than 2 years after the fad breathed it 's last . Yes , new titles have been coming out , but no one seems to like them very much and they are not changing the game enough to make them worth buying.Anyway , about the game . You start out as a young boy living with your mother , and set out to become the world 's greatest Pokemon trainer . When you try to leave town , Professer Oak will give you a starter Pokemon ( the only real difference between this one and Yellow is that in Yellow , you MUST start with Pikachu ) . Once you have picked one , you must battle your rival , and then you can leave . The rest is obvious ... The main reason I still like this game is that it has amazing , Zelda-esque depth to it . Many puzzles , and 15 element types of Pokemon . Certain types are stronger against others , while each type has its weaknesses , too . There are a total of 150 Pokemon to be caught . However , some only appear in the Red version and some only in Blue . You must link to the Blue version to catch all 150 ! ( To make this easier , some people buy a Red AND Blue AND a Game Link Cable so they could complete the game on their own ) .Overall , this game is surprisingly fun and amusing , and has a great depth to it which will please many RPG ( role-playing game ) lovers . Great game , so if you like RPGs or adventure games , get this one , if you do n't already have it .	1
thanks you i love Pokemon games and fun games so big fans Pokemon that why i buy them you know thanks you : )	1
Originality 10/10 Unlike nearly all other RPG franchises , this is 100 % original ! Graphics 9+/10 Some Pokemon look better than others.Music 9.5+/10 The music is very good.Replay value 10/10 Even if you get through this game in hours , you may have more to do.Pokemon Red sold 4.83 million in the United States , so this qualifies as an underrated game , due to selling under 5 million units . If you want to buy the best Game Boy game ever , this is where you will find it . ABSOLUTELY NO EXCEPTIONS ! This should have gotten a `` Game Of The Year '' reward or two , but this ( near ) perfect masterpiece NEVER got it . A true Pokemon fan has this gem in his/her collection . However , one thing . Some of these might be worn out ( discolored label , multiple scratches on the back , etc . ) due to being so great of a game . Do n't say I did n't warn you .	1
You love it . I love it . You 're probably just getting this because you lost your original or it 's died out on you . Either way you need to buy it and re-love it all over again .	1
Beyond and above all the hype surrounding the 'Pokemon ' phenomenon , the fact remains that the game at the centre of it all is extremely good fun . Think of the 'Final Fantasy ' games , but without the boring plot bits , and you have 'Pokemon ' - an approachable RPG that seems superficially simple , but has a surprising depth of strategy behind it . From the perspective of a hard-core , long-time gamer it 's heartening to know that something as popular as this does not require a monster PC with a Voodoo5 ( indeed , it could easily be converted for the Commodore 64 ) , and the never-ending , open-ended gameplay is a nice homage to 'Elite ' . The necessity to buy two copies of the game to 'complete ' it , and the massive marketing blitz surrounding the core product is somewhat jading , but do n't let that detract from the essential purity of the original .	1
This game is one of the funest Game Boy Color games ever ! 150 pokemon ? Wow ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! That 's alot ! Who 's cares about graphics in this game , it 's still fun ! The gameplay and sound is reat as well . If you love this game but want better graphics or more stuff to do , then buy FireRed or LeafGreen Version ! They are just as fun ! I 'd reccomend trying at least one of the versions : Red , Blue , Yellow , Silver , Gold , Cristel , FireRed , LeafGreen or Emerald . Do n't get Ruby and Saphire tohugh , they stink .	1
Why are you reading this ? You ALL know how amazing the Pokemon series are . Why be curious ? Why complain ? They are all part of our childhood . They 've been there when technology began enhancing . The Pokeball technology made us believe in the greatness of creativity and virtual reality . They taught us about friendship , achieving goals , patience in gaining more experience to learn better skills , conserving our best skills for the blow that fits best . Why ? Why would anyone else rate differently ? Dude , Pokemon 's awesome . Stop reading this and buy it . Haters can suck on my pokeballs of 600+ Pokemon . I 'm a 24 year old female and proud of playing on my NDS , battling pixelated characters , and collecting them while I am on break in my office . # comeatmebro	1
Always have loved pokemon series and the games . This is definitely my favorite one . Worked good but i bought collectible and it had the previous owners name in sharpie on it . I did n't like that but it works great .	1
It 's true that Pokemon is pretty much a passing craze due to ( for some odd reason ) the invention of TOO MANY POKEMON ! However , this game is amazing . The graphics , attack animations , and sounds are very simple compared to later installments of the series , but who cares ? At the time , this was like nothing anyone had ever played ! The music is extremely catchy , and there are so many things to collect , you 'll just find yourself playing for hours . Also , you can trade Pokemon from other people since the Red and Blue versions have Pokemon exclusive to that version . Also , if you feel the need to `` catch 'em all , '' trade starters , or evolve certain Pokemon with a trade . The bottom line : it 's a great guilty pleasure and introduced what is now the most faded franchise ever !	1
I always preferred blue over red I do n't know why really but I just love this game the classic pokemon rpg	1
I got this game right after getting a game boy advanced for christmas . The game is real easy to learn and play . I can see how this game is so addictive for younger kids . The puzzles are fun , but not difficult . As an adult , it was a fun way to while away the hours . I played for 100 hours before beating it . The only problem I had with this game is that there was only one save . It made it impossible for anyone else to play the game . In fact , my 2 year old son erased my first game ... .	1
This game in my point of view , is better than the latest ones , Mainly because it was new and it was less tedious . The music is repetitive and annoying , but that is what the volume control 's for . After you beat the elite four it gets less fun but being sort of OCD about getting every last unlockable in the game I do n't really mind that much . I think anyone under 13 would like this game .	1
The year was 1998 . I was twelve years old , in middle school , and the Pokemon games debuted in the United States for the very first time . A game so simple and yet at the very same time : So complex . Nothing was more addictive , nothing was more fun than playing Pokemon . If you remember the craze ( the REAL craze , presently it is n't nearly as strong as it was back then ) , then you remember what it was like to go to school back in those days . Suddenly EVERYONE had a Gameboy . Suddenly even those who did n't normally play games or even know what the hell a Gameboy was , had it . And you 'd go up to your friends and you 'd trade Pokemon , you 'd taunt each other about who was the better champion when you battled . You got in arguments over who the best starter was . Then you learned of those glitches to get all your Pokemon to level 100 by duplicating the Rare Candies . You caught Missingno and M-Block and caught Safari Zone Pokemon by exploiting what may very well be one of the most widely known glitches in video game history . And of course , you went to catch them all , and you probably had that ONE friend who you deemed your rival and you had to catch 'em all before he did . If you remember all this , you 're a true Pokemon fan . This is n't a myth , this game debuted , sold gazillions of copies and started a craze that -- while it is n't as strong -- still exists today . This was one of the heights of gaming period.The Red and Blue versions may have seen stateside release in 1998 , but the game was actually made in 1995 . Before the television show came around . When the TV series took off in America , the games came next and as I said , they sold more copies than the latest installment of Harry Potter . I 'm not kidding.Red and Blue began almost everything you currently see in the series today . The game begins with you naming your character ( you could n't choose between a boy or a girl in this one ) and then your rival . Again , if you had Pokemon fever you probably named your main character Ash and your rival was named Gary ( even the strategy guides referred to them as such ) . It began with Professor Oak letting you have a Pokemon of your choice ( between 3 starters ) and then ultimately he 'd send you on a journey with a Pokedex and have you document the Pokemon you 'd find . Along the way , you 'd have to deal with Team Rocket , the bad guys who are always causing trouble and stealing everyone 's Pokemon , as well as gather eight badges so you could challenge the Elite Four and become a Pokemon League Champion . The entire formula began here , and just about everything mentioned above has been done in each and every main series Pokemon game hereafter.What was perhaps the strangest thing about Pokemon is that the game was surprisingly deep in terms of combat . It was your traditional turn-based combat . Simple , yet it was so complex . For one , the game has a Rock/Paper/Scissors method to it . Every Pokemon has a type , and every type has its own strengths and weaknesses . For example , Water is strong up against fire but it is weak vs. Grass . Grass is weak vs. fire etc . etc . No Pokemon is invincible . They all have a weakness to some type . Though in these versions the psychics definitely have an unfair advantage as the type they 're weak against ( bug ) is almost non-existent and there are hardly any bug type attacks.In the battle menu you 're given a list of commands . Fight , Item , PKMN , or Run . You can switch Pokemon you 've caught in and out of battle on the fly , but it 'll usually cost you a turn . It 's the strategic portion of Pokemon that makes battling fun and addictive . As you go through the game you 'll be challenged by trainers and you never know what they 'll throw at you ! It 's completely unpredictable and some of them are tough . It 's also interesting because with 150 different Pokemon , the amount of teams you can make are endless , and it really makes you think about what types you want in your roster . Because most of the Pokemon types are weak vs. more than just one type . It 's also important that you give them a variety of moves , as the moves are also typed . On paper it does n't seem like much , but when you actually play the game , you 'll find a clog in your drain you did n't even know you had because you thought your team was perfect ... but then that one Pokemon comes along and exposes your fatal flaw.Pokemon was no short game . It was full of all sorts of side quests . From the Safari Zone , to catching the Legendary Birds , to the Unknown Dungeon . There was plenty to do , and even after the game was over there was STILL more to accomplish . Of course , your main accomplishment was getting them all . Pokemon could easily keep you busy for well over 60 hours . In 1998 this is an amazing feat seeing as how most RPGs of TODAY do n't keep you busy that long . The main quest itself only took a measly 15 hours or so , but all the extra content kept you on your toes.Even more , Pokemon was one of the few Gameboy Games that made excellent use of the link cable . Since Red and Blue versions had different Pokemon , some only appeared in certain versions . You could n't for example , catch a Magmar in the Red version , but you could in Blue . How then , were Red players supposed to catch all 150 ? By trading . Until Pokemon came around , my link cable was collecting dust . Trading was usually a slow grueling process , though . Traded Pokemon also got an experience boost so they were easier to train.Even more exciting than trading , however , was what really made Pokemon a blast to play : Battling . You and your friends could get together and battle one another ! Test out your Pokemon teams against your friends . They were , more often not , far better to battle against than the games trainers . It 's always interesting to see who your opponents heavy hitter is . With your friends it was always interesting . Imagine how embarrassed you were to say a certain Pokemon sucked only to discover that the trainer actually did a good job training ? As far as the game looks and sounds , it did n't really look all that great when it was released in 1998 ( it was after all , a game made in 1995 ) . On the original gameboy it was pretty grainy ( but very clear on the Gameboy Pocket ) and of course it was black or white ( unless you played it on a Super Gameboy or Gameboy Color ) . For a Gameboy game , though , it actually was n't too bad . It was annoying to watch a Pokemon simply flinch to attack , and some of the animations were n't all that great , but it was to be expected due to the Gameboy 's limitations . The music , however , was fantastic . The tunes were catchy -- particularly the trainer battles and gym leader battles . The only really annoying thing was the sound effects . They were n't all that great , and its a shame that Nintendo actually continues to use those exact same sound effects in Pokemon games today . Still , for what it 's worth , this was the game you wanted on the Gameboy.Pokemon is a classic . It 'll always be a classic . No matter who you are , if you played Pokemon ten years ago , the craze was completely undeniable . If you got addicted like I did , chances are you 're still playing today . Because in its core , the game was far deeper than you thought it was , and the series continues to use that same basic formula even today .	1
dont be a fool ! play pokemon blue ! ok enough of the word puns . this game is awesome . you 'll ignore the late 90s graphic shortcomings with your love for pokemon . only recomended for true fans	1
It 's a classic , what 's not to love ? I bought this as I already had blue , so I could play with my kid brother who is still in this age range and we could trade ( I mean I never actually got all the pokemon back in the day since I had no one to trade with , ca n't leave a task undone now can we ? ) .	1
My son is really into Pok & eacute ; mon and he loves this game . He is into collecting all the Pok & eacute ; mon games he can and loves having added this one .	1
Pokemon Blue is amazing . It is n't as good as some of the recent Pokemon games , but its still a wonderful game . Not so heavy on plot , your main objective is to catch all 150 of the Pokemon to complete your Pokedex and to stop Team Rocket . Catching Pokemon is not as easy as it sounds . They will fight hard and almost always break the Pokeballs you try to catch them in . It gets addicting after a while though , and soon your team is filled with interesting creatures . It is almost like training a pet , you can teach them special moves to defeat your opponents , and if you use them a lot they will `` evolve '' .Graphics : C- , the Pokemon are n't near as cute or detailed as they are in future versions . The black/white display is n't so fun either.Sound : D , I have never heard worse scores in my life . It is repetitive , dull , and will give a headache in less then 2 minutes.Storyline : B , Nice and short . I could n't ask for anything better.Fun : A , Even with minor repetition I still find the game to be a blast.Overall , the game is % 100 a classic . Buy it or you will never be a true gamer .	1
By now every man , woman andchild has heard of pokemon , and it 's reputation . The cute little animals you catch in a ball and then force to fight eachother has captured the hearts of kids in America , and the wallets of parents . Many people hate this game with out even giving it a try . Why is that , the overly priced , merchandice , the barbaric card game ( banned in many elementary schools and pre schools nation wide ) and terrible TV show and average movies ... When looking at all the [ stuff ] it 's easy to forget the concept , and enjoyment of the game itself.The game is an RPG , meaning experience building and random battles , all in a quest ( in this case ) to become the best . You have a rival ( who you name ) and the two of you compete through out the entire game.because this is on Gameboy ( before Color ) the graphics are dull , plain , boring . However after getting past that you have a very deep , very fun , and very addicting game . Catching 151 of the creatures ( 151 through either gameshark or Pokemon Conventions ) and in these cases it is a little difficult to put the game down.Overall the game is worth playing because it is a lot of fun , forget the [ stuff ] that it spawned and play the first game , if you are an RPG Fan you will not be disapointed .	1
This is a great classic game . You begin as a new Pokemon trainer , and soon select your first Pokemon . The choices are Charmander , a fire type ; squirtle , a water type ; or bulbasaur , a fire type . Interestingly , three Pokemon you choose from are like rock/paper/scissors , charmander beats bulbasaur , squirtle beats charmander , and bulbasaur beats squirtle . Soon , you rival chooses his Pokemon ( annoyingly , its always the one that has the type advantage , like if you choose squirtle he will choose charmander . You are then given the task of completing a complete guide of Pokemon by catching all of them . In order to beat the game , you only need the first 150 Pokemon , however , there is also a legendary number 151 Mew . You catch Pokemon by using one you already have to weaken it , then catching it with a Pokeball . Once you catch a Pokemon , you may use it to fight others , but you can only have up to 6 Pokemon at a time . Along the way , you will encounter other trainers you may battle . There are regular trainers , which you battle only for money , fun , and experience . However , there are also gym leaders , which are specialized trainers with stronger Pokemon than regular trainers in their area have . There are 8 in all , and once you beat them , you may then battle the elite four , who are much tougher than gym leaders and you have to fight all of them in succession . You also encounter your rival throughout the game . And he becomes Pokemon League Champion , however , once you defeat him , you become Pokemon League Champion . There are also troublemaking team rocket members that you can and sometimes have to battle as well . Their boss is also the leader of gym 8 . I have found the gym leaders and team rocket members are actually exceedingly easy if you know what you 're doing , however , the elite 4 is very tough , especially since you have to face them all toghether . There are also legendary Pokemon , which are considered to be part of the 151 total , and they are very rewarding but challenging to catch . Also , one cool thing is there is a lot of moves ( although some are kind of stupid ) and certain Pokemon have strengths over others . For example , fire takes out grass easily . However , you can beat the game just by having stronger Pokemon , however , this is actually harder than using strategy . Because it takes a great length of time to level up , while a skilled player can quickly catch a Pokemon with a type advantage . And to the guy who said he beat this game in a hour ... .if you think this game is easy , than you should quit playing videogames altoghether , because you obviously are such a great master of everything . Also , IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BEAT THE GAME IN A HOUR ! AT MINIMUM , YOU HAVE TO PLAY IT FOR AT LEAST LIKE 20 HOURS FOR YOUR POKEMON TO BE HIGH ENOUGH LEVEL TOO ! Oh , wait , you must have used a gameshark . Wow , no wonder you are so good at videogames . But if anyone tells you they beat the game in a hour , they either cheated , found a big glitch , or both . Or else their exaggerating . But the only way the game could really beat that easy is if you had a strategy guide . `` Oh this game is so easy , I only had to read 50 books on it to beat it on the first try . '' GET REAL ! IF THIS IS N'T A CHALLENGE , NOTHING IS ! Overall , its a great game , but there are some annoying things . First off , to get all 151 , you must trade with freinds , as neither red nor blue has every Pokemon , but they do combined . Most Pokemon are in both versions , but some are exclusive to either red or blue . Also , as you level up your Pokemon , they evolve ( which is really more accurately described as metamorphises ) , and some only evolve by trading them with the same Pokemon with another player . Another thing is there is only one save slot . Finally , in the Japenese version , by getting the first 150 , you get number 151 , but in the US version you can only get them through Nintendo 's promotions or by cheating . Hmm , giving Americans a raw deal , aye Nintendo ? You know we buy into your promotions instead of demanding that you make stuff available in the games . In Japan , gamers would be outraged , but you know you can take advantage of us Americans ? Okay , go ahead . But despite the fact that it is n't as good as the Japenese version or a perfect game , Pokemon Red is still one of my favorites .	1
The Phantom Menace takes you on a journey through the great moments of the film . It features very sharp looking graphics with a third person view ( a la Tomb Raider . ) There are many puzzles within the actions scenes . Each of the levels are pretty long and will take time for you to complete . The hardest of which is when you first meet & quot ; the mysterious little boy. & quot ; There is n't much to say bad about the game except that it could have benefited from being first person rather than 3rd . Some of the camera angles are weird . Other than that , this is a very solid effort .	1
star wars episode I the phantom menace is a awesome movie a classic the best of the best the greatest movie in the world george lucas is a god the greatest film director in the world and the phantom menace video game is just as good buy this game if your a huge star wars fan you wont be sorry	1
THis game is older yes , but its a great game and for the cheap price its a must have game . But you need an older computer that runs windows XP .	1
This is a very good game in a way that when you has seen the film you just have to get as the play is just so like the film . The game play is very like the film in many ways as if you split up the film in to sections then this game has a level in each piece of the film . You can even follow the story while playing it . So you do n't have to have seen the film to appreciate this game but it will help as you will know what is happening throughout . It is quite a hard game to get used to but once you do , it becomes really good from there on and you ca n't get off of it as it is very addictive as you want to get to the next section of the film . The good thing is that it is not only just an action game like you would think but also very much a strategy one having to figure out where to go next . And to top it off you even play as queen amidala in one level ! If you love the film like i do then you will love this ! !	1
this game is a Classic Star wars Game at first when playing this game i thought it was stupid but then i played it more and found it really quite good the story line is good and i like how you can choose what the characters say sometimes ... ..i love the podrace levels with jabba the hut those levels are really fun if you are a star wars fan or enjoy good fun get this game	1
This is a very Good game . It is so good . You get to play a lot of diffrent characters , like , Obi-Wan Kenobi , Qui-Gon Jinn , Queen Amidala & Captian Panaka . It woyuld be cool if they let you play Jar Jar Binks , but they do n't . Oh , weel . Jar jar is one of my Favorite Characters in the film . the best part is you get to battle darth Maul . and it goes along with the movie too . This game rocks . This is a must have game for all star wars fans.If you liked this game then check out all of the other Star wars games	1
I 've played this game many , many times . But unfortunately , it 's one of those games that you will either love or hate , which you can tell by the reviews here and I love it.This game is pretty lengthly , gives you a choice of things to say in response to questions and is overall fun , especially since you get to play the entire movie . I recommend this game to die hard fans , but like I said , do n't be surprised if for some reason you do n't like it . Some do , some do n't . Simple as that	1
Everything was in good shape when it arrived . It arrived in a timely manner . It completed my set of Star Wars games for the PSONE . It went well with my set .	1
I bought this game because I played it before on my PS2 . I know the graphics are n't that great but the storyline follows the movie somewhat closely ... I am having a blast reminiscing the old times ...	1
Its a great game and really fun but also challenging at time . The game basically follows the movie with some extras here and there . The graphics are not the greatest but that is to be expected since its a Playstatin game . But overall i would say its a fun game and replayable .	1
I love the three person tag teams , the trios run togeather , but you can tag the next leader by pushing circle . Every character on each team has their own special moves , but the teams are all pretty well balanced , they all have a fast hero , a strong hero , and a hero that can fly.The grapics are great , fast and great ! It has a great third person view , the camera is behind and above the team , you can move to either side , you can jump up , you can fall down , it 's just a great 3D game ! It 's soo easy and plays smoth , my only complaint is it that it is too fast in some places , like in the giant loops I easily lose track of the Sonic , with him moveing from side to side he will run off a cliff and I wo n't notice it until he is dead	1
Sonic Heroes ! Sonic freaking Heroes . Gosh I love this game , I remember loving it as a kid and I still love it now that I 'm older and playing it again . I like having four different unique teams and stories to play and the play style is a lot of fun too . You should definitely get this game if you are a fan of Sonic !	1
Who does not love someSonic . Our six year old reallywanted this game and only played it afew times . Will pick another game toplay instead . All personal preference .	1
The kids love it . A 3D twist to the classic sonic series . Some interesting gaming inclusions that often catch you off guard.Recommended .	1
I have heard many negative things about this game , but I had to try it for myself.I got hooked on it the minute I started playing.The story may be a little sketchy , but it is the gameplay that matters the most right ? You still get the same high good-looking jumps and loop-de-loops , but the actual fighting is one of the best parts.You get excellent combo moves and on Team Dark and Sonic a nicely well-done finisher attack.All four teams have a finisher attack , but half of them are stupid . What really caught my eye is the two player battle mode.There is something about knocking a team off a cliff is entertaining to me . I also agreed with some of the other people.Team Rose is corny , and falling off a cliff is way too easy , but over all , this is one of the best and most original games I have ever played .	1
Sonic Heroes is a lovely platformer . Lately I have been hearing people saying terrible things about this game , as well as other 3D Sonic platformers . Here is my message for them : WHAT 'S WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE ? ! It 's true that Sega has n't exactly perfected the camera system for this game as well as the other Sonic 3D games , but please give Sega some credit for this good platformer . To start with the good in this game , and there is a lot of it , the voice overs are totally sweet . I normally do n't pay much attention to the voices of the characters , as they little interest me , but this game struck a cord there . Each voice , matches his or her corresponding character 's personality , species , and gender perfectly ! There is no question about it . The graphics are good , regardless of the very occasional jerky camera , and the video clips and the stories are also some of the best I have seen . How each story begins , collides with other stories , and ends is masterpiece , and unlike many other games , once you finish a story , you can watch all of the movie clips of that story in the options menu ! The music totally rocks , especially the team themes , and the levels all have a good moral lesson for kids : that you need to work with others as a team ! Speaking of team , this game is very team oriented , the teams are : Team Rose : which consists of Amy Rose , Cream the Rabbit ( and , as always , accompanied by Cheese the chao ) , and Big the Cat . This team has adventures that are beginner difficulty . This is good for young children , and getting beginners used to the game . You may also enjoy this team 's cuteness.Team Sonic : this consists of Sonic the Hedgehog , Miles `` Tails '' Prower , and Knuckles the Echidna . This team has a journey that is a little harder , normal difficulty to be exact . This is good for those who want a little more of a challenge , and enjoy the light bantering of this somewhat humorous team.Team Chaotix : the members of this group include Espio the Chameleon , Charmy the Bee , and Vector the Crocodile ( who is apparently `` The Head Honcho '' ) . This team 's adventures have been dubbed `` dubious '' . The difficulty , in my opinion , varies from easy to hard . If you like detectives , mystery , and treasure hunting , this team is for you . Most of their missions consist of finding a certain amount of something ( five keys for example ) . Not all of them , but most of them . My last comment on them is : this is easily the most comical team in the game . I have been set off laughing by a comment from these dudes several times . You should have fun with them.Team Dark : this team has Shadow the Hedgehog , Rouge the Bat , and Omega ( who is an ex-eggman robot ) . The mercenaries of this team are shrouded in mystery . First off , I must comment that it 's like a soap opera for children , that they brought Shadow back from his presumed death , and with amnesia included . This team has hard difficulty , and often makes you go farther in the levels than you would normally have to with other teams . This group would be extremely boring if it was n't for Rouge . Shadow and Omega take things very seriously , which makes Rouges role the person who lightens things up . It 's an interesting contrast of personalities.So , like I stated earlier , I believe it is good for children to see teams of all kinds . This basically teaches them you can team up with others , no matter how different they are , and work together on a task to make it easier . Moving on , Sega also brings the special stages to 3D . That 's right , rather than collecting the emeralds in the storyline ( like with the Sonic Adventure series ) you actually have to collect a key , hightail it out of the level without getting hit , and complete a special stage in order to get a chaos emerald . Oh , and true to form , the last special stage is once again the hardest . There is also the `` Last Story '' that I will not go into detail here , but trust me , get all seven chaos emeralds and access it . It is definitely worthwhile . The only flaws I have to list for you is these:1 . Because of all of the team action , each individual lost something move wise . I am talking about things like Knuckles ' gliding and climbing abilities as well as Sonic 's somersaulting . Big no longer fishes like he did in Sonic Adventure , and the flight characters ( Tails , Cream , Charmy , and Rouge ) can not fly as long or fast as they originally could . Which sadly makes sense , seeing as those little things are carrying all of the weight of the rest of their teams . Their cool team moves make up for most of the lost abilities , but you still have to miss Knuckles ' climbing skills in those tight situations.2 . The flight members each have a special attack that they can do alone , but there is little point to them having it , seeing as they are almost never alone . So your stuck just doing thundershoot . While powerful , I do believe flying characters lack variety in their abilities.3 . The camera does n't operate 100 % smoothly . It is slightly better than Sonic Adventure 2 : Battle , and does n't matter much anyway however.4 . There is n't enough variety in the chaotix missions . It 's always either find a certain amount of something , sneak past someone , or get from point A to point B before time runs out . I guess it would be difficult to make it more than that , but still , the missions lack that `` investigative '' thing that detectives do.5 . There is no water to swim in . This is n't exactly a huge problem , but I did enjoy confronting and swimming in bodies of water the other games throw at you . Here , the only water you get is Seaside Hill and it behaves more like a bottomless pit . It would have been interesting to see how each team adapted to a swimming pool , and maybe see what funny thing Sonic would have to say.6 . Finally , the zones are not as expansive . It just puts you on one path and makes you go forward . The advantage with this is that you can never get lost , but it loses that `` go wherever you want to '' charm.That 's it . The 2 player mode is also great for those who are interested , and Omochao ( a robotic chao ) can colorfully guide you through the menus . This game is well thought , well planned , and well designed . There is even a zone for pinball fans in Casinopolis so this game has something for absolutely everyone . GET THIS GAME ! Trust me , you will get hours of enjoyment from it .	1
This title marks Sonic 's first launch on more than one platform ... three to be exact . Finally a Sonic title is available on , not only Game Cube , but PlayStation 2 and XBox as well . The Story : Dr. Eggman has devised a new plan to take over the world , a newly reincarnated , and upgrated , Metal Sonic . That 's right , Sonic 's old rival from Sonic CD is back and ready for all new mayhem . It will take more than one hero to foil Eggman this time , It 'll take twelve . But when Metal Sonic gets enough power to change into the all mighty Metal Overlord , will Sonic and his friends be enough to stop him ? Heroes features a uniqe team based gameplay which includes four teams of three including : Team Sonic ( Sonic , Tails and Knuckles ) , Team Rose ( Amy , Big and new comers Cream and Cheese ) , Team Chaotix ( Vector , Espio and Charmy ) , and Team Dark ( Shadow , Rouge and new comer E-123 OMEGA ) . To add to the fun , each team has their own themed challenge i.e . Rose is easy , Sonic is medium , Dark is Hard and Chaotix is mission based . Also each member has their own affiliation : speed , flight and power . The game will tell you where you will need to use each character 's uniqe skills . Overall , it 's a bit challenging for a Sonic title , but it 's worth checking out .	1
This is a very fun game for kids and kid-like adults ( like me ) who are kind of nostalgic about the good old days playing Sega Genesis and NES , and watching AoStH and Sonic SatAm . This has some old ( speed and loop-de-loops ) and some new . Graphics are ok . I expect Sonic to be cartoony and I do n't understand people who complain about it.I really enjoy the teams feature although I tend to abuse the power characters ( ie . Knuckles , Mr. Big the Cat , Omega , and Vector ) . Each team has 3 members each attributed with either speed , power , or flight . Typically you will be required to use them all in each level . Also certain teams are easier to play than others with Team Rose the easiest.Here is a quick breakdown of the teams : Team Sonic : Sonic , Knuckles , and Tails . Sonic is the speed character , Knuckles is power , and Tails is flight.Team Dark : Shadow ( speed ) , Rouge ( flight ) , and Omega ( power ) .Team Chaotix : Vector ( power ) , Charmy ( flight ) , and Espio ( speed ) .Team Rose : Amy Rose ( speed ) , Cream and Cheese ( flight ) , and Mr. Big ( power ) .	1
I was hesitant about buying yet another Sonic game . However , my grandson absolutely loves this game , and honestly I enjoy playing it with him too . It is very entertaining .	1
How can Shadow be back ! ? *SPOILER WARNING*Did n't he die in Sonic Adventure 2 : Battle ? *SPOILERS OVER*Can someone please explain to me how is it possible for Shadow to be back ? Thanks to anyone who helps me . P.S . I just gave it 5 stars because I like Sonic games .	1
When I first got this game , ( my cousins bought that for my birthday ) I put it in my PS2 and play it . It 's like you gather three of your friends and save the world yadayadayada ... Of course I like Shadow for some reason . He 's fast.And one fact . Shadow has rocket boosters , so he runs like he 's roller skating.The music goes great especially its main theme . Some of the songs I make a MIDI file of it . I 'm already done with Rail Canyon.About these AIs . Their good . Especially they were using Team Sonic ( after Lost Jungle Zone ) . Good AI . Their good ( seriously ) .The graphics were great . Word on the street says that voiceovers were poor.I really like Shadow 's voice in Japanese and English ( seriously ) .Do n't question me about the 6th Paragraph ok ? The Special Stages were challenging especially getting the chaos emerald . It 's fun to play it with 2player . The First one was easy you just had collect links and race to the finish line . It was just the same thing compared to the other SEGA games which involves Sonic.Team Chaotix is not really my style . Team Dark is really my style because sometimes , I have a destructive mind.Metal Sonic and Hyper Shadow are one of these guys you will face in the stages after Egg Emperor and Final Fortress.Metal Sonic and Hyper Shadow are playable in Shadow the Hedgehog , and I still do n't know if you can play as them in this game .	1
Granted , it feels all wrong playing Sonic with a PS 2 pad , but I know I speak for us all when I say I 'd rather have Sega Games this way than not at all .	1
For me , this game is just about as fun as Sonic Adventure 2 . It will keep you going for a pretty long time if you wan na beat the game with all 4 storylines . And , who does n't ? The controls , for the most part , are pretty good . Although , there a times where you can accidentally be swinging a weapon and you 'll swing yourself right off a cliff and die . That will happen more than once to you.My biggest problem with the game is the camera sometimes . Especially when flying , the camera will be in a position where you ca n't see the ground below you so you 'll have to guess as where to land . And you WILL guess wrong at least once . And you will die.I 'm not sure , but I think the PS2 version is missing some textures . Particularly when flying , the shadow below the characters is missing . The shadow is critical for knowing where you will land . Without it , it just makes things all the more difficult . I think the shadow is present in the Gamecube version.But I love the level designs and the missions . I do n't find them overly difficult . They 're a challenge but that 's a good thing.If you 're a Sonic fan , this is a must have .	1
this game requires the eye to play it you see yourself playing in the game . thought any one who never saw the game but thought it was just another sega game should know it requires the eye to play .	1
I have played this game all the way through about 4 times and it never gets old ! It 's such an entertaining game . If you do n't own this game I would highly recommend it . The game shipped quickly and there was virtually no damage to the disk or the box .	1
A very fun game that has to do with teamwork ! I do n't understand why they did n't make it co op , but it 's still fun playing both single and 2-player modes . It 's also one of my favorite Sonic character 's debut ! E-123 Omega ! I still think they should have put Mighty in the game , I do n't know why they had to kick him out when he 's a member of the Chaotix . And should n't Knuckles be in Team Chaotix , too ? I still think this is better than many of the new Sonic titles , and , although the graphics are n't PS3 amazing , they 're good for a PS2 game . The game 's good for a Sonic fan at any age , you do n't have to be a hardcore video gamer or a Sonic fan to love this game ( although I 'm both ^_^ ) .	1
Remember old Sonic on the Megadrive ? How it was all about FUN and SPEED , and not the exploration and questing that the latter Dreamcast sequels seemed to have in abundance ? Well , Kids , Sonic is back and better than ever and now , thanks to some extremely brave and very , very well-executed gameplay changes , regains his foothold as the best platform hero in the world , bar none : - ) Granted , it feels all wrong playing Sonic with a PS 2 pad , but I know I speak for us all when I say I 'd rather have Sega Games this way than not at all.Sonic Heroes consists of all the usual levels - Seaside Hill Zone , Casino Nite Zone , etc. , but it 's in the teamwork where this game excels . Now , instead of just playing as one Hedgehog or one Echidna or one Bat or whatever , you have to employ teamwork across a cast of three characters per level in order to beat the game . There are 4 teams , so 12 playable characters in all - and range from Staples like Team Sonic ( Sonic , Knuckles and Tails ) to past characters ( Rose the Bat , Big the Cat and Espiosa the ... purple thing ) to downright oddball characters ( Charmy the Bee , for instance ) . On each team , one character is good for speed , one for strength and one for flying , and you do need to make good use of each character to beat the level you 're currently playing . Also , the teams are graded in terms of difficulty , so beginners can start with Team Rose and work their way up , frustration-free.This adds a huge sense of fun to the game , as well as keeping the Sonic concept fresh and exciting : hedgehog-runs-along-flat-plane is dull-dull-dull , but for the speed freaks the bonus levels are all about speed , and highly reminiscent of the Bonus Stages from Sonic 2 . Similarly excellent is the presentation , as one would expect from a Sega game - there are a wealth of options to be unlocked , like new modes of play , the fabulous CG movies , different voices for the characters etc . - all of which makes for an excellent gaming experience.Thoroughly recommended , this is another feather in Sega 's cap and one of my personal favourite Sonic games to date . Enjoy !	1
THIS SONIC GAME IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES , IT RULES ! THIS GAME SADLY ONLY INTRODUCES TWO NEW CHARACTERS , AND THAT 'S OMEGGA AND CHOCHOLA.YOU CAN PLAY AS SONIC , TAILS , KNUCKLES , AMY , CREAM , CHEESE , BIG , OMEGGA , SHADOW , ROUGE , VECTOR , CHARMY , ESPIO , SUPER SONIC , SOLAR TAILS AND HYPOR KNUCKLES.EGGMAN , METAL SONIC , CHAOS , FROGGY CHOCHOLA AND A BUNCH OF CHAOS ALSO APPEAR IN THE GAME BUT YOU CA N'T PLAY AS THEM.THE GAME HAS A MULTIPLAYER MODE WITCH IS ALOT OF FUN .	1
Sonic Heroes will be EXTREMELY AWESOME ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I have n't played it yet , but I know it will be great , and hopefully the bad camera views from the Adventure series will be vanished.When I say A blast from the past , I mean that Sonic Heroes is one of his old games , blown up into 3D , ( New stages , of course ... ) I ca n't think of anything else to put ! Just get Sonic Heroes when it comes out cuz IT'TL ROCK !	1
first off this game is soo not boring it is really fun , second off THERE ARE NO GLICTHES I HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME EVER AND THE CAMERA DOES KEEP UP WITH YOU ! ! ! ! and third off this game is not hard repeat that sentance ten times i beat it in half a week and got all the bonous stuff and keys and everything i beat it with team sonic team rose team choatix and with team dark witch means it is on hard P.S . the one reviewer who said this game gave his kid nightmares , HOW THE HECK CAN YOU GET NIHGTMARES FROM A SONIC GAME AND HOW CAN YOU GET SO MAD YOU START TO CRY THAT REALLY PUZZLES ME THE GRAPHICS ARE GREAT TO , OVERALL THIS GAME IS VERRY GOOD	1
This game surpassed my already high expectations . When I first played it I was rather skeptical , but it is a very fun game . The levels to do are immense . The characters all have their own unique styles of fighting , and the missions are amazingly fun.TEAMSI 'll go a little bit in depth about the special teams you can choose from . First up is Team Sonic , which is Sonic , Knuckles , and Tails . Sonic is good for speed , Knuckles for power , and Tails for flying . Let me just say right now I HATE Tails 's voice . Cream 's and Charmy 's too . Just because they 're little kids does n't mean they need to sound dumb . And how can Sonic be 8 ? ! There is no way . I still think he 's at LEAST 17.Team Chaotix : By far my favorite team . I love Vector , he 's so awesome . This team is more or less based on certain missions to do , not exactly getting through the stages . You have to find certain things , or defeat a certain number of enemies , or things like that . This team is for people who want something different . HATE Charmy 's voice.Team Dark : This is a team for more intermediate players . The levels are a bit longer , and the puzzles are more confusing . But still , it 's a fun team to be . The voice acting for them are okay , I just wish Shadow sounded like he did in Shadow the Hedgehog.Team Rose : HATE Cream 's voice . These levels are easier and shorter , these are for beginning players and younger players as well . The levels are not hard to figure out , nor are they very long . If you want a challenge , I suggest trying Team Chaotix . I adore Big , but Amy is kind of stupid . The way she obsesses over Sonic is rather creepy , but whatever.All in all , the game is great . I have been playing it and it is so cool . Keep in mind , it does get tiresome if you keep dying and have to start from the same checkpoint over and over , so be sure to hit the checkpoints.By the way , Espio is a chameleon ! OVERALL SCOREGameplay : 10/10Voice acting -- Knuckles -- goodSonic -- goodTails -- HORRIBLEVector -- goodEspio -- NICECharmy -- HORRIBLEAmy -- ehhBig -- okayCream -- -HORRIBLEShadow -- ehhRouge -- sounds a little like a manE-102 Omega -- LOLGraphics : 10/10Overall score : 87/100	1
This was a great buy for the N64 . I was inspired to buy this game after seeing the movie scene with the Podracing . So all an all you start off as a noob and work your way to the top buying parts for your pod . You can choose from many racers . I give this game the rating that it got for its fun with some frustrating races .	1
This is the best racing game since Mario kart . The vehicles are cool and you get to play cool characters and go through cool courses . This is a must have racing game.If you liked this game then check out all of the other star wars games .	1
Well , I love moving this fast in a vgame . I enjoyed playing in the Tatooine course , and the made-up levels actually seem like real STAR WARS designs , unlike Rogue Squadron 2 . Often you 're racing through a level , and you kind of want to stop playing ... .but you do n't , because you want to make the next turn , or just love peacefully gliding over the land at that speed . I never got into tuning up the racers , maybe there 's something lacking there . You are n't often right beside the other pod , it would have been nice to implement an element of slamming into the other pod to have a fun/dangerous fight while performing the race , if that option were here and was fun , it would provide an all-new level of depth/excitement to the game , maybe if you had to avoid Subulba like the film . I thought I heard there will be a sequel to this game , hopefully they will optimize it for the next-gen systems like Xbox , because they did n't when this was merely ported to Sega Dreamcast . A sequel would make a cool online game , but make they could introduce AOTC areas or make a 3-4 more Tatooine levels . The graphics here are very smudgey , I would advise getting the PC or DC version or something , but it 's worth getting as it is so [ inexpensive ] now .	1
I am not much of a star wars fan but this game is fun . I found it for $ 3 at a used game store . It was worth it . Its actually more fun when playing multiplayer and with the steering wheel . I also enjoyed the star wars game shadow of the empire .	1
Of course anyone who owns an N64 wants an epic Star Wars game mixed with the sheer speed of Mario Kart , and this game is the baby from both Lucasarts and Nintendo 's endeavors . With the Expansion Pak , Graphics look well rounded and nice to look at , and the track selections throughout the game bring that nostalgic feeling back into the air as you relive your fantasy of being a space cowboy wielding a lightsaber . Perfect for any hardcore race fan or Star Wars geek !	1
You need the expansion pack -- which is n't that expensive nowadays . If you love racing games than this game is for you . This game is fun and challenging . You go around racing in different planets . Plus you can upgrade your vehicle . For the N64 the graphics are pretty good . You ca n't really compare it with the newer games . Like I said before , some tracks are really easy while others.. HA.. are hard . I mean really hard.This game is perfect for killing time .	1
I am no fan of star wars , however , this is a really great game that has gotten a bad rap , because it came with N64 systems . First off the graphics can not be beaten , everything is extremely detailed from the textures to the fact that every part of the pod racers moves and shutters . This game offers more than one dozen pod racers and drivers , each is unique with unique speeds , skills , traction breaks and so on , each pod racer must be earned though by coming in first for the race where the pod racer is featured . Along the way you pick up `` cash '' from bets that you come in first , second or third , then you use this cash to buy better parts to your pod racer and pit droids to quickly repair your racer . This is a highly imaginative game complete with three major circuits and a special circuit , in terms of the courses themselves I am a fan of racing games and nothing has ever gotten this amazing , jumps that will take your breath away , ice caverns that try to trick you , anti gravity tubes that will let you fly , swamps that will boggle your mind and speeds to boggle your mind too . The difficulty in the races range from circular to near impossible , with eruptions of fire and snipers shooting at you from high above . For Amazon 's price , you need to get this game !	1
This is the best game I ever played !	1
This is a very fun game , possibly the best `` racing game '' I have played . I normally find them very dull , `` Nascar 64 anyone ? '' However , as a racing game , I enjoyed this immensely.Here is the flipside . This game is not NEAR as good as , say Hydro Thunder , or Need for Speed . The best thing about this game is the multiplayer , as the single player gets old fast.My reccomendation , find a friend , rent the game , and have fun !	1
I remember playing this game on someone elses N64 before ! So I wanted to buy it for mine ! I heard people giving this game a lot of false crap . Bragging lies from the pointless haters group that are just in it for the spotlight . I played this game and had lots of fun I even played 2 player against my friend Mark after he tried he said , `` This has become my favorite RACING GAME ! '' OOOH ! That says a lot too the backslammers of this product ! HAAA !	1
this was a cool game at the time but n 64 is over and soon xbox 360 will rule all consoles so get an xbox now and then get 360 not some lame playstation that will be a copy of the first xboxsony sucks big time	1
This game is about some sort of Boeing Aircraft flying around . The models look really nice . Try it for ten minutes .	1
When it comes to fighting games I spend most of my time playing with the Street Fighter or Dead or Alive crew , but at times I do get fighting time with the Smash Bros. crew . The fighting mechanics are still awesome and function well , the environments are still cool , the destruciton of your enemies or a friend is still loads of fun . Although this game has likely been forgotten since the launch of its Gamecube sequel , it 's still a classic that should not be forgotten by any fighting fan . There 's still fun stuff to unlock , like new characters . The only complaint I have against this game is the fact that it feels too easy at times . Still it never gets old to kick the crap out of Jigglypuff and send her flying or Pikachu .	1
Most N64 games are easy to get sick of but this one , the fun lasts forever . It is so fun to play	1
This game is simply amazing , you ca n't disagree , it is so fun , never repetative because everyday I would invite friends over to my house and we would play for hours and hours . The gameplay is great , if your into Melee it is similar but it takes a while getting use to the controls of the Gamecube . I was a master at this game , I loves it so much , a character I recommend that all beginners should use would be Fox , he is the easiest to use , but he is also very good if you can use him right . Jigglypuff and Ness are not for beginners , but Metronome might be the strongest move in the game . This is a fantastic game , unlock characters , set new records for your vs matches because every match you have goes down into the record column . This is a must have for N64 whether you are 10 or 20 ! Remember though , play with friends , not by yourself !	1
This game may be old , but it 's still pretty amazing . You can never go wrong with SSB , so stop reading this and buy the game . Just wish they were n't 50 bucks	1
Very fun to play as your favorite characters . I still like from this game how tight the gameplay is and how each character `` feels '' unique . I think in previous incarnations they have gotten a bit of this back , but this game I truely felt different playing Kirby than I did DK .	1
This is a great personal combat game , especially for children . I much prefer Tekken , but this game is also fun . There is no blood or gore . You chose from characters that star in other Nintendo games , and each has their own powers . My sons ( ages 6 , 8 and 10 ) love this game . Highly recommended for children ( and adults ) !	1
This was one of my first video games i played.Its addeticing , great graphics for a nintendo 64 game , all the charaters have diffrent moves and abilites.Theres all kind of wepons and POKO BALLS ! I have the ps2 , and ps3 , and i still play this game.And do u no why , BECAUSE THIS GAME IS SO FUN !	1
If you see this game around Immediatly purchase it on the spot . this game can provide hours and hours of multiplayer fun . ( 1 player is boring but better than playing multiplayer by lonesome ) there a alot of unlockable characters that are pretty cool here tehy are : Captain Falcon from F-zero series , Ness from the rare Earthbound series , Jigglypuff from pokemon , Luigi from the Mario Bros. series , And if you have a gameshark there are cool codes the allow you to be the boss of the Smash Bros. titles , ( Master Hand ) and you could also be Metal Mario with a Gameshark . cool huh ? have fun and train . This is n't one of those titles you can just rent and enjoy you got ta own it for it to be fun .	1
Supersmash Bros. , is one of the most fun N64 games . It has few problems which include not the best graphics and lack of replay value . You will have an exellent time playing though ( I recomend playing as Donkey Kong ) , overall its hard not to like . A great game check it out .	1
The N64 had its share of ups and downs , but when it hit up , boy does it hit it . This is the ultimate party game . Invite some friends over , order a pizza , and watch the mayhem unfold . The controls and graphics have aged well , with the colors remaining bright and colorful and the moves still being easy to pull off.The one downside is that the single player mode has n't aged as well . Unlocking the four hidden characters is pretty simplistic , though it 's hard to fault a 14ish year old game for that . This is a fantastic buy for anyone who wants to start up their collection of N64 games or for anyone looking for a great party experience	1
Growing up as a Super Smash Brothers fan , I played this game with my brother and sister for hours on end . It is so fun and the gameplay is simple too . Even though this game is older , the graphics are still really really good . In my opinion , this is a must have classic because of its huge impact on the gaming community . Anyone who played this growing up knows how special this game is . And it REALLY is .	1
THIS GAME IS HILARIOUS ! THE DEAL ? YOU PLAY AS STUFFED ANIMALS , SHAPED LIKE NINTENDO STARS , OR I should REALLY say is , & quot ; Beanie Baby & quot ; , and knock the living stuffing out of each other ! With little violence and powerful COMEDY , this game should surplus 5 stars , I 'D GIVE THIS ONE 1,000 STARS AT LEAST AND BY FAR ! This game is meant for fun and not violence ! FUN BEAT-EM-UP GAME PLAY AND TEAM MATCHES MAKES THIS GAME HILARIOUS ! Sadly , I WANTED TO SEE PIT & quot ; KID ICARUS & quot ; IN THIS GAME , MAYBE IN THE THIRD INSTALLMENT OF THIS GAME . SUPPORT ME AND GO TO NINTENDO 'S web site and ask , ask , ask ! PRETTY SOON , THEY 'LL COME WITH THE THIRD GAME AND & quot ; DAI-BIYESSO , DAI-BIYE ! & quot ; ( FIGHT ON ! FIGHT ON ! )	1
I bought a used version of this cartridge after seeing my 3-year old son being hooked with it during a visit to my sister's.You have 8 characters to choose from with 4 additional hidden characters you can release after succeeding in various playing modes at specific difficulty levels . Each character has its own set of special moves , sounds and taunts.The purpose of the game is to use your character skills and moves to knock off your opponent from the hovering playing field . Damage to you or to your opponent builds up as you hit him/her . Some punches or moves give more damage than others and as the damaged builds up , the character turns more vulnerable to being knocked off.There are a few moves that only give damage and other moves are used to specifically knock off your opponent . This means that you can not just push buttons at random , it requires a lot of patience and some reflexes to defeat your adversary consistently.The game is extremely simple to learn , yet there are quite a large amount of special moves to master . You will definitely require all those special moves when playing the most advanced levels or when facing more skilled human opponents.I kind of sticked with Mario when playing , for me it is the most well-rounded character , although I 'm sure that some of the hidden characters are quite versatile as well.I found out that this game can be handicap adjusted , making it fun and fair for all ages and skill levels.This game is definitely more fun in a multi-player scenario , but it is also extremely fun using the computer as an opponent . You can play a free-for-all match ( everyone against everyone ) with up to 3 computer ( or human ) controlled characters , having each one the same or their own unique skill levels . There is also a Team-Battle , where you team up with a computer or a human to face another human/computer team.One small thing I did noticed was some slow control response in some instances , especially when playing the harder levels ; it requires a little patience getting used to it.This game is very easy to learn , extremely addictive , colorful , fun , challenging and funny . It has dozens of playing options and many cool sounds . It is quite entertaining with lots of clean fun for the whole family.5 stars and 100 % recommended .	1
This game is the best . The only thing I did n't like about this game is that the graphics were not the best . If you 're a first time N64 buyer , get this game ! It 's really fun , and pretty competitive . It is even better when you have friends to play with .	1
This has to be one of the best games I have ever played . The whole concept of nintendo characters pounding other nintendo characters into oblivion is interesting , and very fun . The Comical and Chaotic feeling of running around and bashing other players of the field in multyplayer fun . You play as one of twelve characters ; four of which must be unlocked . The basic characters are all easy to play with , and relatively popular . They are as follows : Kirby ( Kirby ) , Mario ( Mario ) , Link ( Zelda ) , Samus Aran ( Super Metroid ) , Donkey Kong ( Donkey Kong ) , Fox McCloud ( Star Fox ) , Pikachu ( Pokemon ) , Yoshi ( Mario ) . Most of these should be familiar to the moderate gamer , with the exception of Samus , a popular GB character with Metroid . There are many items in this game that you can collect to boost progress . You can get a light saber type thing , making an adequate weapon for plasy . You can also get a fire flower ( Mario Bros ) , Pokeball ( Pokemon ) , and ray gun ( star fox ) . You can also get a Star Man , making you invincible , and a hammer , letting you smash other opponents out of the match.The damage and knock out works like this : With each attack landed on an opponent , their damage percentage goes up . The higher the percentage , the farther and faster each player will fly after each hit . Players can fall off the edge of the map , or fly too high and fall into the horizon . In single player mode , you fight computer controlled characters on many different stages . You earn points based on how well you do ( ie how fast you defeat all the enemies ) and what you do ( ie using the same move the whole stage ) . Eventually you can fight the master hand , boss of the last stage . Once you beat him , you have the opportinity to unlock hidden characters , Luigi ( Mario ) , Jigglypuff ( Pokemon ) , Ness ( EarthBound ) , and Captain Falcon ( FZero Racing ) . You also try for the highest score.Multiplayer can be more fun . You basically go through a skirmish against 1 to 3 other players , whether controlled by the computer or a human . The items will apply , and you can turn them on or off by playing 50 multiplayer games and unlocking the item switch . After you end the time limit with more points than all other players / if everyone else is out of lives , you get ranked 1st 2nd 3rd or 4th , and the stats of the game are sent into the game stats bank , which you can look over.You can also practice some of the stages of the game , trying for the best time . If you persist in this , you can unlock luigi . It is always good to get practice.Overall , this game deserves a more than five stars . It is very fun , and it provides endless entertainment .	1
Many well known ( and some not so well known ) classic Nintendo characters fight it out here.Imagine Mario against Link ? IS that possible ? Here it is , you can even throw in a Pikachu ! .The combat system is easy enough and each character has a blend of moves and taunts.Some characters are good for close rang while others are good at middle ground.The levels branch off from the characters own worlds.Like Link would have a castle roof top to fight on.Yoshi would have a little story book zone and so on.Colors can be changed for the outfits so you can tell who 's who if you play as the same character as oneanother.The weapons span out from each of the characters franchises with a Mario fire flower and so on.I ca n't believe how exspensive this is this is truly a must have .	1
All of your favorite classic nintendo characters have joined forces to decide who rules the Nintendo World ? This awesome fighting game is like Mario and Mortal Kombat together . The great thing is that theres no real violence at all ! Mario can perfect his fireball move , Fox McCloud can shoot his laser , Link can throw boomerangs and bombs , while little kirby can suck up players and steal there secret powers . All characters have different special attacks . They can all punch and kick , but they all throw , smash , pound , pummle , blast and burn diffrently . Also , items fall down from the sky that you can use againts your opponents . Pokeballs , ( which actually contain several random pokemon that each do different things ) swords , hammers , Maximum Tomatoes and fire-flowers all rain down so you can reign over everyone on the field . With an awesome multiplayer option , this is a sure Nintendo Classic . Try this game , you 'll fall in love with it fast .	1
I look forward to playing . All the saves work great no trouble at all . The sticker was torn , but I just took it off and printed out a new one .	1
Super Smash Bros. for the Nintendo 64 is one of the best games ever made . It includes 8 characters from different Nintendo games . You can chosoe to play with Mario , Luigi , Link , Ness , Kirby , Samus Jigglypuff and Pikachu . The graphics are great and the animations flow smoothly as you play.There are hidden characters and a large variety of arena 's from many different Nintendo games to battle in . There are several aweosme modes to play in , including Battle mode , training mode and even a bonus mode ! In addition , there are several items you can pick up to fight your opponents an to help restore your health . There are swords , fire flowers , lasers , a magic star wand , red and green shells , tomatoes to restore damage percentage , a super baseball bat and explosive barrels . There are also falling Snorlax 's ( giant Pokemon ) that fall out of the sky and try to land on you.I highly recommend this game to any Nintendo 64 owner . If you own a GameCube look for Super Smash Bros Melee .	1
Super Smash Brothers ... I remember reading in a magazine about this game and thinking , & quot ; Finally a game that 's going to be a smash ! & quot ; . A year or so later when I played it for the first time , my hopes were confirmed . This title is one if the best , if not the best , fighting and party game for the N64 . Not being much of a Mortal Kombat fan , because of the blood and gore , I was happy to finally see a game that was fun , innovating and bloodless . No , no finishing moves in this game . : - ) Super Smash brothers is exactly what the name says , a smash . With 8 available Nintendo stars to choose from at first and 4 hidden away to be unlocked later , this game is a major intrest-getter . Great Nintendo stars are avalaible to fight with such as Pikachu , Link , Kirby , Donkey Kong , etc . and keep the game fun and exciting . There is a hidden level to unlock and secret options to uncover , guaranteeing that you wo n't want to put the game down till you have them all.As a fun factor and replay value this game definitley rates way over a five . The game supports up to 4-players at once , making it a great party game . All you need is some popcorn , a couple of sodas and a few pillows and the night is made . You can play with computer controlled characters and also as teams , up to three diferent teams at once . The one player game is very fun and challenging too . SSB contains no blood or gore making it a great title for anyone . Parents will be happy about that matter because I know how some parents do n't apreciate blood , gore and guts in a game.The gameplay rates very high also.Gameplay is easy to learn , fast and furious . The action keeps you on your toes and you fingers twitching at the controls . The levels and graphics are smooth and cool . Sometimes during a 4-player match the game will go into slow-motion for a couple of seconds . Some gamers see this as a problem but I think sometimes it adds to the effect of the game . Also some elements or weapons are in 2-d making thme seem like paper but this does not detract from the game at all . Some levels are cute , like the Yoshi level and the Kirby one , while others have a sort of seriousness to them , Fox 's and Link are examples . All the levels have some sort of hazard to them like a plane coming and shooting lasers at you or a tree blowing you off the screen , adding to the fun and challenge rate . But no matter what level you play on the graphics a clean , very crisp and the levels are very fun.This title is really great for a bunch of friends or just for yourself and is definitley a game that even parents can learn to play . So that makes it in a way a great way to spend time with your kids too . For the kids , this is a great title for new or experienced gamers . This game is worth every penny of what you spend on it.A party bash , a rainy day , you should n't stall , it 's great for all . : - ) From an owner and gamer , Andrew H. King .	1
If you own the N64 then you must have this game . The graphics are a bit out dated , but who cares ! The game is still great ! Even though there are less characters than the newer smash bros this game still brings in the punches . You can play story/one player mode and also play up to 4 people.In one player mode you can either do the story mode or do the challenges . Both are fun ! You can set up the difficulties and also set up how many lives you can use.Multiplayer mode is also fun . You have the ability to play in teams or not . Still you can set up the difficulties . PLUS , you can have a time battle or set up how many lives you can use.Though unlike mele you ca n't plat story mode with 2 players ... but that should n't be the reason for not getting this game !	1
This game was fantastic when it came out . As a kid nothing made me more excited than seeing all of my Nintendo characters in one game fighting it out . This game shined the most multiplayer where you could play against 3 other people . The only problem with getting this game now is that there are sequels out there that are far superior to this one with even more characters . If your feeling nostalgic , then get this game .	1
This Game is Awsome ... purely ... AWSOME ! ! ! ! I has an OK 1 player made but ... the multiplayer is just outstanding ! ! This is a great party game ... You just ca n't stop playing . Personally , DK , Fox , Kirby are my Favorites ... btw ... if you set the damage in multiplayer to 200 % , then hit players 1-3 times using DK 's ^+B spcieal move , your opponent will FLY ! ! ! AND I MEAN FLY ! ! ! ; ) My Friends hate this move ! ! ! : ) Also Fox 's \/+B Special move , you can reflect all moves and attacks ! ! ! and Kirby can suck players abilities and fall on them with his \/+B special move like a brick ! ! ! You have to buy this game ! ! It is the best ever ! !	1
Ok , I 'm really tired , so this 'll be a short review . Its really great , in adventure you get to fight lots of assorted people , and in vs , you get to pick your character to fight against an opponent . I played it with my brother for about 1000 vs mode matches , and now I 'm bored with it . It lasts , but once you unlock all the secrets , and play vs a lot , it does get boring .	1
This game is excellent . You can fight all of your favorite Nintendo characters together and have a good time . There is no blood , gore or cursing in the game , and that is what separates this game for all other fighting games . ( One reason I do n't buy a lot of fighting games is the blood and gore . ) I think everyone will have a good time except those people that think games are only good when there is blood and gore . ( Read some of the other reviews and you 'll see what I mean . ) There are so many good things about this game that 1000 words is n't enough . I will tell you the cons instead of wasting time and words . CONS : Hard to get secret characters , Not enough Pokemon Characters , More Characters Should Be In It such as : Turok , Princess Peach , Zelda , Wario , Bowser , Diddy Kong , Dixie Kong , Charmander , Mewtwo , Bomberman , Goemon , Yae , Ebisumaru , Sasuke , Impact , James Bond , and others . Better weapons are needed because some of them are lame ( The fan and Shells for example ) Other than that , the game is great , and you definitely should buy it !	1
one if the top 5 nintendo 64 games of all time.just as good as mario 64 to me.it is one of the most popular too	1
The game is ok . When I rented it for 5 days , it got boring at the last day . My brother got Jigglypuff using DK . I would rent it before buying it . If you like it , buy it .	1
Super Smash Bros. is one of the first games I bought for the Nintendo 64 and I was not disappointed.The levels are great although they are limited the characters are all obviously awesome and the gameplay is solid.Although Super Smash Bros Melee is obviously better ( more stages , more characters , more moves , characters easier to unlock , better levels , better graphics , etc ) it is still one of my favorite games.The controls are pretty solid.The CPUs are challenging and its still exciting.I say get this game youll be glad you did.If youre not already a big Smash Bros. fan youll become one .	1
super smash bros is an incredible game . the graphics are nice and simple the controls are great . this game may not be the best n64 game but it 's definitly in the top 10. you can chose all your favorite nintendo characters and they all have unique moves . you start of with 8 characters but when you accomplish certain things you get new characters like luigi and captain falcon . super smash bros appeals to any age ( i 'm 14 and this is one of my favorite games ) .there are a good selection of stages with a lot of variety.The object of the game is not to kill the other person but to knok him of the stage far enouph that he wo n't be able to jump back to the stage.the game has 5 dificulty levels : very easy , easy , normal , hard and very hard . which makes the game more chalenging as you get better.there are also 24 mimi games or bonus stages you can play without having to play a i player game . each character has 2 different bonus stages.the part where the game really eccels is the multi player mode which is so incredibly fun . there is no game that equls super smash brothers as a multiplayer game.overall this is a great game and a must in every n64 game librarie	1
This game is the one my kids play more than any other on their Nintendo . They have other games , they rent other games , but they keep coming back to this one.They like the two player option . They like the challenge ( they 're not teens yet ) . They like the many characters that can be chosen from different games . They like being able to set their and the opponent 's skill levels . They just love this game ! I personally wish it were a little less violent , but compared to other games out there , this is a teaparty . So if you 're a parent looking for a fun game that will give your kids hundreds of hours of play and one they wo n't get tired of , buy this game .	1
while melee is by far my favorite , brawl and the original come close . one has nostalgic value , while one is a good way to continue the series . I love the game whether i am alone or with friends	1
Its awesome the way you fight and if you get enough wins you get NESS-the best character ever ! NESS is from the ultra-rare Super Nintendo game , EarthBound ! ( i actually own both ) While I am writing this i am listening to earthbound music . IT RULES ALL COMBAT GAMES ! NOW CLASH EM ' !	1
This is a great game , one of the best for the system . It 's certainly innovative when it comes to fighting games . There 's no button mashing or crazy combos in this game , just simple B , A and control stick combos . In a way this is good ; its not as complicated , and easy to get started . But it 's also bad ; there 's a limited number of moves.Also , some characters are really useless . Jigglypuff ? One Pokemon was enough , but this is even a crapified version of Kirby . Which takes me to number two . Kirby . I like the character an the developers had teh right idea , but hes too strong . Playing against aKirby gets really cheap ... I 'm sure some of you know what I mean . His brick can protect him from about anything ! There 's only 9 stages ... a few of which are really bad like Kirby 's , and the Pokemon one 's not too great either . But there 's good ones also like Hyrule , Fox , Mario and the Donkey . Then there 's the nostalgic ones.This game is great , especially because of its small learning curve and awesome replay value ( the best next to goldeneye ) . Definitely worth your money .	1
It was more expensive than the used console I bought , but I did n't mind the price just because of how fantastic it is to be able to play this again .	1
SSB is an original fighter that is always fun to play . It has four unlockable characters , one unlockable arena , and some other secerets . The only bad part is it is a little to easy ( even on very hard ) . But this game is addicitive . Short Version : Graphics : 4.4 Sound : 4.2 Control : 4.3 Fun Factor : 4.7 Total : 4.4	1
Enter the fray with your favorite character ( well if , like me , you have two or more favorite characters , you know what to do ... ) and prove to your opponents ( they can be human or CPU ) who rules ! Super Smash Bros for the 64 is one worthful piece that reflects how so far the multiplayer action can go , and so continued on the GameCube and Wii ( I own all three ! ) . With easy gameplay , good BGM , endless multiplayer battle , great feedback when using Rumble pak , some characters info ( obviously not as much as on the GC or Wii ) , tons of fun , and also that this game left the necessary for its successors ; SSB is worthy to own . If you still do n't have this `` jewel '' , hurry up and find it ! You 64 owners should have it ! Consider four good-working controllers and rumble paks.But the only bad thing . As all SSB games , you 'll feel bored after twenty multiplayer battles ( just to say sth ) , well but that 's no problem . The action continues !	1
I remember playing this with my cousin when I was little and while I have played both the others this is still a great game to go back to . This is a must own	1
This one started it all so it is the most popular . It has great graphics for the 64 and the sound is amazing . I loved all of the super smash bros series and to this day these r my favorites for each system . It has a great multiplayer game and the stages r very creative . The only bad thing about the game is that there r only 12 charecters and not that many stages but remember this is the first one . If u look at the front it looks like a kiddie game but thats what all of the nintindo games looked like back then . The graphics r so good that sometimes u cant tell this on and the melle games apart .	1
( my son is going to do this reviwe ) ( I am 12 years old ) my name is Andrew . all I can say is wow . this is the best 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 player game of all you can choose up to 8 people ( and 4 hiden people ) and they are jigglypuff , c.falcon , luigi , and ness . and the people from the start are . Kirby ( my favorite ) Yoshi ( my other favorite ) zelda , samus , mario , DK , pikachu , and fox . it is the best game I own . each person has different powers . but all of them have B attack , up B attack , down B attack , A attack , smash attacks , a block , a throw attack oh and punches and kicks and a bunch of other combos . and all of them are different . well luigi 's and mario 's are sort of a like . and lots of battle arenas . and you can copy some ones B attack if you are kirby . my favorite person to play with is kirby he may be a little cute pink cuddly puff ball ( ... ) oh and I like yoshi at first I hated yoshi but then I used him and he was prety darn good . my little brother likes samus . I like every body but my favorites are yoshi and Kirby . and if you think this looks like a little kid game you are wrong . it is packed with punches and kicks . oh and I want a game cube because they have super smash brothers melee but it is to much $ $ $ . oh and super smash bros melee has a bunch of new people to choose and different battle arenas and a lot better graphics . and lots of new stuff . so you had better buy this game . it is the best game vever ! . it is one big smash ! trust me you are going to like it . so get out there and buy this super awsom ( ... ) game . it rocks ! ! !	1
Okay there is only one bad thing about this game . So now there is meele and 25 characters ! but there is only 12 in the other . I am best with Captin Falcon . I am worst at Pikachu . Please Please Please do not laugh at my reiview . I am only 9 !	1
A very exciting and fun fighting game ; Super Smash Bros. is definentally worthy of my approval . In this great multiplayer game you fight opponents using awesome moves and killer items . There are also a variety of levels , each containing their own special dangers . The object of the game is to knock your opponent off the edge of the thing you are fighting on . It could range from a spaceship in the star-e-ness of space to the tops of skyscrapers ! Each fighter has their own special moves and abilities to crush other fighters with . Their moves are not hard to learn , so you can get pretty good at the game in a relitively short time.Also , Super Smash Bros. does n't get boring after you beat it . I 've had the game for about three , four years and I still love it . And if you get this AWESOME multiplayer combat game hopefully you will too .	1
Super Smash Brothers was one of the last installments to the now dead N64 gaming line . A perfect ending , if you ask me . This is't your average Mortal Kombat or Tekken game . You do n't have limited health , you are n't crammed up in a tiny little space , and the computer player dose n't always win . You can run around on vast terrains , where items such as light sabers ( Samus Aron or Star Fox , I do n't know ) , pokeballs ( Pokemon ) , hammers ( The original Donkey Kong arcade ) , and lasers ( Star Fox ) fall from the sky , and are at whoever grabs them first 's disposal . The levels are : Mario Brother 's flying island thingie , Zelda 's castle , Saffaron City , Star Fox 's ship , Samus Aaron 's near-destructed planet , Donkey Kong 's jungle , Yosie 's island , and Kirby 's planet . There 's also a hidden level , The Mario Brother 's classic arcade world . And , now , the players : Mario , Yoshi , Kirby , Star Fox , Samus Aron , Donkey Kong , Link , and ... Pikachu . And , there a 4 bonus characters , and I 'll tell ya how to get them : Jigglypuff-All you have to do is beat the game , on any mode , no matter how many lives you lose.Captain Falcon-Beat the whole game on any challenge level in under 20 minutes.Ness-Beat the game on normal with only 3 lives , without getting any game overs.Luigi-Go to pratice and beat everyone 's ( except the bonus character 's ) bonus game 1 . Luigi is faster and stronger than Mario.HAVE FUN ! !	1
I convinced my cousin to rent this game back when it first came out because we were crazy about pokemon and I loved the commercial for it.When we first played it , it was hard . The controls were hard and there were too many moves to remember . But once you get around the learning curve , which only took a day or 2 , the game is a great ride.The thing about the game is that it has everybody 's favorite Nintendo characters in one game . It does n't even skip on the moves . You can throw Link 's boomerang , Samus Aran 's morphing ball bombs , Mario 's fireballs , Jigglypuff 's sing , and many other characters moves . The graphics for the game were excellent at the time and still look better than any N64 game except Mario 64.Not only do you have every characters special moves is that almost everybody has their own level and music from their game . You can fight on a Pokemon Center , the Great Fox , Brinstar Depths , or in Dreamland to name a few levels . The only characters that do n't have their own level or share one with another character are Ness , Captain Falcon , Jigglypuff , and Luigi . It also has weapons from each characters game . The Bo-ombs , Ray Guns , Poke Balls , Hammers , and others . If you do n't like items then you can turn them off which is another cool feature.Another thing about the game is that you have to unlock half of it . You have to beat the game with everyone which makes you appreciate each character 's strength and weaknesses . Yoshi does n't have a triple jump so you have to play to that weakness while Kirby has about 7 jumps which a strength . You have to learn to take advantage of your enemies weaknesses . If you see Samus charging up be ready to reflect it back with Fox.The best thing about this game is that you have to unlock half the things yourself . You have to unlock characters and levels . It is fun , especially since the single-player is great fun.What do you do after you unlock everything ? Play multiplayer mode of course which is the best part of the game . You and up to 3 friends or AI duke it out in a free-for-all . Do n't like playing by yourself , you can set it to teams with up to 3 teams ( red , green , or blue ) and fight that way . You can play by lives or by a time limit . You 'll never get tired of this game and be popping it in every so often for years to come .	1
If you 're into pretty colors and flashy graphics , and care much less about actually having controller inputs match character actions , go ahead and get SSB : Melee instead . It 's got a general `` random '' feel to it and skill is n't as important as luck and drooling mindlessly over the images on the screen.However , if you prefer to buy a fighting game because ... it 's a fighting game , and not pathetic eye-candy , the original SSB is godly . The controls are extremely precise , and it 's possible to execute combos to near perfection . Indeed , combos are key to this game , something most players seem not to understand . Melee seems to have been created to eliminate combos and reduce fighting to random hacking and button-mashing ; this is perfectly suited to mentally deficient monkeys , but humans with brains might prefer something that takes a little bit of skill . The only problem with SSB is that the combos can become degenerate , and certain characters are simply not viable , but most players do n't seem good enough to take advantage of this ( almost no one thinks Jigglypuff is anything more than a pathetic waste of a spot , for instance ) so enjoy !	1
Only the best fighting game ever , provides hours of fun for you and you friends . Pick your favorite Nintendo character and start smashin ' !	1
This was one of my most anticpated games of all time for the N64 and this game really lives up to the hype I had . This is one of the finest piece of fighting game I 've played on the N64 . It 's even more cool how all of the best Nintendo trademark characters battle it out such as Samus , Mario , Link , Fox , DK , CAPTAIN FALCON AND MORE ! This game had some really impressive graphics on the N64 and once again shocked me at how incredible the graphics for N64 are . The action is fast pace and never looses its touch and cause me to play hours and hours of none stop story mode AND just plain fighting it out with friends or bots . The game is incredible and should be played by all Nintendo Fans . I found this to be far superior then most fighting games But SSBM was better then this but hey this one is a classic ! It features some awesome Levels and great Handicapped matches . It 's cool how you can also set up any match you . You can also try to beat time records in story mode so you can get New secret characters like Captain Falcon . The game was very impressive and this is why I gave it the score it got . Classic ... Graphics ... man the graphics are just amazing ! Really great visuals almost all the games I review I give the visuals Good reviews but hey I ca n't help it ? ... ok ! ! ! Man the graphics for the characters are so cool . I loved the character desighn for Samus especially . Fox and Mario looked awesome too . It ranks up with the other great N64 titles like Zelda . This is truly not to be missed.Gameplay is fun filled fighting action . None stop action and fast paces moves make this an action packed thrill ride of none stop ass kicking and you 'll do even better if you get Kirby who is the best . No matter how bad you think the game is you have to admit the gameplay is Action packed and is nothing but nonstop fun ! The gameplay in this game is just worth getting the game . Ewww Samus never looked so good ... blah ! The sound is cutting edge punches , shooting and well ... fighting..eheheh You can here Yoshi flying in the air from miles away and it is so detailed I think Nintendo Worked very hard on this Title . The sound is above average , I know it 's lame that I review sound but oh well who cares ... .Well Like I said the sound is above average and is very very very detailed . Earns a star ... ... well ... ... .From Impressive Visuals to great nonstop action filled fun with some really great Nintendo characters like Samus and Mario to very detailed sound . And lets not forget about the pretty intence story mode which you can beat time records to unlock hidden characters . This game will take hours hell probably months till you get bored of this Title but I still play it once and awhile but over all with that said ... this impressive title truly earns its..5 out of 5 stars ... .Like I said ... very impressive game ... Lates	1
I do n't care if you are 4 years old or 40 years old , put this game on and pick up a controller and you 'll be playing for hours . I bought this copy for my cousin , who recently replaced the system that his parents sold years ago . He could n't have been happier . I still like this one better than the Gamecube and Wii versions , because its simpler .	1
Super Smash Bros ... ... before it , there were fighting games like Street Fighter , Mortal Kombat , and Virtua Fighter . Their rules were a bit similar , and every fighting game was like that ... ... .until Smash Bros came along ! Super Smash Bros reinvented the rules of fighting games , combining platforming with fighting moves , such as punching , kicking , etc . What 's even more of a no-brainer is how several Nintendo franchises crossed over to star in this one game . Each character has their own abilities , such as Mario throwing fireballs , and Fox using his laser gun.There are a variety of stages to choose from , and most of them have their own gimmicks . The Mushroom Kingdom ( unlcokable ) has pipes you can go into , and Pokemon Stadium lets you open a door that certain Pokemon pop out of and attack.The 1-Player Mode is a series of battles , like how fighting games usually are . Unfortunately , the rosters of the battles do n't change.However , overall , you 'll get a huge kick out of this game , especially when it comes to playing multiplayer . 4 players duking it out ... what more can you ask for ? Well , besides Brawl and Melee .	1
My brother and I rented this game numerous times and in the end finally decided to buy it . It is actually quite fun to play , with many arenas and many of the famous characters from Nintendo . Each character basically has their own arena , and all of the arenas have their advantages and disadvantages . This game is especially recommended as a gift for a child.What I love about this game is that you can play with as many computers as you want , and they can be against you , or if you want to have fun they can be on your team . You can have timed battles or die from losing lives.Pros:1 ) Fun multiplayer action2 ) Computer feature is great -- -you can set computers skill level3 ) Good training level , where you can control many things , and add items and make the computer do things to help you train4 ) Just Great ! ! Cons:1 ) Certain characters are hard to get ( like Ness ) 2 ) Less advanced than Super Smash Bros Melee3 ) Controls are sometimes difficultThis is a great gift for anyone who is young ( especially ) and for anyone with a N64 .	1
Wow ! This game is so cool ! A fighting game with 12 great nintendo characters ! They are ... Starfox ( my fave ) , Mario , Donkey Kong , Yoshi , Samus , Pikachu , Kirby , and Link . And do n't forget the 4 other characters that you have to unlock ! They are Jigglypuff , Luigi , Captain Falcon , and Ness . With Fighting games , you usually think that there is going to be blood and gore and stuff , but that 's not the case here.This game can be played by all ages.It basically just has cartoon violence in it , nothing major.The characters have different attacks and can use all sorts of items . It has great replay value and can be played with up to 4 people.While it may take a while to master , this game is great and is reccomended to anyone . Also if you liked this , then you 'll really like Super Smash Bros. Melee for GCN . Trust me .	1
I had this game when I was a little kid so I already knew it was awesome . I love it	1
What can I say ? Smash Bros. is just an awesome game . This is the only game you can get where all of your favorite Nintendo characters come together on one screen and battle it out . I recommend calling over 3 more of your buddies and playing it because this game is nuts when 4 players go head to head.Overall I give Mario Smash Bros. 4 stars . I took off a star because after you obtain the 4 missing characters , the game is basically over . You can still battle with your friends , but like most games , it starts to get old after a while . I recommend it for ages 5 - 15 .	1
I had recently bought this game a month back and I enjoyed it on my N64.Later after deleting the earlier data I played through the game and unlocked jiggly puff . The next time I tried it was captain falcon . After that it was no one because I made a mistake . Later I went online to this link and it helped me get everything . It 's very true info . There 's even a new level ( Mushroom Kingdom Classic . ) I hope it helps you : ) [ EDIT ] Here I was nice enough to post everything for you : Cheat : 999 % There are two ways to to do this , you must pick Mario as your character and you must go to Hyrule Castle as a stage ( you can fight any opponent you want ) . At Hyrule Castle , get your chosen opponent to the top wooden platform , and then push him or her off of the platform on the left side . Then , spawn as many green shells as you can on the right side of the platform . From here , go to the middle platform and go to the edge of the left side , facing left . Do Mario 's Up + B move - if done correctly , your opponent 's percentage will go up to 999 % . Then , simply wait a second , and knock your opponent off the screen . The other way that takes longer , but is easier . Just select any chracter that shoots projectiles , like mario , luigi , and fox then keep hurting your opponent at the practice level of any selection until they get 999 % and after hit the opponent and see them fly like a missle.Unlockable : Mushroom KingdomTo unlock the Mushroom Kingdom beat the game with all eight original characters . This will open up a level that resembles an old-school Super Mario Bros. level.Change Outfits : You can change your character 's outfits by tapping the four C Buttons at the character select screen . Some costume changes are limited to colors , but characters like Pikachu are also available with a hat.Unlockable Luigi : To play as Luigi , pass the Bonus Practice 1 with at least 8 main characters like the ones you did n't have to unlock . When Luigi challenges you , defeat him and he 's yours.Kirby 's Power Loss : Everybody knows that Kirby can swallow his opponents and take on some of their powers in this game , but what if you accidentally `` ate '' a character you did n't want -- and you want to pursue someone else ? Simple : Just press the L Button to pull of Kirby 's `` Hello ! '' taunt and he will discard whatever power he took on.JigglypuffIf you want to get the Pokemon Jigglypuff all you have to do is beat the game one time and then you will face JigglyPuff in a battle . If you beat JigglyPuff you will be able to use her in the game.Unlockable : Item Switch MenuTo unlock the Item menu ( where players determine weapons and their frequency ) , play Vs. mode at least 50 times.Unlockable : Captain FalconTo play as Captain Falcon , you must beat the game on any difficulty with however many lives in UNDER 20 MINUTES . After that Captain Falcon will challenge you . Once you beat him , you be able to select Captain Falcon as a character.Unlockakle : NessTo play as Ness , beat the one-player mode with any character , with the number of starting lives set to 3 and the difficulty set to NORMAL . You must beat the game without continuing.Unlockable : Sound TestTo activate the Sound Test , successfully complete Bonus Practice games 1 and 2 with all characters & iquest ; including the hidden ones . The Test Music option will appear on the Data screen.Quick Recovery : Have you ever been hit so far you have n't been able to get back into the game to help your buddies ? After being hit into the air , tap Z as soon as you hit the ground . When you hit the ground , you will spring up from the ground quickly , and you can be back in the game faster . Also , you can press forward or backward to roll after you have sprung back into play.Rotate Characters : You can rotate and view the characters from different angles by entering the character bio section and holding Z . You can use the analog stick to move them around .	1
This game is truely the best N64 game ever made . If you want to puarchase it , do n't be afraid of the corny cartoony looks on the front of the box . The game is almost as detailed as Super Smash Bros Melee . If you ca n't afford Super Smash Bros Melee and have a good N64 rusting in your garage , now is the time to buy this . I got mine used , but in very-good condition . There are 8 characters in the game , Samus Aran , Kirby , Mario , DK , Pikachu , Fox Mccould , Yoshi and Link . There are an extra 4 unlockable characters , making the grand total 12 ! The game also features many items from different nintendo brands . Baseball bat from Ness 's world . Ray gun from Star Fox 's area . Invinciablity star from Kirby 's dreamworld . Fire flower from Mario land , and many others ! Even features the orignal hammer ! ! There is only one thing bad about the game ... ... . It only has 8 sceens to battle in ! They are Sector Z , Peaches Castle , Dreamland , Planet Zebes , Yoshi 's Island , Hyrule Temple , Congo Jungle and Safforon City . The sceens are't that bad though . You even get the choice : RANDOM . Another good thing is that up to 4 players can play ! ! ! Or , if you do n't have any bros of sisters , you can fight up to three computer players ! ! You can also change the CP 's level from easy , to medium to hard ! The controls are easy to learn and fun to use ! It also contains `` 1 Player `` Adventure Mode '' ! '' This game is truely the best ! ! You will never get tired of it ! ! ( I 've had it for 4 days now , and I 've been playing it night and day ! ! ) One of the last features of it is that it has `` Break the Targets '' and the new to SSBM and SSBB `` Board the Platforms '' ! ! ! You can even change your characters color if you want ! Here are the character '' s ratings : Mario -- -He 's ok if you like simple gameplay. -- -B button=fireball.Kirby -- -He 's kinda like an ultimate character because of his swallow power. -- -B button=swallow.Samus Aran -- -She 's the best are doging .

The game works perfectly and there has n't been and problems with it so far , and overall it 's a really fun game , one of the best Nintendo 64 games in my opinion .	1
The game that started the Smash franchise.If you still own/play on an N64 , this game is a must have.Endless hours of smashing your friends , this game never gets old !	1
SSB is a game where you take all the classic Nintendo characters and battle them out in arenas . And this is an AWESOME fighting game . This game is very addictive and fun . The one player mode is easy and good for little kids . I really recommend this game .	1
a great game for 2 or more players . when i first played this game , it was really fun an challenging . after a while though it gets boring . if you play it alot it gets too easy and its not as fun anymore . if your going to play it you really need at least 2 players	1
Super Smash Brothers is one of the most unique ideas to hit the gaming world since first person shooters featured deathmatch . For this game it features numerouse memorable nintendo characters such as Link , MArio , Pikachu , Samus Arron , Fox Mcloud and more in basically a battle royal . The real fun is wehn you gather a group of friends and go into battle . The action is almost always intense . However I do have a few complaints about the game.1 : Character Diversity . On the primary roster Three of the 8 basic characters come from one form or another of the mario universe ( Donkey Kong , Yoshi , MArio ) and then Luigi as a hidden characeter . So basically after all the hidden charactres are unlocked ( a royal pain in the *** ) one thrid of the roster comes from the mario universe.2 : Story Mode : Basically in story mode you go through variouse fights , one on one , an army of characters , tag team , handicap , so on until you face the master hand and in the end it turns out your character is just a ( What you thought I was going to spoil the ending ) .So overall this game is great if you have a bunch of friends over , however I would rather own the Gamecube version and that basically this is a rental for a weekend party .	1
A Nintendo64 classic and one of the greatest games ever ! PROS : - Arrived quickly , reliable seller.- Really fun game to play considering the characters , fights and `` story '' .- Perfect mix of epic game characters in one game.CONS : - noneThis is one of the greatest games of all time , I highly recommend it for anyone who has an N64 . `` Break the Targets '' and `` Board the Platforms '' can be pretty tough with characters like NesDo n't have an N64 ? Then buy one to play this game ! FINAL RATING : 5/5	1
Have you ever wondered who would win in a fight , Mario or Jigglypuff ? If Link went up to face Donkey Kong , would he stand a chance ? In Super Smash Bros. , the creators of the game take all of your favorite , well known Nintendo characters and throw them into one game . You can choose from several characters like Mario , Luigi , Pikachu , Link , Kirby and many more to battle against each other until there is only one left standing.It 's a great game to play with your friends and see who is the best Super Smash Bros. player there is . Whether your favorite player to choose from is Samus Aran or Fox McCloud , each player has his or her own special abilities that can help you and your character win the fight.There are many pros to this game that include the vast amount of entertainment it provides with exciting items that appear randomly during battle to keep players interested . You can find poke balls to throw at other opponents , or swords and bats you can use to hit other people . It 's a really fun game to play with people your own age , and its what I think to be one of the more entertaining games on the Nintendo 64.The only cons I can really say about this game are that the creators did n't include enough of our beloved Nintendo characters . Even though they had most of them , I would have enjoyed seeing just a few more of my favorite Nintendo characters battle to the death ! Overall I rate this game a 5 out of 5 for its creativity , entertainment , good use of graphics , and the sound quality .	1
This is a great game to buy for people who have been using Nintendo for years and those who are new to the license . Smash Brothers is a fighting game where nintendo characters ( Mario , Yoshi , Starfox , Pikachu , Samus , Kirby and more duke it out . There are four hidden characters , a few hidden features , and a hidden arena to be unlocked after a ton of gameplay . The sound is good and the graphics are good also . A fun game to both play and watch	1
This is the best fighting game I 've ever played and best for multiple players . There are 8 regular characters plus 4 secret ones , each with over a dozen different moves . There are 8 regular battle arenas ( themed after the 8 characters ) and 1 secret one . Starting with three basic moves and playing with another novice , you can master all of the characters and all of their moves . This game is unfortunately rigidly divided by skill , and good players will consistently beat worse ones . I recommend this for everyone , especially those who enjoy games that require quick descisions .	1
The best game for N64 . Super Smash Bros. is the best fighting game for four friends . Ca n't go wrong with this one !	1
When racing games were dominated by 'real ' simulation Gran Turismo , I just could n't enjoy first two Gran Turismo games except the fact that I do get to drive my car . That chemistry was n't just there . When I picked up this gem , I was immediately sucked into it . The graphic was BETTER than first two Gran Turismo games and not to mention its story line . It 's simple story , but they have managed to present the 'simple ' story with special cutscenes with jazzy music , and believe me , this combination really adds alot to this game.This game does offer variety with two types of racing and four racing team . Not only each team offers various difficulty , but also it offers different storylines . I have especially enjoyed night setting race course , with music which it brings out the essence of each course to its max . May be something 's wrong with me for I just could n't enjoy 'awesome ' Gran Turismo games ( third installment was very enjoyable ) ..you might say.. but this game was MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE than Gran Turismo , Do n't miss it !	1
Graphics : 8/10 - Ridge Racer Type 4 is plausible in this area . The car designs are fantastic and the roads are clear and well-crafted.Sound : 9/10 - Fantastic ! Not too much of this comes from the cars themselves , but the groovy soundtrack , great commentator and crashing sounds give this baby a boost ! Value : 7/10 - A fun car racing game that lasts a long time and challenges you to do better . But in this genre , we have seen games done better and you might want to go off and play them instead.Overall : 8/10 - What can I say ? I thought this was a blast . It was fun , energetic and speedy . A good instalment to the Ridge Racer series . The cars were brilliant and the Great Gran Prix is the best part . However , Ridge Racer Type 4 loses points because it is simply too much like Gran Turismo and you might tire of its same-old routine . Still lots of fun and recommended !	1
And I say true Ridge Racer because I actually like Rage Racer slightly better than this . R4 is the first RR game to have analog support , but what really makes this game is the excellent track design . Unlike Rage Racer and Gran Turismo , you do n't earn money to upgrade your cars , you just unlock cars . That 's its only flaw in my book.Those who are complaining about the quality of the graphics ... drive faster .	1
I purchased this game n summer 2000 and everyone n my family was awestruck by the game 's intro video music , n-game music and graphics ! The only flaw this game has lies n it 's 2-player mode which has horrible draw back ( ca n't barely make out the vehicles both players r using ) !	1
I have several racing games , including the best of all racers , those on Dreamcast ( F355 , Test Drive : Le Mans , and Sega Rally 2 ) . I also have the & quot ; licenses-galore & quot ; Gran Turismo 2 on PSX and Sega GT . Simply put , I have much more fun playing R4 than the & quot ; licenses-galore & quot ; simulation racers , and place R4 on the replayability level of Sega Rally 2 ( my favorite of all ) .R4 is an arcade racer , so people who prefer sim games ( or who & gt ; & gt ; think & lt ; & lt ; they do ) may not like it . However , as a car nut myself with all these racing games , sometimes having less realism and more fantastic cars is the best gaming medicine . R4 has much variety , creative fantasy cars , and an actual personality ( its refreshing to drive a jet-powered racer ; or how 'bout that winnable 1-speed 191-mph 3-ft econocar ! ) .R4 offers a story for each of four different race managers you can work with . Like the different storylines in a Street Fighter game , this adds a dose of personality , though you wo n't mistake these stories for award-winning novellas.R4 is highly recommended to all . It can be & quot ; won & quot ; by those with lesser skill on the & quot ; easier & quot ; teams , but even seasoned racers such as myself get a challenge from at least 1 out of the 4 teams ( the expert-level DRC-team Grand Prix ) . Also , note that one can finish a Grand Prix with a few 3rd or 2nd place finishes , but those who do this and think & quot ; I 'm done & quot ; will never see the better cars in the game . And definitely not the Pac-Man car ... Buy and enjoy !	1
I bought this color , Teal , because I liked teal very much . Other than that , this console has improved on its graphics ! On games like Super Mario Bros. Deluxe and Pokemon Gold and Silver , the graphics are much better ! Also , there is a ample amount of color that your eyes can feast on . Now if you have game boy Pocket and Regular game boy and you 're playing Pokemon [ It does n't matter which one ] , you will notice that when you walk around in Pocket , It 's very blurry . Well this fault has ben fixed in GameBoy Color . It 's extremely helpful because it enables you to see more detail and little things that you could n't see before . I also have some regular gameboy games that are n't for game boy color and if you play them on GameBoy color , they show little color , but no blurryness . Now make sure you read what the box says when you are buying a gameboy color game . There are two types , there is one that says FOR GAMEBOY COLOR ONLY , which you ca n't use on the other gameboys . The second type just says that it 's for gameboy color . Those you can play on the regular gameboys . It wo n't show any color but at least you can play it . There are a couple faults for the gameboy color . One of which is that the console is too small [ for me I have big fingers so it 's hard for a grown up kid ] . A second fault is that the batterys run out faster than the Original GameBoy [ The gameboy pocket battery use is outrageous ! I played the gameboy pocket for 2 hours straight and the batterys were already starting to run out [ [ I think it 's because the console takes AAA 's and they tend to run out fast ] ] . ] . The original gameboy lasted me up to 23 hours ! This only lastes me for about 12 . Well I can see why because of all the good color and good graphics . So my point is that this color gameboy , teal , is a good color to get [ if you like it ] . The console is worth the money too . It all combines . The color , graphics , games , to make a great system !	1
Nintendo has mastered the art of portable gaming , and they have always come out with a better and more advanced Game Boy.Right now the Game Boy Advanced , Game Boy Advanced SP , and Game Boy DS has come out already , so you 're probably wondering why should I get an old Game Boy Color ? Well , a Game Boy Color is still an excellent product , and there are tons of games to choose from . Compared to the original Game Boy or the smaller version of the Game Boy ( was it Game Boy light ? ) this one is great.I really like how this Game Boy Color runs for about 8 hours just off of two double-A batteries . If you want recommendations of Game Boy Games , look no further than the classics-Zelda ( Oracle of Time and Ages ) , Super Mario , and Metroid . Another really cool game is Pokemon , and if you 're not into it then you can find many other great varieties.This Game Boy Color is really reliable and stable . If you do n't do anything really careless with it ( like drop it in the toilet or hit it with a hammer , etc ) it should last you many years . There are many different accessories you can get to enhance your gaming experience also.Game Boy Color is excellent , and if you have n't experienced it yet , then you should go and try it .	1
I never had the chance to own a game boy when they first came out . So I bought one that was used , and I am definitely glad that I did . It works fine and looks awesome . I sometimes take it out and play it just to turn heads . It 's caused many people to exclaim & # 34 ; DUDE IS THAT A GAME BOY ? ! & # 34 ; I 'm often engaged in discussion with people who share their own personal game boy memories and experiences . So much fun .	1
this isnt bad i have it and it works great i think this is better then alot of older systems like game boy or super nt but still its a good system .	1
I love my Game Boy . It is awesome . I recomend to get Super Mario Bros. DX . and a battery pack ( so you wo n't have to waste money on batteries . ) with it .	1
Must I say more	1
I liked this thing . It played in color , but used up batteries fast . The sound is n't all that great ( too quiet ) , and the screen scratches easily .	1
It 's the classic GBC for old school hand held gaming ! It 's not the latest and greatest , but there are plenty of games on here worth playing .	1
the system would be a bit better if it had a front lit screen.but it is still awesome.if you are going to get a game for this system i thing you should get zelda and pokemon silver or pokemon gold.thanks for reading	1
This is the origanal Gameboy Color its not some crappy SP this was amazing due to all the colors on the screen and the size was better than a gamegear for sure . Most of the titles are great and take full advantage of the colors many people say that it 's not that great only because there is no backlight , but who cares anyone remember the Gameboy Light ? And how did that turn out , horrible nintendo did mot want to take another risk like that and they were right backlights and graphics do n't make a game console*cough gamegear cough* its the games for the console and these games are awesome so if you want dust off your old library of Gameboy color games go for it youll be sorry if you do n't	1
Some consoles like Dreamcast and N64 are really good , but hard to carry around . Ether in teh house or ont eh read this console rules ! I would like it to maby be a bit smaller like the pockets , but other wise its really cool . Some of the games you play on the computer , well like Tomb Raider are good , but the controls are so confusing ! But on the GBC 's versiond of the game is really easier to controol and still has all that good stuff . Its a really good console . And the Atomic Purple is the one i have and its really cool . So BUY THIS ITEM ! ! ! Its really good .	1
This is the best present I 've ever gotten . I think it looks so cool now that you can see the games in color instead of black and white , it 's also great that the game boy fits into your pocket so you can take it everywhere with you . I recommend this product to anyone who wants to play video games everywhere , not just in your house .	1
I got my Game Boy Color for Chrsitmas last eyar along with several games . This is by afr the best handheld system availible price-wise . The system is ... cheaper than teh new Game BOy Advance if you buy it used and the games are ... cheaper as well . The graphics may not be top notch , but do n't let that fool you . There many great games including the traditional Nintendo games like Donkey Kong Country and Mario games , sports games liek Madden , All-Star Baseball and Ronaldo Soccer . There is a huge library of games with hudnreds availible . ... This is way better than the bulky Game Boy and much lighter and smaller . THe only problem with it is the buttons are to close and too small which causes a problem for people with big hands like me.MUST HAVE GAMES : Harry Potetr and the Soceror 's StoneAll-Star Baseball 2001Donkey Kong CountryDriverPokemon ( hey , pokemon is gay , but the game sure is fun ) Zelda	1
have some old gameboy color games around ? only have an original gameboyor super gameboythis is great for old games , and is duruable , afordable , and lasts a long time on batteries , but if you like gba games too the gameboy advance sp is for you , plus is has a backlight . these last a long time , and sell for about $ 14.99 on adverage .	1
Great for anybody . The size of the body makes it good for big and small hands . Would recommend to new and vets to gaming .	1
love my Gameboy color .	1
I used to have a Game Boy Color back in elementary school but had since sold it . I recently came into possession of Pokemon Blue Version and needed an old handheld to play it on . There really is no comparison to be drawn between handhelds of the 90s and handhelds of today . 90s wins every time .	1
On this GBC you can play any GBC game you want which would be a good thing do n't you think ? Also if you interested in in what goes on inside The Game Color then make sure you get the Atomic Purple GBC ! ! !	1
I would say the gameboy color was the best hand held game system I ever owned or play . Something that you grew up using will stick to you forever . I still play my gameboy evey now and then , playing games that never get old like pokemon . The only thing I ever had bad to say about the gameboy color was that it does not have a back light and I have to use a worm light . If you ever owned a gameboy in your life it 's something that you always keep with you or end up buying another one like me .	1
Okay if you asked me now I 'd say go with Gameboy advanced . However , the price is right on Gameboy color , and it is still certainly still one of the best handheld systems . I had a lot of fun with the Poke'mon games , and also talking to gameboy for several hours a day . He 'll make a fine companion to anyone living alone in the cold depths of endless solitude . 5 stars definately .	1
it takes me back when i was a kid i used to play pokemon all day i like the color of the gameboy color it rocks	1
Ok , I 'll admit it , I have a Gameboy of my own . 40-something mother of two , and I got one for myself so that I could play with my kids . They 're great ! We are all great Pokemon fans , which is how we got sucked into the whole Gameboy thing , and those are still our favorite games.The only drawback that I find with the thing is that it does need to be well-illuminated , otherwise you 'll give yourself a migrane trying to see the tiny screen . But that aside , these babies are fun ! My kids love them , I love mine , great fun all around . Go for it !	1
Iam a 14 year old female gamer . I have had one of these for about 1 year and a half and absolutely love it ! In the summer of 2000 , I bought Pokemon Stadium for N64 because I had just taken an interest . I did not know you needed the gameboy games ( pretty stupid of me , eh ? ) . So we bought me a kiwi colored gameboy color ( too bad they had no berry color , but kiwi is just as pretty ! ) . Along with it , I gotmy first game , Pokemon Yellow . And boy was it more than I expected . I played it hours on end ! I could not put it down ! I took it everywhere , in the car , resterants , grandparents ' , etc etc etc . It really spiced upmy summer . I kept on sticking to Pokemon games but soon I discovered more great games such as Zelda and Harvest Moon plus tins of others . I even think I enjoy it more than any other console I own ( me and my brother practicly own all the systems ( gamecube , PS2 , dreamcast , n64 , etc , etc ) . The batteries last a good 20 hours or so too , which is great for traveling . Yes , the gameboy advance may be out there too , and i bought one of those , but I almost think that I enjoy this more . I think gameboy color games seem to be more addicting and there are a lot more out at the present.I think the gameboy color is cooler looking than the GBA ! Another great feature is that you can plug headphones in so you can play with sound without disturbing other people . I have recently broke my poor kiwi gameboy by accidently dropping it on the floor.Well , I guess we must get another one . Just make sure not to drop it because the LCD screen can get messed up . i would recommend this to anybody wholoves video game and for ANY age ! This will be fun for yers to come ! !	1
If you want to have fun on the go , you have to get Game Boy color ! ! I had the old gray one before this and this is a MAJOR improvement . The colors add alot of life to the games and its backwards compatible , so you can play all the old games . The size is really convienient and the dandelion color is the best . Buy this system and pick up Game Boy camera with it too ! ! !	1
I got this game system for Christmas , and it is awesome ! The graphics , really depending on the game , though , are great , and the colors go well together , not clashing on screen or distracting you from hours of entertainment . A tip , though , to get the best color and graphics on screen , tilt the Game Boy clockwise or counter-clockwise . I recommend you buy it , it is leaps and bounds ahead of the traditional Game Boy , and the same size as the Game Boy Pocket .	1
Owned my first Nintendo Gameboy Color back in 1999 and loved it so much ! I passed it on to a nephew and it still worked as of the last time I checked on him in 2010 . I miss the Gameboy so much ! On a flight back from Celebration VI in Orlando a spotted one of these being played by a couple in the next seat forward and knew I had to get my hands on another one ! Luckily , found a great price for one in great condition here on Amazon . Next task is to restock on some GBC games at the next Con I attend . I 'm happy to have a Gameboy again !	1
Game Boy Color is absolutely a must-have if you want a portable video game console ! It is great . The things I like about it are that there are many different types of games like action , sports , racing , puzzle , adventure , and more ! I also like the graphics when you are playing the games , even though the screen is very small , you still get a lot of detail . And I like the fact that the screen is in color . There is even a jack where you can plug in a little light so if you are playing in the dark , you can see what you are doing . Some of the best games on Game Boy Color are Monopoly , Ken Griffey Jr. 's Slugfest , All Star Baseball 2000 , Pokemon Pinball and Tetris DX . I also like the fact that there is a very wide selection of games to choose from , which makes for more variety . Overall , if you want a good portable video game console , Game Boy Color is the one to beat ! Thank you for reading my review . I hope it helped .	1
Although the Game Boy Advance is on the way , the original Game Boy ( here in 'Colour ' form ) is still going strong , and is still the only mainstream hand-held console.Compared with the sadly-missed Neo Geo Pocket the screen is slightly less vibrant , and sorely needs a backlight ( although adding one would decimate the battery life ) . Technically , although the NGP was 16-bit , there does n't seem to be much difference , and in any case it 's the quality of the games that 's important . This is the Game Boy 's strength - it has an enormous , ever-growing range of games , some of which is excellent ( the third 'Wario ' game , for example , or 'R-Type DX ' , a faithful recreation of 'R-Type ' on a tiny screen ) . There are some more esoteric applications , too , including a camera , a sonar ( really ) , productivity software , and a sequencer ( as used on Alec Empire 's 'We Punk Einheit ' ) .As a possession , it 's highly desirable - it 's small , stylish and easy to hold , and apart from the fragile battery cover , it seems very solid . It 's slightly bulkier than the Game Boy Pocket , but not off-puttingly so , and keenly-priced , too . Only the high price of the cartridges could put people off , but with several million Game Boys out there ( many of which are presumably restricted to playing 'Tetris ' and nothing else ) , there is a thriving second-hand market .	1
The Game Boy Color is the best portable gaming system around . It 's made all my plane trips go by a lot faster , and for me , that makes it worth the reasonable price . There are hundreds of games out for the Game Boy Color , and many more to come . There are games in all genres , including Adventure , Arcade , Fighting , Racing , Sports , and RPG -- start your GBC Collection with Super Mario Bros. Deluxe and Tetris DX , the two classics . It 's small enough to put in your jacket pocket , and the game cartridges are tiny . The only problem is that you ca n't play it in the dark because it is n't backlit , so you have to buy an extra light to attach onto it . But cons aside , the Game Boy Color is a great investment for hours of entertainment -- at least until summer 2001 , when the Game Boy Advance comes out ( which will also play Game Boy Color and Game Boy Games ) . But until then , I recommend the Game Boy Color to Kids and Adults alike !	1
The GameBoy Color ( picture is a Pocket ? ) is a pricelessly entertaining handheld , for a retro gamer like myself . Blast from the past !	1
I had the teal game boy color for the longest time and loved it to peices but I gave it to my cousins so oh well I 'm getting a new game boy color in purple this time either way the game boy color is excellent the double aa bateries in the game boy color can last for the longest time ever trust me on this I know that for a fact that they can really last long my one cousin was playing my game boy color around christmas time about six years ago and we stayed up until 12:00 midnight playing totally angelica on the game boy color . if your buying a game boy color you wo n't be disappointed it exactly like the game boy advance sp only with out the screen light that 's the only bad thing is that you have to by a light for it .	1
Love gameboys . Ive had a gameboy pocket , advance , and advance sp . I should have bought another sp just because of the backlight . Other than not being bright the gameboy color is good . It is a nice size and very durable . I would suggest getting collectible or one with the battery cover . Mine was a little dirty but i 'm sure i can clean it off . Very nice and love the blue color . It lasts longer on batterys than rechargeable . But i have rechargeable AA 's so it is n't a problem .	1
The Game Boy was a gloriously fantastic handheld back in the day . Things could n't have been better for Nintendo ... .until 1998 . That 's when things went up a notch for the Game Boy line . People do n't want light . People do n't want thin copies of the system ... .okay maybe they still wan na fit it in their pockets , but what the people were asking for ... is color.The Game Boy Color lets you play all of your Game Boy favorites in random color , but it also opens the door into a new colorful library of games ! The Game Boy Color has continued the life span of the original system to 2002.It also saves batteries , as it uses half the amount of batteries the Game Boy uses .	1
I just bought a kiwi colored Game Boy and it is great ! It can play over 400 games and all in color . Nintendo did a brilliant job with this portable video game platform . The graphics for most of the games rock and the sound is loud and clear ( something that was n't really great with older Game Boy models ) .A great thing about the Game Boy is that a lot of the games for N64 and other consoles can be found for this . This is a good thing for some people that do not want to buy an exspensive console . The controls for the Game Boy are also very easy . Just look at the guide for your game and you will see that their are very little manuavers and they will be easy to use.Besides all of those reasons , the number one reason the Game Boy is so popular is because it is portable . Now imagine this toy that can play up to 450 games , has suberb graphics , and crisp and clear sound , can fit right in your pocket . That 's Right ! So , I hope you will go out ( or click ) for a Game Boy . They are truly great things to own for a child , teen , or even an adult . They make great toys and are not that costly . Buy and enjoy.HAPPY GAMING~ !	1
It brings me back to when I was a kid and lives up to how it was in the 90s .	1
One of the best gme player from the past but still a great system of Nintendo ever made . I love it .	1
This is a system for the 1990s ( as I am sure you know ) and is very old school . It is a great system for hand held play , especially if you are into older games .	1
My Grandma got me this console when I was around 6-7 years old . I remember opening it up for the first time , and had no idea how to turn it on , and when I figured it out , I was so excited . I 've had this thing for many many years and it still works great . The only thing thats messed up really is the way the sound works . Like , if I turn the sound circle thing all the way to the max , its less sound then it was at a little before that point . But something I like is it has a headphone jack in it , which the GBA SP Lite does not . I 'm not sure if the original SP did or not , but I like using my earphones when I play a game , so thats a major plus for me . Also , I did loose the back at one point but we bought a different back at a flea market , and it fit just fine . Mine is the purple one , and sure , its got quite a few scratches , dings and dents , but I still play it every now and then , because its a classic , and I loves me some Pokemon Crystal , : ) .	1
With the recent release of the 32-bit Game Boy Advance , you may think that all Game Boy Color systems are next month 's yard sale fodder . Well , that 's just dead wrong . The tall , small-screened systems are still being played by Nintendo fans , even Game Boy Advance owners .	1
At long last the PS1 version of Duke Nukem 3D . This is the game that Duke Nukem Forever is a sequeal to . DN : TM is a fun but dated by today standards , it does play on the PS3 but the graphics kind of spazz out when the screen goes red from lighting , the gameplay is rather tough even on the easy setting but who cares , this is still a fun game to play and once you get used to the controls it 's even better .	1
Today i saw this game at the store for 12 bucks , and i 'm gon na pick it up since i have a PS2 . I rented it 2 times ( after that the dumb stores got rid of their copies ) and it was better than the sega saturn version . The graphics did n't have the neat lighting effects , but the game was a whole lot more like the pc version . If you have a PC get that version , if you have a ps2 get this version , or both . I 'm probably one of the biggest Duke fans in my area , i have the origional Duke 3D for PC , the Atomic Edtion , The sega saturn version ( my 1st copy ) , Duke Manhatten Project , Time to Kill , Land of the Babes , the Duke Nukem album , all of the Duke Nukem action figures , The Duke Nukem screen saver pack , and now this . As the great Duke would say `` Holy S @ $ T ! '' Any way if you are one of the few who do n't have a PS2 yet here 's what will happen to this game.. You know how these losers say the game looks flat ? Lie ! You know how they say the N64 version looks better ? They fogot to tell you the game is cut up ( no nude chix ) , and the textures are super-low res . But with this vesion , when you set up your PS2 for smooth texture mapping , it will make all the `` 2D '' images get smooth edges , and the textures will be nice and smooth . Since the game is almost all sprites ( which is n't realy a bad thing at all , easier to edit on pc ) Every image on screen will look close to a PS2 game ! The reason i do n't give this 5 stars is because you ca n't edit it like the PC version .	1
Duke Nukem games are old and repetitive . But you know what ? WHO CARES ! ? No matter how old and repetitive Duke Nukem gets , it 's still awesome . That 's due to the fact that DUke Nukem can make ANYTHING and EVERYTHING look good . Hell , he can even make taking a dump look awesome ! The one thing I 've noticed about Duke over the years is that he does n't have and hair on his balls , then I realized that hair does n't grow on steel !	1
do i really need to say anything else ? classic duke nukem game . one of the first i played for the playstation . great fps with decent graphics for its time . and of course the classic duke nukem `` battle cries '' always make me laugh.good classic imo .	1
This game is awesome ! It 's a must have . This game must have the most color in history ! It has many levels just like the Original for regular nintendo . Plus it hs a few more opotions . It has a challenge mode which is extremely hard , a Vs mode so you can play your friends , and a & quot ; You VS Boo Mode. & quot ; It 's a very good buy . You 'll like it ! I got a secret to tell ya too . There are secret levels in this game that are beyond hard ! You have to get over 5000000 points in the original mode . If you think about it , it 's not so hard to get that many points . It 's actually really easy.Well I HIGHLY recommend you buy this album . It 's a good buy , well worth your money , and it 's fun.Do n't forget , this game is for GBC ONLY ! That means Game Boy Color .	1
Super Mario Bros. DX is da ba-bomb ! It has tons of replay value including , racing Boo , keeping a calendar , playing Super Mario Bros. 2 ( Japan version ) , getting your fortune told and more . You can even play as Luigi by pressing select at the map screen I love this game ! It is compatible with Game Boy printer and game link . It is by far the best Game Boy game .	1
Super Mario Bros Deluxe was released in 1999 for the Game Boy Color and is essentially a port of one of the best NES games starring Mario . Normally , this idea would have sold millions of copies but Nintendo went an extra mile or two . Super Mario Bros Deluxe is the original game plus extra content that equaled a must buy title . If you were a Game Boy Color owner , you immediately bought this and played the hell out of it.The PROS : You get the original Super Mario Bros , a You Vs. Boo mode where you race against a ghost through some of the game stages , a 2 player VS mode where you and another place race against each other ( connected via the cable link ) , a Challenge mode where for each stage you have to find 5 red coins , a Yoshi egg and beat the high score . There 's also extra content like the ability to print images from the GB printer ( sold separately ) , a program that tells you where the Yoshi eggs are hidden , a built in calendar and a fortune teller program.The CONS : None.It 's a must own title back then and a real treat to play nowadays if you still have the Game Boy Color or Game Boy Advance SP . It was cool to bring around the original game with you ( with the ability to save anywhere ) but the extra modes and content really made it worth its price . Track down a copy because it 's one game you will never ever get tired of playing .	1
If you 're older than 2 you probably heard of Super Mario , with over 200 games to his name he has tried almost every genre ( Yes , even a shooting game ) , he is a bestseller ( The second best selling game ever ) and is the face of video games . So where did his fame come from ? A package game for the original Nintendo . The problem is to experience on the original system you need to find a NES and you have to hope it still work . And I 've never known how legal emulators are . Thankfully Nintendo rereleased the game a few times ( Super Mario all-stars/SNES Wii , NES Classic/ GBA , Virtual Console/Wii 3ds WiiU , And Super Mario Bros Deluxe/ Gameboy Color GBA ) This might be the best . It kept the original look unlike all-stars which might put some disappointed but it is a look that ca n't be beaten . It add a save feature , Boo race , red coin hunt , and even achievements ! This is the best singular port of the game . If you want you can also get the Nes classic version , but this is the best port on a gameboy system . If you had to only get one Gameboy Color game get Pok & eacute ; mon Gold/Silver or this . 5+/5	1
For anyone who remembers the classic gameplay of the origional Super Mario Bros. for your old 8 bit Nintendo Entertainment System back in the mid 80 's rejoice , its back ! The simple nature of this game makes it so wonderful . Its easy for players of all ages and skills to learn very quickly , but will take hours to master . Super Mario Bros. is a true Video game origional . Its simply was the first well executed game of its kind . A side scrolling adventure game , with tasks to be completed that require skill and paitence , not just mindless button mashing.The Game Boy color version is no different . It is a perfect translation of this timeless classic , so give it a whirl and fall in love all over again !	1
Nintendo did a nice job of putting an old game on a kinda new system . Its the first but not the worst !	1
I started playing this game a few months ago and just completed all of it . Super Mario Bros. Deluxe features not only the 1985 NES original levels , but also the Japanese version levels that North American players could n't have before . At that particular time , the only other way that anyone could access those levels was to play Super Mario All Stars for the Super NES/Nintendo Wii . However , the NES Japanese levels were finally included on this 1999 Game Boy Color port/remake . ( For those of you history buffs , the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. was actually named Super Mario Bros. 2 . The North American version of SMB2 was completely different and released in 1988 with Wart as the main archvillain , not Bowser . ) I actually find the Japanese version of the levels very satisfying and much more challenging . Some unusual effects will happen , such as Mario/Luigi jumping off a trampoline and into the air off screen for a couple of seconds , entering a `` negative '' warp pipe that brings you back several worlds ( i.e. , instead of going FORWARD ) , or seeing Goombas walking in the water levels.Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is one of those games that I could NEVER ever quit playing , even if I wanted to . So stop reading this already and get this game ! ! Sadly , Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is n't currently available for download on the Nintendo 2DS/3DS , but it would be very nice if it was . : )	1
This game is just like the original Super Mario Bros. game for the Nintendo . It is super . It is a lot of fun . If you love the Super Mario Bros. game for the Nintendo and you have a Game Boy Color or Game Boy Advance I suggest buying this game . It is a truly great game .	1
This game is fun and it looks just like the nes game . In fact the only thing diff . is that you can play mini games and the camera is zoomed in . The game is worth [ the money ] big time .	1
This game is great . I heard the news that there is going to be a 16 bit version of Super Mario Bros. but I can tell you already this version is better and more authentic.It just has a classic look to it that cant be replaced . The game is very simple and to the point when it comes to concept but contains some very hard obstacles later on . If you love Mario I command you to get this game.You owe it to yourslef and to Mario and Luigi.A perfect 10.I only wish that Nintendo hadnt stopped making Game Boy Color games because we could have seen The Legend Of Zelda , Kid Icarus , Metroid , Ghosts N Goblins and Mad Max on Game Boy Color cartridges if they hadnt stopped making Game Boy Color games.Its sort of sad if you ask me .	1
I remember when I was 6 years old . This my most favorite thing in the world on NES . Now it is back again on game boy color . This time it has ton of extras such as 32 new levels if you beat the game twice and challenges for each level such as collecting red coins or finding Yoshi eggs . You can also race against boo on certain levels . This is a great game . Just like the original but with tons of extras .	1
I was a vivid gamer back in the day , and Mario was always one of my all time favorites . I have long since moved away from the video game scene , but now and then I play the classics on the PC . And when I played this version , I was amazed at how great it had been revived to the GBA . The graphics are the same , the gameplay is the same , the sound is the same , but there is new extras and bonus stuff , a pathway to choose , multi player ect.. I have to say this is the best Mario Bros. ( 1 ) game ever ! Even better then Mario All Stars ( snes ) version ! ! !	1
I was n't alive when the original Super Mario Bros. came out , but I do faintly remember playing it when I was young , and I faintly remember liking it . When I went to Target to get a game , since Pokemon Pinball was n't there , I got this game instead . I realized that this game was a better choice than Pokemon Pinball . First off , the graphics are marvelous , and proves that GBC is just as good as the NES , if not better . Another thing good about this game is the new save system ( I knew it was new because I had a friend who had the original for the NES ) . They also installed a new challenge mode which is very tough , but later in the game , there is a new item in the Toy Box that gives hints to where all the Yoshi Eggs are . The Toy Box has options like Fortune telling which can be very amusing ( And get you five more lives to start with if you get an Extremely Lucky card ) and tons of printouts for the Game Boy Printer . You might also want to have a Link Cable and a friend with this game handy for the Vs. Mode . In this mode , you can race your opponent on the special race courses . You can also play this mode in one-player , with Boo as your opponent . There is also a new Photo Gallery , which takes a picture every time you do something new , like stomp a new enemy , or trade high scores with a friend with the Infared sensor . Yes , I said high scores , another new feature . But this is all aside from the main game . The game is n't really too challenging until the last world , but I noticed that you can jump higher in this game than any other 2D Mario adventure I 've played so far . Once you beat the main game , you get the Star levels , which are a little more challenging anyway . And once you get the high score , you can get to the Lost Levels , which are EXTREMELY hard , and the last of them has TWO Bowsers ! Definetly a great buy , because of all the time put into a game like this .	1
For you Mario freaks who want to play the original , or those ones who are new to video games and do n't have an old NES ( which , sadly , are becoming increasingly rarer as time goes on ) , this is a good substitute . It does n't quite capture the magic many of us old school gamers can remember the first time we saw that screen on our TVs . But the Golden Age of the video gaming industry has passed , and we must continue on . Sorry for getting nostalgic , but there 's still nothing quite as memorable these days as playing the old NES years ago , with a lot of friends gathered around . Perhaps I romantize that era to much of the video game industry , but I have a lot of good memories from that . That 's how boys bond ( and also men - me and my best friends still go and play the N64 -- - the latest wrestling game from THQ and Goldeneye always come in handy ) . And for those parents who are concerned with some of the more mature elements in gaming these days - do n't worry , Mario does n't have anything to be concerned about.Anyway , this includes some new features , like challenges ( find Yoshi 's Egg , 5 red coins , and beat a specified high score ) , races with Boo , a Toy Box ( or something along those lines ) , and some trophies . Also , more intriguing , is that that included the Japanese SMB II or Lost Levels for us American and UK folks or gamers I mean . You have to get 300,000 points on the original , and then Luigi 's head will appear on the gaming menu . Its retitled SUPER MARIO BROTHERS FOR SUPER PLAYERS , and you have to be one to beat it , the difficulty level is so high . It took us a good 13 years to get the game in original 8 bit format . One thing about the screen : its not big enough to get the entire game inside it , so they have Mario look up and down.All in all , a good adaptation . Still , it 'd be nice to see the release of more games like this -- mainly the first two LEGEND OF ZELDA games on one cart . Why do n't they do this ? ? Perhaps with the release of the two new GB Colour Zelda games ( they divided one game into halves and stuck it on the remaining two ) we 'll see a release of those two classic Zelda titles . Other than emulation or on the 8-Bit they 're unavailable . That 's a real travesty.Mike London	1
No visible damage , battery works great , and the game plays fine with no technical difficulties . It really is as if it 's new !	1
Great game . Will never forget it playing on the NES and Gameboy color . I have probably played world 1-1 more than five thousand times .	1
How does one game make an amazing comeback ? Do it like Mario Deluxe did ! Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is a Game Boy Color version of that game that saved the gaming industry . However , there 's a bunch of features in this game that make it even better ! Original 1985 : Play Super Mario Bros -- -- -Updates to game : Luigi is playable by pressing Select , world map , different HUD due to lower screen sizeChallenge : Find hidden red coins and Yoshi eggs in levels from the original gameVS Game : Race the other player in this multiplayer modeBoo ( unlockable ) : Race the ghostLuigi ( unlockable ) : Play Super Mario Bros : The Lost Levels ! Records : High scoresAlbum : View unlockable picturesToy Box : Extra stuff to play around withSo yeah ... .it sure is an improvement .	1
The original Super Mario Brothers came out about the same time that I was born , and I think today its aged better than I have . Having not played the game in years , I was craving some Mario and decided to dust Super Mario Bros. Deluxe off ; I 'm glad that I did . I forgot not only how well this game transitions to the small screen , but just how many features Nintendo managed to cram into the game . There is huge replay value to be had here , which comes in the form of an additional full game , side challenges , and other minigames . While the original Super Mario Bros. was pretty challenging , the developers have added a save anytime and endless continues to ease the frustration level of the player . The only demerit the game gets from me is the fact that the whole game does n't fit on the screen , so you have to move up and down accordingly , which caused me to lose a couple lives because of an enemy that I could n't originally see on the screen . I do n't need to write up anything about the gameplay , chances are you 've played a side-scrolling Mario game at some point of your life . If you have n't , stop reading this and go play right now . Otherwise , this game is perfect for those craving a little old school Mario Brothers action .	1
This game is the account to the SNES version , its graphics are way better than the original , it even holds alot of secrets , EX . Get enough points and you can play `` The Lost Levels , boo race '' and more ! not to mention this game is such a great gift for the little ones , it is so easy , my little brother ( Whose is 6 ) has almost completed the game !	1
It 's been nearly fifteen years since the plumber wandered into the Mushroom Kingdom , and gaming has never been the same since . When the NES was released in 1985 , the game that shipped with the system was the instant classic Super Mario Bros. And what better way to kick off the first year of the Game Boy Color 's life than with a true Mario game ? The Game Boy Color game Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is a pixel-by-pixel translation of the original NES game , with a ton of added features . And because the original Super Mario Bros. still holds up extremely well after all these years , Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is an absolutely fantastic game that borders on perfection ? perfection in Game Boy standards , of course . There are many different modes in the game , but the main game is the 1985 classic Super Mario Bros. 32 levels of platform-hopping gameplay where you must go through the world , jumping on enemies and collecting coins , making your way to the next castle before time runs out . Collect 100 coins and you 've earned a secret life . Make sure you jump on ... aww , skip it . You 've played this game before . What you have n't played are the new modes injected in the Game Boy Color version . The Vs. Mode requires two Game Boy Colors and a link-cable , but this game is a whole lot of fun . It 's a race to the flag pole between Mario and Luigi , and you 'll try to screw each other up by hitting triggers that will put blocks up in the way . Very cool use of the original Super Mario Bros. engine , and worth the purchase of another cartridge just for this feature alone . Super Mario Bros. Deluxe also has a Challenge Mode , where you 'll have to find five red coins and a Yoshi egg , as well as beat the level 's preset score to finish the level completely . This is pretty darn difficult , hope you have a lot of patience . When I say pixel-perfect , I mean it . Even though the Game Boy Color screen has less resolution than a standard television , the developers have translated the same pixel count for every object in the game , from Mario to the koopas , turtles , even the question-mark blocks . Granted , this reduces the screen visibility somewhat , but the developers have added user-controlled screen-scrolling to the mix . If you want to see above or below where you 're standing , it 's all a matter of pushing up or down on the pad . All 32 levels , from 1-1 to 8-4 are patterned after the levels in the NES classic . Nothing 's changed . Well , that 's not exactly true , you can now save your game in progress , something you could not do in the original . It also remembers which levels you 've completed , and unlocks secrets based on how many you 've finished . So it 's not always a good thing to find the warp zones so early in the game . Secrets ? That 's right . As you complete certain tasks in the game , you open up little hidden trinkets . Things like a Photo Album where you can print out earned pictures on your Game Boy Printer , or a Toy Box where you can make messages and print them out . Oh , and just because they could , the developers stuck in a fortune teller ( just think `` Mario Magic 8 Ball '' ) and a calendar option where you can enter important dates and save them to a cartridge . Do they need to be in there ? Of course not . But they 're cool additions nontheless . Super Mario Bros. remains one of my top 10 favorite games of all-time , even though it 's almost a decade and a half old . Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is such a perfect translation , it makes me wonder if it 's easy to port NES games to the Game Boy Advance . Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is the Game Boy Color-specific game to own , hands down , and will be the title that , hopefully , will key a revolution of porting NES games to the handheld system . Buy this game . Now .	1
Super Mario Brothers Deluxe is an exact copy of the original Nintendo game . All the same graphics , levels , and even cheats are the same . Even if you beat the original game , this version has a few things added . There 's a mode where you race a friend or the computer , a table which has all the Toads that you 've unlocked which will let you print out banners and such on the game boy printer , a fortune teller where if you are very lucky you earn five extra lives , and a challenge mode where you have to have a high score , gain red coins and find a yoshi 's egg . There is also a picture gallery similar to Zelda Dx . which has pictures of enemies and scenes from the game . This game is pure fun .	1
Super Mario Bros. for the NES revolutionized video gaming , no questions asked . Accordingly , a rerelease for the Game Boy Color seemed fitting . All 32 levels from the NES classic are back , in all their pixelated glory . The music is left unchanged from the NES as well ! Plus , once you beat the 32 normal levels , you get to play through them again in an expert mode with tougher enemies more common and smaller lifts . Beat those and you get 32 NEW levels , from the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. 2 ( these are often called & quot ; The Lost Levels & quot ; in America . ) In addition to these amazing features , there is a challenge mode where you must find a hidden Yoshi egg , 5 red coins , and get a high score . There 's even a mode where you have to race to the end of a unique level against Boo ! Lastly , the game contains several extras you can print out with your Game Boy Printer , which increase in number as you progress through the game . BY ALL MEANS PURCHASE THIS GAME IF YOU OWN A GBC or GBA .	1
Forget all those 3D games that are practically carbon copies of one another , constantly ripping off the character concepts that Street Fighter invented . This is the definitive fighting game for the Playstation.The graphics will be familiar to anyone who 's played Street Fighter or the Alpha series , but they do have a newer , fresher anime style about them . The large anime drawing of the characters after they win a match is also very cool . They animate very well , much better than in Marvel vs. Capcom . The sound effects are also great , and the music is excellent . My only minor complaint about the music is that the classic character themes are gone . I preferred the old classic songs to these new ones . But , that 's not too big of a deal.Anyone who says this game has no depth simply does n't have a clue about its system . Each character has three different fighting styles , each with distinct advantages and disadvantages . Some moves and super moves are only available in certain fighting styles . Some fighting styles are better for attacking , and others are better defense , counters , and reversals.The super moves are not as spectacular as a Capcom vs. title , but they 're still excellent in themselves . They are also not insanely powerful , unless the character has been trained and leveled up a whole lot . Which brings me to my next favorite aspect of this game : The World Tour mode . This was a great addition to Street Fighter . Some say it 's been ripped off from Soul Edge or Soul Caliber , but considering how badly other games have ripped off Street Fighter over the years ( all the SF clones on the SNES , and even Tekken rips off the characters now ) , I do n't think that argument can stand . This mode allows you to choose a character and go on a world tour , fighting lots of matches with different stipulations , such as super combos only , multiple opponents , etc . As you do this , your character raises levels and gains new abilities , perhaps being able to use some abilities that his fighting style would not normally allow . You also gain the ability to change your balance of power , making your character lean more toward offense to hit harder , or defense to take less damage , or remain neutral.In fact , this game has all sorts of cool extra features to be unlocked , as well as secret characters . Now , there are not many secret characters at all , but those that are there are far better than most of the ones in Tekken ( Come on now -- you ca n't seriously hope to compare Gon , Mokujin , or even True Ogre to Shin Akuma ) . The other features include the Dramatic Battle , which lets you fight 2 on 1 against the computer at high difficulty , the Survival Mode , which lets you see how far you can get as both the difficulty and number of simultaneous opponents increase , and the Final Battle , which simply lets you choose any character and fight the last boss so that you do n't have to play them all the way through the Arcade Mode . With all these cool extras , plus the fact that the Arcade Mode actually has a good story behind it , this game never runs out of replay value . You 're always looking for something new to try , or just to pop the game in for a quick play.One of the coolest aspects of this game is its characters . There is a huge variety to choose from , and each is played differently than the next . At the same time though , none of the characters really seem silly or out of place , except perhaps Rainbow Mika ... That 's a matter of opinion I guess.Overall , this is the best Street Fighter game I 've ever played , and the best fighting game in general that I 've ever played . It 's easily worth 5 stars , perhaps with a half a star removed for not using the classic tunes .	1
streetfighter is a must have for the streetfighter fan everywhereif you had this in the day of ps1 and your into streetfighter old school , you will love this title ! ! come complete with unlockable features and alpha combos ! !	1
Street fighter alpha 3 might be the best street fighter out there to date . It has awesome game modes cool levels and best of all its the never ending fun of a 2d fighter . The graphics are what you would expect froma 3d fighter a little choppy and an occasional glitch or two or maybe an occasional mergence of fighters but all in all its one of my favorite game out there . Ihave been an avis street fighter fan all the way back to the SNES version of street fighter 2 turbo ! i would encourage anybody to get street fighter alpha 3 because its fun and hey its down to 20 bucks now !	1
Street Alpha 3 really rocked in the Arcades and when they brough it to the homes of millions on the PSone , it still rocked , it looked great and of course how could you forget the many characters you had to choose from . In total ( I want to say ) 34 or 35 ? total characters including hidden characters . A definite up scale from the original Street Fighter Alpha where there 's only 8 or 10 characters and 2 of which you could 've easily done without ( Sodom and Birdie ) .Also in this one , the special moves changed because now you got to chose which set you wanted which was cool for some characters and detrimental to the success of some of the other characters.I 'd still definately get this one because it 's that good and even so , how could you not continue to collect the Street Fighter series ? PLEASE ! You know you want to so go ahead and get it !	1
Now most people will read the title and think he must talking about the game . After all this is the third game in the Alpha series . No , I called this review that because this is my third copy of Alpha 3 lol . I had the Alpha Anthology first , then I got Alpha 3 Max on the PSP , now I have this . So , why get this game . Simply put I have an arcade stick and I want to play it with that on my PS3 . So , I had to buy it again in order to do that . This game plays like and dream and looks great . I am impressed at how well the PS1 handled this game . It looks like the Anthology version which I would assume is the best , just because the hardward in more advanced . You really can not tell the difference between the two other than load times existing in this version and not in that one . Ima keep this brief if you like Street Fighter you need to own this . This really needs to be a game Capcom puts online . I do n't know if there is much of an out cry for it but there should be . Its up there to me as one of the all time greats . With Capcom vs SNK 2 and other great 2-D games of that era . Its fun , its bright and viberant its just one of the best SF games ever made period .	1
I owned this game and it was a challenging , fun game . Modes like the one where you have to beat people using only combos is a true challenge . The game itself is loaded with a lot of characters which is cool .	1
While eveverybody says Street Fighter III the 3rd strike is there favorite SF game & I do think it should be up there with Street Fighter II & IV Street Fighter Alpha 3 is my favorite Street Fighter game the Alpha series takes place before Street Fighter II basically the Alpha series as a whole tells the story of Akuma killing Ryu & Ken 's master & Akuma going around & killing people & M.Bison taking over Shadowloo trying to capture Ryu for his Psycho Drive Ryu travelling around the world to be the best Ken 's desire for a rematch with Ryu . Charlie Nash & Chun Li investigating Shadowloo & trying to bring Bison to justice . Sagat after losing to Ryu joins Shadowloo Cammy turning against Shadowloo . Now I just want to put this little update I want to talk about the other version of Street Fighter Alpha 3 the Japaneese only Sega Saturn port . The Playstation version is very good but this is my opinion this is the best port . When you start out Guile Evil Ryu are already in the game . This version is almost arcade perfect & you do n't have to unlock any of the characters . Evil Ryu being in this game fits for future referance in the later games espically Street Fighter IV . Guile figures into the plot he 's going to find Charlie who The Military think has goneAWOL Charile 's fate is different if you play as Guile . It does add plot points & connects to SF II very well . It plays well it 's perfect for the Ascii arcade stick or the regular Saturn controller . This is closer to the arcade version it does play better than the Playstatin version . You will need a Action Replay 4MB RAM cart if you choose to get this but this game can be expensive I got mine for $ 130 I believe it depends on how big of a Street Fighter fan you are I mean if you have Street Fighter Alpha 1 & 2 on Saturn it 's a great finish to the series . It is my favorite game in the Alpha series.Pretty much the entire Alpha series is story driven & I ca n't do the games justice but I do recommend it to Street Fighter fans or anybody that 's serious about getting into fighting games in general .	1
Alpha 3 is the culmination of everything Capcom had worked towards with their fighting games . Everyone knows Capcom has the habit of sticking to similar concepts for several games in a row ( Mega Man , Resident Evil , etc ) , but in no other case has the last game in a series before a major change been so fulfilling.Street Fighter Alpha 3 is ( in my opinion ) the best Street Fighter game available ( including the recently-released SF2 HD Remix ) . The gameplay is a blend of the slow-paced and strategic Street Fighter 2 and the more varied and frenetic Alpha series . Air combos , alpha counters , and flashy finishing moves combine with superior character balancing and deep fighting strategy.The main `` arcade '' experience can be brutally hard , as it would be in the wishes of any Street Fighter fan . The two-player experience is also extremely fun , as players new to the Alpha series can choose different fighting modes , one of which ( X-ism ) is more aligned with classic SF2 balancing . Other modes include A-ism , the Alpha standard , and V-ism , a mode that enhances a player 's ability to chain standard and special moves together for lethal damage.Alpha 3 introduced an incredible World Tour mode , enabling players to tour the world ( if you will ) fighting various characters under various conditions . These tasks may be as simple as defeating an opponent to as complex as defeating three opponents with only super combo moves whilst your character is low on health . Completing these objectives unlock abilities that can be linked to your character , such as automatic blocking , taking zero damage while blocking , infinite guard , and more . On top of that , characters built up during World Tour mode are playable in other many of the other modes.The other gameplay modes include training , boss battle , survival , and more . Two-player battles can also accommodate multiple player characters , in both versus and cooperative ( ie P1 and P2 vs C1 and C2 , or P1 and P1 vs P2 and P2 ) . Two-player back in the days of SSF2 : Turbo was the only way to play , but Alpha 3 dramatically increased the available options for single players . These lend towards the game 's long life , as one player can play in various modes ranging from standard arcade style to fighting bosses to survival mode and more.In essence , Street Fighter Alpha 3 defines fighting games of the Playstation era . It is a smooth balance of speed and strategy . Though the graphics are dated by today 's standards , two-dimensional games tend to age gracefully , and this game is no exception . Street Fighter fans owe it to themselves to own a copy of Alpha 3 , if not to check a popular franchise 's history , then to own the best Street Fighter game ever made .	1

... and I remember when Street Fighter II appeared in Arcades some ... uh ... was it 15-16 years ago or more ? , with cast of INCREDIBLE 8 characters and INCREDIBLE 6 attack buttons . My cousin had to master ALL 8 fighters and asked me 'Which end would u like to see ? 'Alpha series brought modernisation AND super-attack option , which you can use when your super meter is up.Alpha 3 is the best sequel , and do n't download ROM for arcade , since PS version has several fighters more than arcade version.I know this is age of Tekken 5 and Virtua fighter Evolution , but if you can run PS games , BUY SFA 3 !	1
Street Fighter Alpha 3 is the best Street Fighter experience one can have on the original Playstation . With well over 20 characters selectable from the outset , classic Street Fighter gameplay , and multiple gameplay modes , this is one fighting game worthy of adding to any gamer 's library . There are a few faults though . Some animation problems are present here and there ( some characters have newly animated moves that do n't quite fit with their old set of animation frames ) , the endings could have had more attention paid to them , and some of the music is rather bland . Also , for those of you who may not know , the Alpha series is supposed to take place between the events of the original Street Fighter and Street Fighter 2 . So why are we seeing characters appear that are from the later versions of Street Fighter 2 , such as Deejay , Fei Long , T. Hawk and Cammy ? Even though Capcom may need to work on the story a bit , it 's still nice to see all of the Street Fighters together in one game , so I 'm not complaining . Even though there have been countless versions of Street Fighter before it , Street Fighter Alpha 3 proves that you ca n't beat a classic formula , and that the series is still very enjoyable . Unless you 're completely burnt out on 2D fighting games , I recommend picking up Street Fighter Alpha 3 for either Playstation or Dreamcast .	1
Alpha 3 has a roster that will take you months to master each character . I have n't seen so many Street Fighter characters ( 31 ) in one game before for the PS and PS2 . The unique feature of this game is the ISM system where you can choose which finisher move you want . The best feature is the World Tour which is practically a Street Fighter RPG ( why ca n't the new Street Fighter games have this ? ! ) where you level up your character as you win matches .	1
If you are a Street Fighter die hard fan , then this game must be in your collection . As a SFII fan myself , I rate this the best compared to even the Playstation 2 versions . It is simply the most playable and the most fun incarnation of the game . Do yourself a favor and get this one . You wo n't regret it .	1
To be perfectly frank , the Microsoft Sidewinder is the most underrated joystick ever made . My previous joystick was a Logitech Wingman Extreme . Within six months of purchase , the Wingman was falling apart - calibration was non-existent and the rubber case was disintegrating.So I bought the Microsoft Sidewinder Pro . And what a fantastic joystick it was - it 's excellent for flight/space simulators like I-War or X-Wing : Alliance . The precision of this joystick is amazing.So , if you 're looking for a high-quality joystick at a reasonable price , get this one . It 's still one of the most robust and reliable joysticks on the market .	1
This joystick is great for all kinds of games particularly flight sims . I love its rudder controls . All you have to do is twist the stick left or right . It has tons of buttons , all fully programmable . If you want to buy a joystick , definetly purchase this one , do n't get the force feedback , that stick is just plain annoying .	1
I 'm not a great fun of Microsoft but I have to admit that they did a great job with this joystick , just for once . I bought the Saitek Cyborg 3D . Same price . It was horrible . Unstable . It was cool looking but what 's the use a cool joystick when you ca n't land your plane with it because it sends random signals to your pc ? Sidewinder is precise and reliable . Also it 's multipurpose . I use it for Falcon 4 and Need for Speed and it 's great with both .	1
I have 'flown ' regularly for almost 4 years on AirWarrior , using the same stick ( non-USB model ) . It works as well as it did on day # 1 . The Microsoft site has an updated Win98 control panel for programming the stick ( fast , free and easy download ) painlessly . It is bullet-proof .	1
After having tested several joysticks , this is the one I kept coming back to . I 've had a version of this joystick on my system for two years , and have yet to find anything better . I do n't at all agree with the ... ... editorial review that says it 's got stiff joystick movement . Quite to the contrary , it 's capable of very subtle movement.Plus , it 's got lots of features without being over-engineered . I especially like the fact that it comes with both throttle and rudder control within easy reach . The button cluster on the stick itself is very sensibly designed , with all major buttons a comfortable distance apart . The hat is cleverly devised as well , being both solid and flexible . Most importantly , perhaps , the software , now at least two years old , is very stable , and allows you complete control over each button.Yet , there are some people who might not find this product enjoyable . As others have commented , it is a very right-hand-centric design . Since there are a host of buttons on the left-hand side of the base , you ca n't hold the joystick in your left hand and access those buttons without crossing your hands . Also , the cluster of buttons on the joystick itself are designed to fit the right hand . If you 're a right-handed person , this design is ergonomically perfect . It literally fits in the palm of your ( right ) hand . But a left-handed person has no business whatever buying this product.Neither does a Mac owner . This product 's USB connectivity , though convenient to Windows users , does not extend to the Mac . That 's an unfortunate oversight that , one suspects , would n't be all that difficult to correct.Still , if you only intend to use this thing on a Windows machine , and if you 're right handed , you 'd be hard-pressed to find a better joystick .	1
After I oiled up the joystick , it was much more responsive afterward . the controller worked well when I got it , but now it works even better .	1
Over the years , there has been many video game systems , starting from the Atari in the early 1980s to the Playstation 2 in the early 2000s . Each one has a unique controller . The early ones , such as NES and Super NES are awkward . Same with the Playstation , Playstation 2 , and the Dreamcast . But when we come to the Nintendo 64 controller , we find something completely different . The designers seem to have gotten the shape just right so that your hands can fit comfortably in the best position to play games , with each button placed at the most convenient places so you do n't have to reach for them . And unlike the old controllers , your hands are n't cramped so the only pain you feel is if you 're playing Mario Party without the gloves.And black is just a cool color.Alas , my controller has been the victim of my frustrations , so I would need a new one ,	1
Bought this and May Flash N64 Controller Adapter for PC USB for My Laptop and after i installed it and googled how to set it up to work with games on my computer in a couple of minutes i had my new N64 controller all set up and ready to play games on my PC and i 've used it many times and still works as good as the day i got it	1
It was as described and as well as clean , great product ! I 've been playing with it for a few weeks now and it feels nostalgic to be using a like new controller !	1
This is the best used controller I have bought in my hunt . The stick worked great as well as all the buttons . I am very happy with this . Thank you so much .	1
Controller was much needed after tossing it on the floor a few times LOL It is still working so it was a good buy	1
The seller I bought it from sold it to me with brand-new conditions , but what else can I say , it 's a black controller that suits me well .	1
Just as difficult as I remember .	1
Oh boy , what 's not to love about this game ? It 's an instant classic.In Oddworld , you play a slave called Abe , who works at the meat-processing plant Rupture Farms . Abe 's a Mudokon , hardly your typical cute platform hero , but a gangly , orange-eyed , green-skinned creature with a samurai 's tuft of hair and the posture of an ape . The story 's premise is that the factory 's owners have found a tasty new treat to whip into production since they ran their last `` dish '' into extinction . The problem is , it 's you . Or more precisely , the Mudokons . When an eavesdropping Abe finds this out , he starts ham-stepping stage left , right quick , proving that curiosity can save the cat , too . Your goal , as Abe , is to escape Rupture Farms , liberating as many fellow Mudokons as possible , and find a way to bring down the entire plant . But playing a Christ figure is n't as easy as we 'd all like to think . Using a limited vocabulary set , Abe must convince the Mudokons to follow him to safety , all the while racing through the factory flipping switches , avoiding obstacles , evading heavily armed guards , and staying alive.Give me more , we need more games like this one .	1
a fun and extremely weird game . if I remember it right you had to get pretty far in the game before you were able to save , but the fact that you can die as many times as you want made up for that.its good that you can die a lot , because you WILL die a lot ! anything and everything kills Abe in one shot . great gameplay and a really funny story	1
I remember playing this game in my teens , still as fun now as it was for me back then . Thank you !	1
thank you so much i have n't played this game for a very long time and have n't been able to find it anywhere until i came across your site sooo thank you very much	1
After 90 or so inaccurate reviews , I have this to say : Epic Superman has awesome graphics , gameplay , voice-acting ; and it 's flight engine -- something alot people do n't seem to understand so they bash the game ; well , you see : people like me and Mah boi , Superman , can actually fly therefore we can accurately review Epic Superman . This game also has multi-player , which is nearly as good as Black Ops . If only there were online play.. -- I have to say , THIS is an accurate simulation of flight and the BEST game on a Nintendo console . Ever .	1
This needs to be remade on the current systems . This game alone is reason enough to invest in a Nintendo 64 gaming system . The controls are amazing and the gameplay is addictive . 5/5	1
This game is so much fun you get to fly through rings then try to stop a car from hitting a business man but you never can its great !	1
I had this on the Sega CD Rom and I think that this is one of the best games ever released . If you have n't played it ... .. GET IT , and if you have , then get it again . Althought the story line in Lunar 2 is better the actually game play is a lot more fun in this one . If you are looking for an RPG to play then this is definetly one that you should try	1
This is an old fashioned RPG that may not appeal to those who have only known the likes of Final Fantasy X , FFX-2 , and Xenosaga . There 's not a lot of cutscenes here to help tell the story . No fancy soundtrack . Very little voice acting , which is a shame considering the voice actor for Ghaleon did a wonderful job . There 's nothing like an elaborate prologue or ending that you got out of Xenosaga . Instead , gamers will have to depend on lots of reading and playing to make the story unfold.Battles are quite challenging . Basically , you plan the moves for all of your characters and then turn control over to the battle system . There is also an option to have the battle system fight for you , but this mode is not recommended.This game 's story is very mild and shallow compared to the other RPGs mentioned above . LSSS 's strong points are definitely fighting and solving puzzles . The story is a lightweight . And definitely not for those looking for something along the lines of & quot ; epic & quot ; .	1
Ok.. I 'll be honest here . I read couple reviews and sensing that this game is 'bit ' over-rated . ( I sense people who wrote reviews frowning ) I did finish this game and trust me , I had lot of expectation for this game . I have n't played the Sega CD version of it and actually blamed one of the reviewers from EGM , who gave 8.5 when rest of them gave 9 or higher . I thought this game deserves at least 9 , I mean , look at the animation , the title animation is one of the most well-represented animated beginning ever , and the music was just amazing . I was constantly humming the tune because it was so , so , SO GOOD- could n't help myself from humming it all the time . Not only that , Working Design did a fantastic/excellent job on putting in all the extra you are getting with this game , it 's simply amazing- I 'm left with no choice but to give credit for that . However , after I finish the game , I realized that I came to conclusion too soon , when I did play only beginning portion of the game , mesmerized with beautifully animated movie scene.I was n't inspired or felt that heartache or anything like that..I mean , characters are adorable and the story is good enough to pull you in , however , it was n't just strong enough-So when I read several reviews saying this is the best RPG for PS or anything like that , I just could n't agree with what they were saying , of course , everyone has right to their own opinion , but in my humble opinion , I just did n't feel it . It seemed to me that I 'm more attracted to the games with more stronger theme , like Xenogear , and Lunar falls into mild-themed game , which is , of course , enjoyable.I did n't buy the sequel , Eternal Blue , which comes with more extra and whole box for the game looks great , however , I was n't inspired enough to purchase Eternal Blue because it was n't just there to hook me , was n't just there ... Well , it 's definitely your call.. so if the price is reasonable for you and plenty of time , then give it a try and see how it goes . It 's nice to have this game if you are a collector , however , I would n't buy this game if you are picking this ONE RPG to enjoy in your busy life , because there are better RPGs out there for PSOne in my humble opinion .	1
Originally released on the Sega CD , the developers thought that there could be some enhancements . So it ended up here and although graphically it looks like it came from the Sega CD era , the other enhancements and not to mention the great story and characters is more than enough to get this . Just good luck finding it , since it was in such demand , Working Designs stopped making them and made it incredibly rare to find.The story starts off in the town of Burg where the hero , Alex , dreams of becoming like his hero , Dragonmaster Dyne , who died under mysterious circumstances . Then the hero searches for the White Dragon to become like his hero and from there , he ends up in a battle for the entire land of Lunar . It seems like a straightforward story with plot twists you 'll probably see a mile away but the way that it 's executed is so masterful.There 's some much needed humor in the game involving some pop culture references , such as when a traveller tells Nall ( a flying cat ) how much licks does it take to get the the center of a Tootsie Pop when it was an owl in the commercial.The music is n't incredibly memorable but it adds life and great background to each location and event the music is featured . The voice acting is amazing some great voices . The one thing that feels odd to me is the voice of Alex , Ashley Angel , is a member of the boy-band O-Town . Although it is n't the most baddest thing in the world , it feels odd.Do n't expect mind-blowing visuals . These look quite old but they do n't retract from the gameplay . The anime scenes though are incredibly beautiful that range from simple character intros to big plot points . The animation seems so colorful and vibrant rather than looking a little too & quot ; adult & quot ; . Even has some CG elements like Luna 's song on the boat or something further in the game I 'm not spoiling for you.If you can find it or borrow off somebody , play this immediately and experience the world of Lunar .	1
I 'm one of the ten or so people who actually bought a Sega CD and , like many ( if not all ) , I believe this was the best RPG for that otherwise disappointing system . Lunar : Silver Star Story Complete brings me back to the good ol ' days of RPGs before the likes of Final Fantasy VII and VIII were called the best RPGs ever by newbie gamers who just do n't know any better . The story was flawless and breathtaking then , and yet , somehow , it all seems better this time around . What makes Lunar Lunar though is the fact that Working Designs was behind it . They can translate even the lamest games and make them playable ( I even bought Shining Wisdom for my Saturn just because of Working Designs ! ) . The people at Working Designs are a bunch of comedians . There are so many jokes in this game it 's unbelievable ( second only to Final Fantasy IX in humor ) . The game has received an upgrade in every single way , most notably , the graphics . Yes , the graphics are n't an important part of any game , but it 's nice to see that they got an uplift this time around . Back to the story though . Everything about the story is perfect , it 's beautiful , it 's touching , and it 's one of the best in any game I have ever seen . I could go into more detail ... but you should really play it for yourself . What surprised me about playing Lunar again was the length of the game . It 's pretty long . While not as long as its sequel , it still offers days of fun like I had with the original version . The characters themselves are great . Typical of their RPG times ? Yes , but great nonetheless . Especially Alex and Nall , who I just loved . The difficulty of the game is very applaudable as well . Not incredibly difficult , but it 's not easy either , and that 's just another reason why I love this game so much . The one thing that did n't stand the test of time was the battles . They 're very straight-forward and basic , nothing to it at all . It 's just tap ... tap ... tap . Boring indeed . Thankfully the random number of battles is n't frequent . The packaging also needs mention . Lunar : SSSC comes with a nice box that contains a 100+ page leatherette hardbound artbook/instruction manual , a making of Lunar CD , a music CD , and a full-color cloth map . Who loves ya ? Working Designs ! Unfortunately , new-school gamers might be put off by Lunar 's old-school look and feel continuously asking & quot ; Where 's Bahamut Zero ? & quot ; This is unfortunate because it looks like Lunar might go back to the cult status it had on the Sega CD instead of selling by the truckloads like it deserves . Oh well ... definitely their loss . Nevertheless , this is a masterpiece . Lunar : SSSC should be as mandatory as the controller for PSX owners . Truly one of the best RPGs of all time ... hey , you know the drill : If you 're a gamer , you owe it to yourself to buy this . Oh yes , do n't forget to pick up the sequel as well .	1
If you are looking for story as the driving force behind an RPG , then this is a game you will enjoy . Lunar does n't rely on graphics or amazing sound . It relies on the strength of its storyline . The graphics are the type you 'd find on an older system , which makes sense because this game was originally released on the Sega-CD . This comes with two bonus CD 's . One is a soundtrack , which is nothing to be excited about since the music is n't something you 'd want to listen to outside of the game , but is a nice touch . The other is a making of CD that was rather interesting because you get to see how much the people who made this game were into it and cared about the finished product.One of the neat things about this game is all of the voice acting . It 's such a nice touch and really adds a lot to the game . The female voices can seem rather whiny and too high pitched ( which could be said of the males at times too ) , but other than that , it 's quite good . Also , there is a lot of pop culture references and innuendo going on that make you laugh . That may be the best thing about the game . The story is fun . The game is fun . You have fun playing the game.It 's not new . It 's not full of eye candy . But the game is very enjoyable and worth the money if you enjoy playing with a good story .	1
I would say that Lunar is a worthy RPG and definitely still worth playing if you have an appreciation for the classics . However , it may not be worth paying the exorbitant used prices ( the cheapest I found my copy was $ 60 , then one of the discs was all scratched up and nonfunctioning , and I had to buy new discs for $ 30 ! Yikes ! ) . Anyway , let 's see if Lunar withstands the test of time.Graphics ( score 8/10 ) : Well , since this version of Lunar ( the Playstation version ) was enhanced from the original , it looks really good for an older RPG , especially when compared to the playstation ports of Final Fantasy V and VI . However , the graphics are still undeniably dated . On the bright side , anime cutscenes are interspersed throughout the game . There 's also an anime portrait whenever they speak , which adds much needed detail to the characters ( so you can see what they really look like ) .Music ( score 7/10 ) : Music is decent , nothing that would make you buy the soundtrack or anything . There are a couple vocal tracks in the game , which are also decent . Thankfully , Luna 's singing voice is n't too grating on the ears . I still do n't understand , though , why everyone in the game keeps referring to her amazing singing voice , when in my opinion , she is only average . Well anyway , there is limited voice acting in the game during scenes and also a couple battle phrases . The voice acting is pretty good ; the only voice I 'm glad we do n't hear much of is Nall 's , which I imagine would get really annoying ( it 's high-pitched and squeaky ) . You do n't get to hear much voice acting anyway , since it 's really only present during cutscenes.Characters ( score 8/10 ) : Characters are likeable and amusing . They do have a decent amount of depth to their personalities , so you really come to be attached to them . Because the story is so basic , the likeable characters are really what keep this game afloat . Also , some of the NPCs are downright hilarious ! Story ( score 7/10 ) : Lunar is certainly no Final Fantasy VII . The story itself is pretty basic . You start off as Alex , who sets off on a quest to become a Dragonmaster ( person of status who helps keep things in order and peace ) . Then the story falls into the old pattern of finding X number of things ( in this case , 4 dragons ) and saving the world from a power-hungry would-be ruler along the way . This is sort of the formula for every RPG in existence , but at least other games add in unique and intriguing twists on this old formula to keep things interesting . Lunar 's storyline really has no extra twists or new concepts in it to keep things interesting ( thus it relies on excellent characterization ) . I really wish the game had explored certain concepts in more detail , such as the why the Vile Tribe rejected Althena , Ghaleon 's motivations , and Althena 's personality , motivations , and origin . However , given the age of this game , the lack of story depth is forgivable . After all , almost all games made during this time period were pretty shallow story-wise.Battle System ( score 8/10 ) : Battles are a basic turn-based system . The usual attack , defend , magic , item commands . As an interesting twist , you can move around the battle screen , thus making position a part of strategy . The only complaint I have with battles is that there is an `` A.I . '' command , whereby you can have the battle automatically fought for you . I did n't really like this because the option is listed first in the menu , which means you 'll spend some time accidentally hitting it . It would 've been better if they 'd put it at the bottom of the menu . Well , this is n't really a big deal since the cursor in the game `` remembers '' where you last had it and always starts up there . So , once you turn on the game and select `` command '' , the next battle will have the cursor already on `` command '' . This was quite convenient.Gameplay ( score 7/10 ) : This is a bit of a catch-all category for me . One thing of note is that the menu system was a bit confusing , at least for me . I really felt that it was needlessly complicated and I never quite got the hang going through it quickly . It 's rather annoying having every party member have their own `` equip '' menu when you could just have one big `` equip '' option , and then just select a character from there . I also hated having to physically put equipment in the person 's hand before I could equip it . It would 've been better to just let me select a person , and then have every available piece of equipment in inventory for them pop up in a list . Shuffling items from Nall 's inventory to each individual character 's inventories is a pain , especially if their inventory is full , and you have to move items out first . Well , anyway , also of note is the leveling system . Bosses are always the same level as Alex is , but regular enemies all have their own preset levels . This means that you must strike a delicate balance between under-leveling and over-leveling . I really liked this feature since it kept you from having to level grind all the time . Also , enemies appear onscreen -- so there are no random battles , which is awesome . Overall , the gameplay is very smooth and enjoyable , especially for an older game.Overall ( score 7/10 ) : NOTE this score is not an average ; it 's my subjective overall score . Overall , this was a decent , enjoyable game . Even though the story is n't the best , I really enjoyed the characters and they kept me playing . Is this game worth playing ? Yes . Is this game worth the eventual $ 90 I had to spend on it ? Definitely not . I personally do n't think this game is worth more than $ 40 . If you can find it for less than that , then go for it . If not , then you might want to try the GBA remake , Lunar Legend ( though I do n't know how good it is , since I 've never played it ) . If you do n't happen to ever play this game , then it 's no real loss since there are plenty of contemporary RPG 's available that are much better .	1
I had just started playing rpg 's when I picked this one up , it was probably my third or fourth rpg that I played . I absolutely fell in love with this game the moment it started . I never played the orignal or second on the Sega CD.Storyline : What can I say , its your typical boy loves girl , girl gets kidnapped and boy saves world and girl . Fortunately , rpg 's are great not because of the story but how the story is told and Working Designs did a brilliant job in the storytelling . They took the story and put a few twists here and there but not to the extreme or completely insane , they left it a simple story and made it an epic masterpiece . Lastly , this game has one of the most memorable villians in an rpg to date . Ghaleon is a great villian who has a great background story that unfolds extremely well during the game and in my eyes he ranks right up there with Sephiroth.Combat system : For whatever reasons Working Designs left it simple and turn based and keeping to the sprites instead of trying to make the fights 3-D. With games like FFVII , Legaia and others going 3-D this gave a lot of ridicule to the game itself , a very unfortunate thing too . It was nice for the characters to have only certain things they could do , like Alex could only use special sword attack and no magic as where Jessica could only use magic . It kept the fighting more tactical and also made everyone in the group important and not just a space filler.Graphics : Working Designs kept to the sprites and kept it looking a 32 bit rpg . They did do something to keep the story moving along with anime clips , wonderfully done by the way , which they used to introduce characters and to help the storytelling.Music : The battle music gets repetitive and so does the traveling music as I think they could 've done a better job in that department . The voice acting was done really well but the women 's voices do get a bit high pitched at times and it happens to the guys on occasion.The characters were developed nicely , each having their own background story which adds to your liking and caring about each of your character in your party . You can easily put 50+ hours in the game and also there are whats called Bromides to collect . Bromides are anime pictures in the game which you can collect throughout your travels-I believe there are 12 in all.Extras Disc : I watched it and enjoyed the voice actors and developers talking about how much fun they had making the game and what they did to add what they thought would help the game out.This game despite its old-school graphics and traditional fighting system gets a 5 out of 5 for its wonderful story and loveable characters .	1
Originally released back on the Sega Saturn , Working Designs ports it over to the Playstation , VERY NICELY . The original great game is here , with a few good enhancments . The best one being the Anime scenes . Very well done , and they help move the story along nicely . The game 's not up to par with the likes of most Final Fantasy games , or many other Square/Enix RPG 's , but it 's definitely a must have for any RPG fan.Gameplay : 8.1/10I 'll start with the battle system . The battles you run into to are n't random ; you can see them on the screen , and avoid some of them if you do n't want to battle . A lot of them are impossible to avoid , though ; this is needed , so you are n't just running through the game not fighting . You have the usual attack , run , and skills during the battles . When you have your character do a physical attack , he will move to the enemie he 's attacking and stay in that spot while the enemies do their attacks . Some of the enemy attacks will move your character a spot or two back . This way , there 's some strategy involved on the placement of your character . Each enemy has a certain amount of spots it can move , so if you want to stay away from some of them , do n't attack an enemy that 's surrounded by other enemies , because they all will be in attacking range , and they will all get a good attack in on you . A lot of the times , I did n't really worry about this , but it 's a little added strategy to the battles other than the usual fighting . One of the more useful ways of taking advantage of this , though , is to defend on one turn , let the enemies move close to you , and then hack and slash away . This way , you do n't move in without getting an attack on your enemy , and letting them attack you . Be smart , and you can avoid a hit here and there . The battles are turn based , by the way ; none of that meter stuff seen in most Final Fantasy games . Really either way is good to me.The way skills are learned in this game is just your basic learn a skill at a certain level system . Example : Learn a small healing spell at level 5 . There 's no custom way of learning your attacks . You have to realize , that this came out in the early 90 's , where there was only a game here and there had a deep system to go along with it . It gets the job done , but it 's not as advanced as some RPG'ers would like . I did n't mind , though . Do n't let this turn you away from the game . You will miss out on a memorable experience if you do.The areas in this game are big , good looking , and fun to work your way through . Your usual RPG stuff is here . Caves , Villages , Castles , etc . They offer up a good challenge , too , which you ca n't say about a lot of RPG 's out there . It 's not impossible by any means , but it 's not easy either . Good challenge . The world you travel through is well designed , and pretty big . As a whole , you wo n't find a bad or boring level in this game . It 's an expansive RPG world , with many fun challenges along the way.The characters are very good . They are pretty artistic . A couple basic looking ones , but overall , they have my pick as some of the better ones in an RPG , ever . The character development is not too bad , either . It 's not the best , but you should soon care for each character atleast a little . Especially the main ones like Alex , and Luna.I like the story a lot . You wont find a deep , complex plot . You get a straight-foward , hero defeating the villian , type of story . There 's a good surprise here and there , but not many . You will grow to hate the villians , and the story , while not being too complex , pulls you in and does n't let you go until you finish the game . I guarantee you will enjoy it.I take off the 1.9 because the battle system can get repetitive near the end of the game . The boss battles have you basically using the same spell per character each turn , hoping you have enough left to finish him off . This makes the usual fun boss fights , a little less fun than normal . Atleast they 're challenging , though , since they always have the same level as your characters . I did n't take off any more for the semi-basic storyline , and not so deep skill learning system because of the time it came out . That 's something you have to realize when playing this game : it was one of the best for it 's time.Replay Value : 6.5/10As with a lot of RPG 's , it 's not very good . I , and many will play through again for the positives I mentioned above , but there 's really no incentive to come back and play through the 25+ hour quest again . Only for the hardcore RPGer , I guess.Music : 8.2/10Overall , some very nice tunes scattered through out the game . It 's not mind blowing like some of the Square soundtracks , but it 's a good one . You will enjoy it for the most part , I know I did.Graphics : 9/10I 'm basing it on the year it came out . The levels , and battle graphics look stunning . With that said , though , the characters suffered and look pretty bland . That 's the reason for the 1 point off . Not a major problem at all , though . Especially when you play this one for the gameplay , like all RPG's.Overall : ( Not an average ) 8.5/10For it 's time , it offered a fun battle system , great graphics , a good story , and clever , fun level design . One of the best games in the genre at the time , and rightfully so . It has taken a slight hit over the years , but overall , it has stood the test of time pretty well . RPG fans would be wise to not miss out on this . With the special package one , you get tons of extra goodies ; well worth the money , although it 's only possible to find it on sites like Ebay . If you find it , go for it . You will not be disappointed in the slightest at this classic RPG.I recommend Lunar 2 as well . It improves upon this game in almost every way .	1
Lunar silver star story complete is the best remake ever ! Blows away the original in every possible aspect , from graphics to story.+ one of the best 2d graphics ever , everything is crisp and detailed with great anime sequence+ new soundtrack is great , the only song boat blow me away+one of the best cast of characters ever+ a great story reworked , a great improvment over the original+ no random battle+ the battle are pretty difficult ( specially the boss battle ) + voice acting is good+ new extras+ great package- the gamplay is on the simple side- again a little sidequestsnow , my classification of the first lunar versions.lunar silver star story complete ( ps ) 10/10 masterpiece ! lunar silver star harmony ( psp ) 8/10 downgraded version of the playstation masterpiecelunar the silver star ( sega cd ) 7/10 good.. but very obsolete , overshadowed by silver star storylunar legend ( gba ) 0/10 pure garbage	1
I 'm a little late in reviews since I played its GBA remake Lunar Legend first . ( I luckily got this game in trade from my local Game Express ) Well anyway from the other reviews you know the basicsMusic and Sound-5This music rocks I especially like the final battle theme Go ! Go ! Go ! Graphics-4.5Very nice ( since being a Playstation game the areas can be more exspansive than the tiny GBA thus allowing anime cut-scenes and more free roaming through places , but the GBA is nothing to be scoffed at having better sprites and brighter colors ) Storyline-5Very good stroyline ( I 'm kinda surprised since I usually hate love stories ) The story is as soild as this game can get . And unlike SOME RPGs *coughfinalfatasycough* You wo n't get bored and say `` Oh please '' at a useless plot twist that just makes you lose intrest in the game.Well now let 's see if I can test my luck and find Lunar 2 : Eteranl Blue ( Or maybe , hopefully they 'll just remake it for the GBA and call it Lunar Legend 2 ) Coolest Charcter-TempestFav Character- All of 'em especially Nash , Kyle Alex , Jessica and TempestFav music fron game- `` Go ! Go ! Go ! `` , `` Solitary Wolf '' , `` Fighting Spirits '' , Magical Weapon Nash '' , `` It 's Me '' `` Modern Boy '' and `` Mia 's theme '' ( forgot name )	1
If you 've played the original Lunar for Sega CD , I need only say : & quot ; Buy this collector 's edition now ! & quot ; For those of you who are unfamiliar with Lunar , it 's a classic old school RPG with 2D graphics and turn based battles . There are some differences between the Sega CD version and the Playstation one though . The graphics and color have recieved a noticable face lift , some areas have been edited or cut altogether , and a few items have also been left out . The music ( a prime feature in the Sega CD version ) has been reworked also , sometimes for the better , sometimes for the worse . Another new feature is how you encounter enemies . You no longer are forced into random battles ... enemies are now only in dungeons and can be seen by icons and therefore avoided in many cases . Overall , this a great package even if the price tag is high . The music CD and the documentary disc are nothing monumental , but fans will appreciate it . If you have not played Lunar before and are a fan of RPGs , get this Playstation version while it 's still available and find out why it created a cult following on the Sega CD .	1
i love this game and series , i shortly ordered the 2nd complete copy as well . it has treated me well with a wonderful story and great characters . i recommend this game and franchise to all my friends and fellow gamers .	1
This is one of the best games ever to come out on a console system ! The characters , the anime 's , and the simple and easy to learn battle system . There are many anime sequences with dialouge , and they are FUNNY . The battle system is a simple turn based combat which can be very amusing . The plot is great but the graphics are old saturn style but still rock . This game is worth your money .	1
I thoroughly enjoyed this game ! The packaging and extras you get with it are very nice . The storyline was extremely well written , and it was easy for me to connect with the characters on an emotional level . The music in this game is some of the best I have ever heard for an RPG . Definitely a good buy !	1
Honestly I miss RPGs like Lunar , now days most RPGs like the newer Final Fantasies feature a story that is too complicated and sometimes weird to thoroughly enjoy . Lunar keeps in simple , by making the story a tried and true good versus evil story , and by doing an excellant job on developing the charectors within the game . I guess its simplicity could be the downside for some gamers , but I personally enjoy a great old school RPG like Lunar from time to time .	1
I found the lack of polygons and elaborate battle techniques a blessing in the Silver Star Story ! I 'd rather see a realistic cartoon than an annoying , jerky 3-D anytime . The music is beautiful and I 'd catch myself humming the opening theme occasionally at work . The anime artwork in some of the scenes is breathtaking and the storyline is engaging . I am looking forward to the sequel which will be coming out around the 29th of November .	1
This is an all-time classic game . I have played more puzzle games than I can count in my head and this game has by far the best puzzles of them all . The graphics , sound , and interaction of this game are stunning . The way that you have to collect information from every available source to solve a puzzle makes the game extraordinary ( many puzzle games do not work that way ) .One aspect of the puzzles in this game that makes it different from many other games is that you can not guess to solve a puzzle . With many games , you can get past a tough point just buy clicking on every item in your inventory until you guess the right one . Eventually , you guess right , and you 're on to the next puzzle . In Myst , you must decipher them the old-fashioned way ! I agree with other reviewers , however , that this game has zero replayability . It should take you long enough though so that you wo n't feel like you did n't get your money 's worth .	1
This is the first PC game I ever bought . With it 's awesome graphics and compelling story , it 's easy to see why this is the top selling game of all-time . In it 's time , this game and The 7th Guest changed the way gaming was to be . Most point and click games you see today are following these 2 trend setting games , but it 's very hard for them to match up to what these games accomplished . It has some very tough puzzles and about the only lacking was there is n't much going on when you click on an area except for sound which is a key for most of the puzzles you will be solving . If you like point and click games with puzzles to solve , this is the game for you . A thoroughly enjoyable game that I have played close to a dozen times .	1
Ok , I have played Myst a good bit , so I can personally atest to the complexity of this game . I will half to admit , that I used the strategy guide a great deal to help me , because some parts were just impossible . First of all , you half to be extremely knowledgeable before you even attempt to play this game . There are things that i do n't even understand , and im not dumb . But the most difficult thing is tying together little pieces of the game to figure out one piece of the puzzle . I really like this game , and have yet to beat it . The music is haunting almost , and makes you feel like you are there , walking in a realistic 3D enviorment surrounded by things that you have no idea what they are , but will tie into the game as it progresses . There are also 5 completly diffrent & quot ; Ages & quot ; : Myst island , The Selentic Age , The Stoneship age , The Mechanical Age , and The Channelwood Age . This is a very complex and difficult , and i would warn anybody who play it to be ready for a good challenge .	1
This game is exellent . However I recommend buying the updated version & quot ; realMYST & quot ; . This version you ca n't pan around to gage your surroundings . They are both the same game , but the graphics in the updated realMYST is a vast improvement over this version .	1
There are very few video games from over 20 years ago that still go strong in the second decade of the 21st century . Myst is one of them . I remember playing this game back in 1993 and getting my but whipped with the puzzles . I recently replayed it and found myself in awe of how well constructed it is . Of course , graphics have advanced since 1993 , but Myst shows game developers how puzzles should really work.Unlike too many games today , Myst brilliantly evokes a sense of wonder and mystery . When you start the game , you 're just thrown into a new world with no explanation . You are left to explore and discover . There is a story with shocking twists , but the story depends upon your involvement and choices , not simply handed to you.The puzzles require a lot of time and thought . If you do n't like puzzles and thinking , do n't play this game . If you like challenges , Myst will challenge you . The puzzles often require you to make connections between separate pieces of information or view your environment in a new way . Some are frustrating and I did need to look at a hint guide a few times ( particularly for the Mechanical Age elevator ) but they all do have a logic.Unlike other reviewers , I found the one area Myst does n't hold up well is in building an immersive environment . Myst as a world does n't have a logic . There 's a spaceship , a boat , a clock tower , etc. , just sitting on the island . It seems more like a video game hub than an actual world . I think Myst makes up for its lack of internal logic by leaving so much mysterious and presenting you with such intricate puzzles that you want to explore the world.Overall , Myst was a historic computer game back in 1993 and is still worth playing 20 years later . From the early 1990s , I personally preferred Presto Studios ' Journeyman Project , which also had a compelling point-and-click adventure and featured pre-rendered 3D environments . However , until that game gets rereleased , Myst is easily the best point-and-click adventure readily out there.Note : the game is also available on iPhone , iPad , Nintendo 3DS , so there 's no excuse not to try it out .	1
One of the best adventure games ever ! Shame it 's for older computers and it makes me miss mine . If the gaming companies ever remake Myst for XP I 'd buy it again in a heartbeat .	1
Released back in 1995 , Myst is a classic game that revolutionized the gaming industry . Rand and Robyn Miller created a new type of game which diverted from the typical mass market and took off into a fascinating and innovative direction . It 's hailed as a landmark in the industry and praised for both its aesthetics and story.I think that Myst is best described as an experience rather than merely a video game . Its creators strived to develop a world rich with detail and intrigue , with a subtle narrative intertwined into the strange yet beautiful surroundings . As the game begins , you are dropped onto the island of Myst without very much information to guide you . What immediately strikes you as unique about this experience is that there are no friendly characters to help you on your way , no enemies to fight , and not a very clear purpose . The game is largely about just exploring your surroundings and experimenting with different devices around the various worlds . This is what makes the game so immersive . The graphics of Myst , though not quite as extravagant as today 's , were definitely of high quality . Cyan built its 3D world through an extensive layout of still images and QuickTime movies , and the end result is simply amazing . Navigation is node-based , meaning that you do n't necessarily walk through the environment but rather point and click your way through your surroundings . Each new section loads as if you really had relocated , giving the appearance of movement . Making a 3D world in this manner might seem strange , but at the time it was a necessary shortcut to make it possible to run the game on computers without a lot of RAM and processor power . Even by today 's standards , I still think the environments look impressive.So what exactly does the gameplay entail ? As you explore the island , you discover two journals with missing pages , each of which belong to Atrus 's sons , Sirrus and Achenar . Your main objective is to travel through the different worlds , or Ages , and retrieve the missing pages from each book . As you recover each page , you learn more about each brother , and you must try to discover who is lying and who is telling the truth . In the end , it will be up to you to decide their respective fates . Your journey is not easy , for you will have to solve rather challenging puzzles in order to progress throughout the worlds . This can often be frustrating , for the puzzles ' solutions are not always intuitive . It will take much patience and observation , and perhaps even a little help.The sounds in this game are mysterious and enchanting . The soundtrack consists of strange , sometimes haunting tunes that blend in remarkably well with each respective area . Moreover , the sounds are integral to the gameplay , for some of the puzzles involve listening in addition to seeing . You will need to observe and interpret different sounds and apply that information to the challenges you face . This is yet another way in which you can truly become immersed within the game . The music makes your surroundings feel foreign and believable.Myst was groundbreaking for its time , and it started an incredible journey that would spark several sequels . It 's an experience that is visually , musically , and intellectually stimulating , and though the game is a bit dated now , I still think it 's worth playing if you enjoy a good challenge . As many have mentioned , the ending is somewhat anticlimactic , but at the same time it will most likely make you want to continue the adventure with Riven .	1
& quot ; Myst & quot ; is the one that started it all . & quot ; Myst & quot ; is the game by which all other role-playing games are measured . No one had any idea when the game first came out in 1993 that it would eventually become the best-selling computer game of all time.Rand and Robyn Miller , the brothers who created the wildly successful game , hit upon a winning idea . Place someone into an unknown world where the clues he or she uncovers reveals the story . And one of the biggest perks of all - you ca n't die. & quot ; Myst & quot ; starts off by dumping you on a dock overlooking a vast ocean . You can hear water lapping along the dock , and a wind makes the hair on your neck stand up . And from there it only gets more interesting - you discover books that can link you to other worlds like this one , more commonly called Ages ; you encounter all sorts of devices that , even though they do n't appear to do much , are all part of the underlying thread tying the game together ; and just by wandering around you immerse yourself in the world that is & quot ; Myst. & quot ; Occasionally , I meet people who are baffled at the success of & quot ; Myst. & quot ; They do n't understand how a game where you just walk around and solve stuff can be so appealing . There is little or no character interaction , they say . I 've noticed that a lot of these same people are those who like those & quot ; shoot'em up and splatter their guts all over the wall & quot ; type of gamers . The reason & quot ; Myst & quot ; has been so successful is because it so pure - you do n't have to worry about dying , you use your head to get your way through things , and each new Age you encounter is just bursting with intriguing things to discover . That and each world is beautiful . Not as jaw-dropping as & quot ; Riven & quot ; and not nearly as mesmerizing as & quot ; Myst III : Exile & quot ; , but & quot ; Myst & quot ; has a subtle yet majestic beauty that makes it stand apart from other games.If you have never played a computer game before , give & quot ; Myst & quot ; a try . You will be surprised at how addictive it can become . Did I mention that there is no possible way in which you can be killed ? Seriously ! How many games today offer that ? There 's a reason why it has been such a hit ; millions and millions of people ca n't be wrong .	1
This game was fantastic ! Myst was the very first Adventure Game I played . That was 3 years ago . Ever since , I have been hooked on Adventure Games ! Myst made me feel like I was actually there . The puzzles were fantastic , rewarding , unique , and challenging . Play this game with the lights down and the music loud . You WILL be there ! I LOVE Myst as I did Riven and I cant wait to got back to ... .MYST III !	1
Here way before arrival date . Was a gift for my son and he loved it ! Will order from here again !	1
What 's amazing about how great this game is ... well , it 's that it does not rely on insane graphics , large amounts of memory , lightning-quick processing speeds , or mind-blowing sound.In fact , this game has none of those things.What it has is the ability to get right under your skin , suck you in , and keep you playing . What 's eerie is how much you feel like you 're in the game when the graphics really are n't much to speak of ( especially compared to today 's games ) .I played and finished this game back in 1995 . I own other game platforms ( PS2 , etc ) and I have played many other games since then . None of them is like this one .	1
I ca n't remember if Myst was my first PC game . I know it was the one that got me hooked -- to the point where I kept upgrading computers and peripherals just to keep up with the games . I tried to replay Myst a year ago and found I could n't figure it out ( have I lost that many brain cells over the years ? ) , did n't have the patience or something to keep at it . But like a first love , I remember it very fondly and treasure it . It 's almost heart breaking to think that some day soon , as Windows continues to do upgrade to different styles of OS , newbies wo n't be able to experience Myst . Just like so many young people will never know how it felt when rock'n'roll burst forth . To confess , I liked the graphics in Riven better . And I never liked Artus ( whatever ) or his two sons -- thought they were all slackers and whiners with serious emotional problems . I loved that you could not die and nothing attacked you -- really allowed [ me ] to explore and indulge my curiosity . Loved the details ( little bugs that moved , atmosphere , just everything ) . Sound effects and `` music '' -- was n't Myst one of the first to put visuals and music together ? All in all , many good things started with Myst . I know it was the first computer game that spent time and money on the graphics ( something I always appreciated ) . At most places , the game play was n't strictly linear so you could play in whatever order you wanted . You could `` spin '' around and see everything . It was totally mouse driven . One feature I loved ( but many others complained about ) was that it was an empty world , you never had to/got to interact with anyone else in Myst ; for me it was somewhere of my own where I could explore to my heart 's content , go back and walk around areas that I liked ( like `` tree '' world ( ca n't remember it 's actual name ) even after you finished that level . It is an all 'round beautiful game .	1
Although the technology behind this game is a little dated now , this is still an excellent puzzler for those who like games that do n't involve shooting monsters . Do n't get me wrong , I enjoy blowing away bad guys as much as anyone else , but it 's nice to play something a little different every once in a while . This game does not depend at all on weapons or killing anything , nor does it require you to do a lot of jumping or physically manuvering around obstacles . It is entirely a & quot ; thinking & quot ; game . The closest you get to physical action is the fact that some of the puzzles to solve are mazes.You start the game stranded alone on the Island of Myst , with no idea how you got there , and no idea how to get home . Your only clue is a note found on the ground near the island 's library . From this slender beginning , you learn about the history of the island , about Altus and his two feuding sons , Sirrus and Achernar , and the four mysterious Ages you must visit and explore . Be sure and explore the Library thoroughly . Check everything . The books in the library contain important clues . They are not strictly necessary to solve the game , but they help out a lot , especially the Mechanical Age ( with the rocket ship ) . Personally , I found the Channelwood Age the most difficult , but all of the Ages can be solved with a little logic , and thorough exploration . Each Age is also filled with little trinkets and gadgets that do n't really help you solve the game , but they reveal a LOT about the personalities of Sirrus and Achernar.Visually , the game is absolutely gorgeous . Each Age has an entirely different look and feel to it . The user interface is extremely simple and intuitive . The haunting soundtrack and well-done QuickTime animations also add a lot to the overall feel of the game.The only people you will actually interact with at all in the game are the aforementioned Altus , Sirrus , and Achernar . This leads me to my one and only complaint about the game . I wish the Millers had spent a little more money to hire some better actors to play these roles , as all three of them are badly overacted . But , that 's a minor gripe . Altus ' acting is so bad , it 's actually funny.Once you 've played through this game a couple of times , it becomes pretty easy . However , I still maintain that the game does have a lot of replay value . Why ? Becuase once you have figured everything out and memorized the solutions to all the puzzles , you can get to the end in about 3 or 4 hours , tops . But that 3 or 4 hours is time well spent immersed in the game 's beautiful environment.I 've noticed several people who have mentioned that the game does not run well on Windows 98 . I 've encountered this problem too . If you install the game from the automatic installation dialog box that comes up when you insert the Myst CD , the game will play OK for a little while , but will eventually crash . However , I was able to find a solution . If you 're running Windows 98 or newer , do NOT install from the dialog box . Instead , go to the Install subdirectory on the CD , find the & quot ; install.exe & quot ; file there , and click on it to install the game that way . The installation procedure is slightly different . You 'll know you are doing it the different way when the game installes to a new directory called c : \myst . If you use the automatic dialog box , it will install to a different subdirectory . I installed the game using this alternate procedure , and it has been running fine with Windows 98 . I hope this helps anyone out there experiencing problems . It would be a shame to miss out on a game as good as this one becuase of operating system problems .	1
The hit 1990s game `` Myst '' set off the immensely popular `` Myst '' series , as well as `` Myst '' spin-off computer games . The game is fantasy-based , puzzle game , incorporating unique locations and mechanical motifs . While a bit outdated in some ways , the game is intriguing and fun and well worth buying.-PlotYou play a character who finds themselves stranded on a tiny island . While exploring , you begin to discover the dark past of the island which you are visiting . Using ingenious `` linking books '' you can access other islands and unravel the truth behind the lonely , mysterious worlds.-EnvironmentThe environments , while not necessarily beautiful , are well done . There are a total of five islands , all with different motifs . These islands , or `` ages '' include : -A world with half-sunken boats and flooded tunnels.-An age with a spinning building.-A Cyprus forest with a network of treehouses.-An odd , out-of-this world island with a gigantic tunnel.The environments can be rather dark at times . In general there is little character interaction , leaving the player dealing mostly with puzzles and exploring.Music drifts in and out of the game , with some locations dominated by the sound of wind while others have music in the background . The music alternates between very dark to dark tinged . While the game does not have catchy tunes , it suits the game quite well as background music.-CharactersThere are few characters , and interaction is limited . There is a selection of journals in a library which provide interesting reading and histories of the various islands.-PuzzlesThis game is a puzzle game . The puzzles are generally mechanical in nature . The puzzle solutions can be illusive , but puzzles are generally not incredibly tedious . Once you have solved puzzles once , they can generally be solved again quickly , allowing you to replay the game without worrying about coming to mounds of impossible puzzles yet again.If you enjoy puzzles that involve common sense more than mathematics and like interesting and unique worlds , you will enjoy `` Myst . '' The game has decent replay value . The game is rather old , and an updated edition called `` Real Myst '' is available on Amazon . However , for a genuine piece of gaming history , the original is the way to go .	1
This Game is a good game depending on your personality . If you like to drive around in a car in New York City or shooting up alien invaders , in other words you like games with a lot of action , then this is probably not the game for you . there is no action , or enemies . Myst is more of exploring and puzzle solving . It requires quite a bit of patience to play . If your looking for an adventure/puzzle game then you should get myst . in my opinion it is a great game . one of the best i have ever played	1
Myst is an awesome game of puzzle solving and exploration . What 's nice about Myst is that it is completely violence-free and peaceful . This is a must have !	1
There are very experiences in this world that are completely original . In terms of adventure PC gaming , however , `` Myst '' is utterly without equal and ( if you are the right kind of person ) will quickly become one of the most endearing experiences of all your entertainment pastimes.Before `` Myst '' , computer gaming usually was in the form of either first-person shooters ( `` Wolfenstein '' ) , adventures aimed more towards children ( `` Kings Quest '' ) , and the tons and tons of shareware/pong/simulator games that flooded the market in the early-to-mid 1990s . In `` Myst '' , though , gamers are simple dropped into an environment where little to no information is given to them , thus requiring much exploring and a logical mind to determine not only the overall point of the game , but also how all the levers and puzzles work in conjunction with each other.For a basic plot summary , you ( `` the Stranger '' ) suddenly appear in a universe where a man named Atrus can pen books that actually spring to life . However , many of his worlds are dying/unstable and you must determine the cause . Is it Atrus himself who has gone mad and imprisoned his sons in his own prison books , or are the sons locked away for good reason ? The `` Stranger '' must explore a series of five islands and piece together the mystery one puzzle and logical deduction at a time.This Myst series is not for everyone , by any means . If you are a bit lacking in patience and want a lot of action , this is not the game for you . It can get a bit tedious at times and one has to resist ( especially nowadays when walk-throughs are available with a few mouse clicks ) the urge to look up hints all the time ( as that truly destroys the beauty of the experience ) , so if you want to be blasting baddies or wreaking war/havoc , look elsewhere are the risk of severe disappointment.For those who really appreciate this kind of `` thinking-person 's '' game , `` Myst '' is unrivaled ( and I have tried MANY of its subsequent clones ) in the industry because of its riveting storyline . A lot of other games have tried to duplicate the `` puzzling '' style of `` Myst '' , but only `` Myst '' has been able to successfully capture the emotion of compelling characters that never seem to get old.Overall , I consider `` Myst '' to be one of my all-time favorite PC games because of its groundbreaking intuitive style . In hindsight , at least two of its sequels surpass this original , but `` Myst '' is always special because it set the groundwork for the master series . If you want your brain/wits to be more involved in a PC game than your trigger finger , then I strongly recommend `` Myst '' if you have n't tried it to this point . If you can let yourself become immersed in its worlds , you will get hooked !	1
This will be short . Simply put , Riven is my all time favorite game . The story is deep . The graphics are excellent . I was fully absorbed . If they could create a game with graphics like these in real time 3d - could you imagine . It 's a great game .	1
I hold a deep affection for this game . My brother bought it for Playstation on a whim , having never either played or heard of Myst ( I still have n't played it ) , and I played the game alongside him , both of us consulting the walkthrough the whole time ( something I now do not condone , but we were young - what do you expect ? ) , and thoroughly enjoying it . We had hours of fun playing it over and over , memorizing the steps , the scenes , and every instance of the number 5.This game started my love for everything Myst related , and made me realize that I can play video games too . Until seeing this game , I thought that all video games required finger dexterity and quick reflexes , neither of which do I have.Sure , it may not be the best as far as graphics when compared to newer games , and may not have the three-dimensionality of subsequent Myst games and many newer games , but it still holds a magical quality and the storyline ca n't be beat . This game is a true classic , and everyone who plays adventure games should play it . As far as storyline and puzzles go , this is what adventure games should be .	1
I ca n't recommend this game enough . You walk away smarter.If you like a game with a lot of action forget it . If you like to feel like you accomplished something , this is the game for you.It 's predecessor Myst was excellent preparation for the type of game this is . There is no & quot ; Action & quot ; per se , just clues and objects to work through . You do n't get killed , you do n't get points . You do however get an appreciation for how intricate details can be interlinked.Imagine that you end up in a land , where you have to put together the pieces to figure out what happened . This is both Myst and Riven.If you play Myst first , it will help you understand what this is all about . I recommend it highly . It will give you a sense of what you are looking for and why . Myst was a land where you realized that two brothers had done something and were trapped in books for their efforts . Their father and mother also were elsewhere and looking for one another and had left clues in this same area . Your assignment is to piece together , what happened and use your gut feel on how to act in regards to that . There are in fact 4 possible endings to Myst.In my opinion and from what I have seen at home , unless you have a very analytical child , this will not hold their interest . This is an adult game and not from the perspective that you are protecting the child . I honestly think this would be an excellent assignment for a child to hone their thought processes on . However the lack of action and need for real thinking most children will think of as work , not fun.Put on your thinking caps and dive in.I 'm waiting for the next one .	1
Riven is a worthy followup to Myst and still must rate as one of the alltime great adventure games.Those familiar with the Myst series will know some of what to expect : lush visuals ( although in static form , no 360 rendering ) , a detailed storyline , fiendishly clever puzzles , much mysterious machinery , and a need to respond to and interact with the environment in order to solve the game.There are some important differences to the Myst series . First of all , rather than exploring a number of different worlds , or 'ages ' , in Riven you explore one ( albeit large ) world , comprised of five islands . There are links to two other 'ages ' but these are very sketchily developed and there is not much to explore here . There are some differences between the islands , but the radically different tones of the ages in Myst or Myst III is missing.This has its advantages and disadvantages . The world you explore is much larger , and you can progress over virtually the whole world without needing to solve many puzzles , allowing even a casual player a good glimpse at the world of Riven.However , it also means that the puzzles are less contained and linear than in the other Myst games . As well as a number of smaller puzzles , there are two major puzzles to be solved , clues for which are scattered throughout the islands . Even with the smaller puzzles , the control to open a vital door might be located a long distance away , or only accessible via a very circuitous route . This can add another degree of complexity to the puzzles . Having said that , there is a degree of logic to most of the controls which are based on the culture and lifestyle of the inhabitants of Riven . The puzzles generally also operate in a logical manner and relate well to the entire environment of the game.There is little action for the punch-em-up enthusiasts - but they 're unlikely to be reading the review anyway.In summary , a fantastic game that will engross you for hours - I just wish more alternative ages could have been included .	1
I tell you this , the creators of Riven sure did their homework in the four year gap between the original Myst and Riven . The graphic improved drastically , meaning whatever computer you were running the original Myst in '93/'94 ( Myst first appeared on the Mac in '93 , then the PC the following year ) would probably not be adequate to run Riven . Certainly Myst had made even greater improvements in the graphics department since Riven , like the 360 degree panning feature for Myst III : Exile , and even more photo-realistic graphics and animation for Myst IV : Revelation , but even for 1997 standards the graphics to Riven still hold up , although it 's rather obvious the graphics looks a little more pixelated during some of the animated scenes ( like when you take a ride on the cable car , probably to keep the animation fast without slowing it down for the computers of the time ) . But for the most part , the graphics seem so realistic you almost feel like you 're there . Of course the big pain is this game consisted of 5 CD-ROM discs , which you have to swap every now and then , it 's too bad they did n't have an install feature where you could install all five discs on to hard drive and only need to use one disc to play the game ( like the much maligned Schizm : Mysterious Journey , a game from Poland that 's very much like Myst , which had five discs in the CD-ROM version , and you had the option for full install so you did n't have to keep swapping discs ) .It 's agreed by most everyone that Riven is more difficult to solve than the original Myst . The puzzles often do n't seem obvious , and there are some puzzles that can be frustrating , like the marble puzzle , which you have to solve in order to gain access to the domes found on Riven . Or the animal puzzle , which you 'll find a bunch of stones in this one room with animal symbols that you have to push in the right order to go to another world . On the original Myst , after you won it , Atrus tells you that his wife Catherine has been taken prisoner , and on Riven , you 're supposed to find and free his wife , taken prisoner by Atrus ' father , Gehn . Also it looks like a different guy was playing Atrus on Riven from the original Myst , in fact it was none other than Myst creator Rand Miller who plays Atrus on Riven ( as well as Myst III and IV , though I had n't played Myst V , so I ca n't tell you about the game or the characters ) , although I 'm uncertain who played Atrus on the original Myst . I really love the ambient music that goes with this , not to mention the beautiful scenery found throughout.Although a bit tricky in places , you 're certain to enjoy this game if you 're in to Myst .	1
Though I did n't think it would be possible without adding real pictures , the graphics on Riven exceed those of Myst . Every scene is elaboratly detailed and very pleasing to the eye . The sounds and music are much better and sound even more realistic . They also have added more animation . You see more things moving around that makes it seem like you are more involved in the game . They have also added some very cool features such as a roller coaster type vehicle that lets you travel from island to island and a submarine used to travel underwater . The game play is much the same as Myst , but sometimes you have to go to one area and do some things to complete a puzzle in another area . You also have to learn the Riven math system to solve other puzzles which I thought was a cool idea . Ultimately , all these things add up to tougher game play , but this game is well worth it .	1
I just played it in April of 2002 and it stands up over time as the best adventure game ever made ! Superb .	1
Played it for the first time , after it has been out for over ten years . Great game . The puzzles are hard , but not impossible to solve . If you truly love Myst , then you will certainly love this game . ( Do not use walkthroughs , it ruins the game ! ) Also , keep in mind that the 5-CD Riven set is for outdated computers . It will most likely not run on Vista or XP , at least not without some major glitches . Wish I had played this sooner .	1
If you think you are smart enough to finish every computer game in the world in a few days , think again.Riven is THE hardest computer game I have ever played . I know someone who got this game and it took him six months to finish it ! I myself have not finished it yet.If you get this game ( I strongly recommend that you should ) , you have got to turn off the lights , turn up the sound , and you 'll step into the strange world of Riven . It 's really cool.This game requires tons of brainwork . If you do n't think hard , you 'll never finish the game.So , I think you should get this game . The story is great , the graphics are great , hey , EVERYTHING is great ! ! !	1
Excellent . Sound story line , great graphics and challenging puzzles . Although I found I had to cheat just a little using the Universal Hint System on the Net . All in all it is well worth the purchase .	1
I hav n't played Myst yet , but I have completed this one . What an immersive game this is . Great graphics , great sound , great features to play with and great fantasy world . Riven might only be a small world , but it 's well worth the visit . You even get to see some alien creatures here and there . I give this 4 stars because the puzzles were a bit too hard for a lot of gamers . It took me 3 months in all , WITHOUT HINTS I might add . If you like fantasy , puzzles and exploration . GET IT . It 's worth it just for the graphics alone .	1
Once again you put your hand to the book , and enter another world ... this time , Riven , in an effort to find the wife of your host . Yes , it 's still basically a slide show , and yes , there really are n't any other people to interact with , but it 's still beautifully drawn , with gorgeous environments to explore , and atmospheric music to soothe you .	1
Given the success of Myst , a sequel was inevitable . Riven is both a sequel in spirit and in its story . The game takes place just after Myst and takes the player to another age where you meet Atrus ' father and wife , amongst others . As in Myst , the story is told through journal entries , puzzles , and a few cinematic scenes . Riven does develop the story more than Myst did , with more cinematic cutscenes and longer books . Overall , I think this is a great addition and the actor who plays Ghen ( Atrus ' father ) is actually quite good.Like Myst , Riven is a challenging puzzle game . Overall , the game is n't quite as challenging as Myst because the relationship between the puzzles and solutions are n't as attenuated . However , there are a few cases where I felt like I knew what information I needed , but did n't know where to find it . This is particularly problematic in a point-and-click game with limited movement . I was particularly frustrated with learning the Riven numbers - I knew I needed to in order to learn a code , but could n't figure out where to get the translation ! Also , there is one thing in the very last puzzle which is a real pain - something impossible to see that needs to be moved.The graphics in Riven look beautiful , even 15 years later . The Riven environment is gorgeous and has some really startling landscape . However , the geography in Riven is supposedly 5 times larger than Myst 's , but because most of the game occurs within a single Age is actually does feel a bit smaller . Moreover , I felt like there were more `` corridors '' , or areas that had no function other than to serve as space between two other areas . Myst by contrast was extremely compact . I 'm not sure which is better , but I 'd guess that in terms of puzzle content the two games were about equal . I would have preferred a bit more environment and fewer corridors.Ultimately , Riven is a worthy sequel to Myst and follows its predecessor closely . If you like Myst , you 'll probably love Riven . If not , Riven probably does n't offer anything new to change your mind . Recommended .	1
Wow , I loved Myst when it first came out but Riven far exceeded my expectations . Gorgeous graphics , hours of gameplay with mind bending , challenging puzzles . A must have for adventure gamers and collectors . A classic to not miss out on . There are hidden clues throughout the game , be open-minded , and try not to go to fast , you could miss a hidden path , or a clue . Your patience and hard thinking will pay off .	1
This game is great ! It 's not as good as Myst , but it 's still impressive . This games backs right up to Myst , so if you han n't played Myst , you will have NO idea on whats going on ! Somthing thats better the Myst , the grapics . I do n't know how good they are on PC because I 've got the playstation virsion , but the graphics on that are awsome ! My opinion on buying it or renting it is you should buy it if you 've played and BEATEN Myst . But Bloskbuster done n't carry this game .	1
Myst set the stage for dozens and dozens of adventure games , and with such an act to follow Cyan had a difficult time topping themselves . But amazingly , they did ... Riven picks up exactly where the Myst left off . You are in the chanber with Atrius and he sends you to Riven to try and trap his father and rescue his wife and the people of the land . Unfortunately the moment you arrive in Riven you have your trap book taken from you and embark on an island hopping trip to try and recover it and confront Gehn once and for all.The thing that makes Riven so beautiful is that there are living creatures around you now . You can walk around one corner and see a frightened group of villagers runing away from you and hiding , you can catch a child peeking out at you from around a corner , bugs crawl on the walls , and large sea mammals bask on rocks at the beach.Turn the lights off , crank the speakers up , and play riven ... you 'll find yourself lost in the world of puzzles , of frightened natives , politics ... and everything else . Myst was groundbreaking because it was so unique , and Riven is likewise because its ALIVE . Probably the most alive game I 've ever played .	1
Like the top and first reviewer said , this game is not for everyone . It is almost not a 'game ' at all . Everything is in first person as 'you ' are moving around the area talking to the very few people you encounter , some nice , some not . The visuals are STUNNING ! and the music is just as beautiful . I played many hours at a time and while a lot of the game is crazy difficult ( do n't get me started on the D'ni numbers ) it is still a lot of fun . Let me repeat : the puzzles in this game are HARD they are time consuming , and they seem not to make sense.This is NOT for everyone and only for people with a lot of patience and I would say , avid computer gamers , and avid computer games who can appreciate slow , methodical , thinking games that do offer entertainment and beautiful graphics and music . There is some violence and character interaction , but this is by far no `` Halo '' `` Resident Evil '' or `` Gears of War '' . I must say the first time I played I got very far , but then got lost and had to buy a game guide . When I went back to it later I could not figure anything out and got nowhere fast , you do n't care about that but I 'm baffled I was so lost the SECOND time playing . Anyway , Riven is an old game , but the graphics hold up . If you can get it cheap , go for it . I will say do not be fooled by a look-alike game `` Rhem '' it is Riven-lite and hardly worth your time . I will also say that even if you are so confused you do n't understand anything you 're doing or what the story is I still think you 'll be entertaining . It is really a cool game to play .	1
This game actually stands up to the test of time , as opposed to Myst part one 's antiquated technology , and ancient graphics ... Unfortunately , I never got to play these games when they came first came out , and being spoiled with all the improvements in the visual department over the years , had to start with Riven instead of Myst . The game is probally the largest and most meticulous effort of all 5 games , simply for being a little larger and a little more designed then many of the future under-developed , but beautiful lands Myst would take us to..Obviously this game is for a certain type of `` quiet '' gamer , who prefers exploration and figuring out how to work a puzzle out over visceral , button mashing action..If those attributes do intriuge you as a gamer however , there is no better place and example to start with then the legendary Myst series..	1
I enjoyed Riven more than Myst . Riven was more difficult than Myst , for me , but I still only needed two hints to complete Riven . I would highly recommend Riven to adventure gamers . It really has set a new standard for the genre . Have n't played Exile yet , but I wanted to complete Riven before moving on to # 3 . What these Cyan games possess - far above any other adventure games I 've played - are smart , subtle story lines that really keep your attention . How refreshing to play a game that respects the player 's intelligence and sense of inquisitiveness and adventure . I know I 'm hooked when I think about a game throughout my day . Riven does become your world . Finally , like Tolkien 's 'The Lord of the Rings , ' the Myst games possess subtle yet compelling Christian symbols - a spiritually fulfilling experience .	1
& quot ; Riven & quot ; is a continuation of the popular role-playing game , & quot ; Myst. & quot ; I did n't think it could outdo its predecessor , as most sequels are never able to quite live up to the original . But & quot ; Riven & quot ; more than met that task . In fact , & quot ; Riven & quot ; so surpasses & quot ; Myst & quot ; in scope , storyline and task that it 's almost boggling.The game opens with you returning to D'Ni again after transporting through the linking book in the Library on Myst Island . The ever-knowledgeable Atrus , played by Rand Miller , thanks you for coming back and says he needs your help . And from then the race is on : You need to find his wife Catherine who is trapped in a prison somewhere on the Riven Age . Her captor turns out to be Atrus ' father , Gehn , a madman who wants to destroy his own son . Along the way , you encounter people , puzzles , awesome creatures ( like Sunners and Wahrks ) , and dazzling special effects.Just like on Myst Island , the clues you discover on the five islands in Riven are what reveal the story to you . & quot ; Riven & quot ; is increasingly more complex than & quot ; Myst & quot ; in that regard . Everything is just bigger and , in my opinion , better . The graphics have improved tremendously ; the Quicktime videos used for all the animations in the game are improved ; the puzzles are harder and are more integrated into the storyline than ever before ; and there is actually character interaction in this game - much more so than simply meeting people through Prison Books , like in & quot ; Myst. & quot ; & quot ; Riven & quot ; is definitely habit-forming . The first time I played it , I ended up just walking around and looking at everything before I decided to actually begin my journey on rescuing Catherine . When you step out into the open a few minutes after the real action begins , the sense of & quot ; this is gon na be bigger and more immersive than Myst & quot ; sets in.I can not say enough positive things about & quot ; Riven. & quot ; I end up playing it more than & quot ; Myst & quot ; and have sometimes preferred it over & quot ; Myst III : Exile. & quot ; To say I am fascinated with everything on those five islands is an understatement . I sometimes with I could actually go to the Riven Age and explore ; that 's how seriously disturbed I really am ! In short , if you love the & quot ; Myst Phenomenon , & quot ; get & quot ; Riven. & quot ; & quot ; Riven & quot ; improves upon pretty much everything that made & quot ; Myst & quot ; such an awesome success . Let it capture your heart and your imagination like it did mine .	1
This is an older game with great graphics and sound , but it will not run on Windows 7 . It does run on Windows XP and older versions of Windows . I had this game years ago but the discs were scratched from being used so much , so I bought a new set and am enjoying it all over again . However , if you purchase this game , it is so hard to solve , you will probably need to buy the user 's guide .	1
I really loved Riven . After playing Myst , I was so excited to get my hands on Riven . The graphics were just as beautiful as Myst . In fact , in Riven , I got a little jumpy at times . There are parts of the game where you know you arent alone . The story line was fantastic and the puzzles also . Adventure gamers , you have got to own this one . Infact ... own them both . You wont regret it .	1
This is by far my favorite out of the Myst series . Before I knew better , I cheated to get to the ending , looking at walkthroughs . Unfortunately , it 's not like you can 'undo ' that memory in your head , and I 've forever ruined the game in my eyes . The two biggie puzzles in this game involve clues from the whole game you 've explored up to that point . I wish I had taken the time to fully appreciate their solution and not cheat .	1
I just purchase this game a few weeks ago . It was the first that I played anything related to Myst . This is is user friendly , unlike other games where you have to fumble over the keyboard controls.Beautiful landscapes and exciting roller coaster like transports from one island to another makes this game enjoyable and exciting.Clever puzzles are disguised as Riven 's natural habitat.This is a slow pace game not for those who like face-paced game . As always , this game is fustrating and after a while , you might get tired with it ... But the absorbing story line and the landscapes should will make you forget all that , and you might never want to leave Riven , even after you completed Riven many times ...	1
First of all , I would like to point out that I did not play Myst , the first game in the series . I at first was afraid that I would be left confused and in the dark , but the game explains everything you need to know . What I 'm trying to say is that , you do n't HAVE to have played Myst before Riven ( though I suggest it strongly ) .The game 's graphics , first of all , are impossibly real . Everything looks almost like a photograph , from the stone cliffs , to the iron railings on the stairs , to the various transportation rides around the age of Riven.The game is a puzzle game ; it is not easy . It is not the kind of game you will sit down at and simply beat . It took me at least six hours without the strategy guide . Just for reference , if one goes through the game and does the ABSOLUTE minimum , i.e . already knows some of the codes and knows exactly what to do when and where , the game will still take about and hour and a half.The gameplay itself , aside from being beautiful and challenging is an extremely easy to use , idiot proof interface of `` click where you want to go . '' The game is a masterpiece , what more can I say ?	1
Riven is a worthy sequel to Myst , and takes the Myst & quot ; mystique & quot ; to another level with five new worlds and an expanded story line . The brilliantly realized environments and mood-setting soundtrack draw you in immediately and keep you there until the sun comes up . Riven is not for gamers with short attention spans -- simply navigating and charting the accessible areas of the Age of Riven take patience and time , and solving what I would characterize as the two major puzzles requires all of the intelligence and tenacity one can muster . As some reviewers have said , having played Myst first is helpful background to have , but this is not because the puzzles of Riven are similar to those of Myst , but because Myst will acquaint you with how the creators conceive puzzles , and heighten your sensitivity to factors in the environment that bear noting and investigating . I gave Riven 4 stars , rather than 5 , for two reasons : ( a ) one of the major puzzles is sound-based , and after some long and frustrating efforts at solving it on my own , I obtained some hints on the internet and found that the solution required matching up particular sounds from the game that , in fact , simply did not match up ( at least not in the version that I bought ) ; and ( b ) one other crucial clue is a tiny , blurry image . In these respects , I felt that the creators did not play fair . Two other points : ( i ) contrary to what some have said , it is indeed possible to lose this game and meet an untimely end , so be careful out there , and ( ii ) recognize that the CD-Rom version is on 5 discs , which need to be changed every time you travel from one world to another -- if you have a DVD-Rom player , by all means spring for the DVD version , which consists of one disc .	1
Pros:1 . Graphics that are fantastically detailed , intricate , and achingly beautiful . Some astonishing joy rides . Sound effects and music approach perfection.2 . Gameplay is wonderfully balanced . You are never bored , and only occasionally frustrated by the harder puzzles . All the puzzles are logical , and give you a great feeling of accomplishment when you solve them . There is a vast area to explore while you are figuring things out . You turn a corner , and startle mysterious creatures who are sunning themselves on a rock . You climb up another path , turn , and the view makes you gasp.3 . Riven creates a fantasy world that is alien ; yet it evokes a sense of reality that is , in my experience , unparalleled in computer gaming . I wish I could find a way to live in Riven.Cons:1 . If you like exploring new worlds by dashing through them and shooting things , you may find that the pace of this particular game is too slow.2 . While the storyline is intriguing , it is possible to nearly finish Riven before discovering the diaries that further explain the plot . I wish I had known more of the background of the story a little sooner in the game.3 . Riven is so immersive that you forget the everyday world . Your children will wonder why you have n't cooked dinner . Your friends will speculate as to why you have stopped answering the phone . Your spouse will become jealous of your relationship with a computer game ( easiest solution : play it together ) .Bottom Line : IMHO , this game is IT , the Numero Uno , the King . Nobody 's made one better .	1
I admittedly played Myst and was frustrated with it . I was so used to games giving you hints/directions so you knew where you had to go to progress the story . Myst broke that boundary and let you `` explore '' a world . I never finished it and only got maybe 30-35 % through it before I stopped playing.When Riven came out , I initially brushed it off harking back to my Myst experience . Good reviews and in game screenshots of these lavish environments and devices made me want to try it , and I was not disappointed.Riven ( at the time it was released ) was the only game where I played the entire night , keeping a scratch pad next to my mouse so I could notate things I 'd find ( designs , shapes , items , even sounds as the guy at Ebgames said he recommended to ) . While still difficult in terms of puzzles and solving them , I found it easier to progress the story and move into the different time periods.There is a part where you need to remember particular sounds and replay them in order so you can proceed . This took me forever ! I could n't get it right even though I thought I remembered it . It truly tests your mind . Getting by that particular puzzle was very gratifying.In short , if you 've played Myst ( or even its sequels after Riven ) , give this one a shot . You will not be disappointed .	1
After the success of the original `` Myst '' game changed the landscape of computer gaming , its widely-awaited sequel created an even more engaging atmosphere . The only trouble ? It is difficult to the point of giving up on far too many occasions.Basically , `` Riven '' follows the same point-and-click philosophy as its predecessor . You go around solving logic puzzles with the goal of saving Catherine ( wife of age-writer Atrus ) from the murderous Gehn.In terms of overall imagination and scope , `` Riven '' is , dare I say , easily the `` best '' of the Myst bunch . The puzzles are more engaging than `` Myst '' , and the game just has an epic feel to it . Every single different island , creature , or pathway one encounters in the game leads to an amazing discovery . At least at the outset , it is almost impossible to not get swept away by the atmosphere and become completely immersed in the gameplay.The problem ? Here it is : After playing all the Myst games through as a teenager when they first came out , I decided to tackle them all again and review them on Amazon this time . `` Myst '' was a grand experience , and so was `` Riven '' ... until you actually have to begin solving the the mystery of the Golden Domes ( which leads in turn to the infuriating dot-matrix puzzle ) . The difficulty level gets to the point where one most devote countless hours ( and probably even some sleepless nights ! ) to wrapping one 's brain around the mysteries . Unless you are fully , 100 % committed to the game , you will waver at this point.An easy `` fix '' for the difficulty problem would have been having the islands be a bit more accessible . Whereas in `` Myst '' the action took place in relatively enclosed spaces , `` Riven '' sprawls out over and incredibly large environment . Thus , a `` discovery '' on one island is prompted not only by the thought of `` I know what this does now '' , but also `` how the heck do I get back there ? ! '' . Not having to spend valuable time traipsing across the entire game would have ratcheted up the experience quite a bit ( instead of dragging it down considerably ) .Finally , it is sad that ( despite its shortcomings ) this game has not received a stable release on current software platforms . Despite downgrading my QuickTime and trying any number of `` compatibility '' fixes , `` Riven '' would not run on Windows 7 without freezing up approximately every 10-15 minutes of gameplay . I 'm not letting this issue affect my review of the actually gameplay itself , but just be warned that getting the game to work at all will be an out-and-out struggle.Overall , `` Riven '' is still a landmark PC that I truly hope gets an update for modern technology . It would be a shame to see such a fine game be relegated to the dustbin of history based only on outdated technology .	1
Ape Escape is on one of the sleekest action games on Playstation , which is , in theory , a pretty low-power console . The graphics , despite being rather choppy , are colorful and well-textured . Most of all , the game has a high frame rate with no noticeable slowdown to speak of , which allows things to move quickly and smoothly . The control scheme is intuitive despite being complex at the outset . Fortunately , no action you can take requires pressing more than one button . Right shoulder buttons are jumping , left shoulder buttons center camera and bring you into a first-person lookaround mode , digital d-pad moves the camera , left and right sticks move the character and the selected tool respectively , which the X , triangle , circle , and square buttons select your tool . Also , the controls are quite tight , which will save you much frustration from falling over cliffs and such . The camera is one of the best I 've ever seen . It rarely swings around the character , although at times I did experience a few odd , glitchy perspectives , such as from behind walls and from under floors . Fortunately , the camera is spring-loaded to auto-center on the character.The level selection is the usual cliche pretty meadows/volcanoes/robotic factory fare , but in order to fulfill your quota of monkeys ( capturing anachronistic , and very agile monkeys is the point of the game ) you will have to navigate your surroundings in all of the three dimensions and utilize all of your equipment ( monkeys are caught with a net , enemies are disposed of with a & quot ; force club & quot ; , you can glide with a hand copter to reach higher ground , or swim via help of a motorized sub ) , which is part of the appeal . The levels are large and complex.The game is relatively easy , but the frantic excitement it creates will make you play it over and over again .	1
I was bored one day , and was watching my mother-in-law play Ape Escape 2 . Looked like it was fun , and less stressful than some of my other games that I like tend to be , and borrowed her copy of the first Ape Escape.It starts out simple enough . You catch a few slow monkeys and learn your gadgets thru tutorials . But then it gets difficult . My 3 year old daughter loves to sit on the bed with spare control in hand and help catch monkeys . The graphics are nice and the storyline is fun . The gadgets are cool too.Only one complaint , and that is that the camera angle loves to change when you are at the most challenging parts . Anytime you need to use your flying thingy and it 's for going somewhere difficult , the camera changes and you ca n't see where your destination is . It gets a bit annoying after you die a few times , but I did eventually get past the frustration and finished the game . This game is great for young kids and adults alike .	1
I used to play the h*** out of this game when I was little and even more when I got older . Its one of those game thats old , but never got boring even when I played it multiple times . For those who are new to the series , you might think its just running up to monkeys and catching them with a net . You 're partially right . If you go into this game and try to catch every monkey by just running up to them with your net , you will get a game over fast . I own the other 2 games in the Ape Escape series and played them multiple times , so its safe for me to say that Ape Escape 1 is the hardest of the series . Let me go into a little more detail.A little background : I 'm not sure about other consoles at the time , but the PS1 , unlike todays Sony consoles , had a different control scheme . Instead of using the analogue sticks to move your camera and control your character , you used the arrow buttons . The analogue sticks did n't have much use . Actually with some games no use at all . In other games like Spyro the Dragon you had the option to turn them on , but for some of those games it was glitchy . Ape Escape prooved revolutionary in that it was the first PS1 game to solely use analogue controls and I 'm happy it did . I think Ape Escape is the best moving ps1 game I have ever played due to analogue controls . It makes controlling your character and changing camera angles way easier than most games at the time . Now all games use this control scheme for the better.Story summary : 2 boys , Spike and Jake , are heading to the Professor 's laboritory to try out his time machine , but once they get there they find the professor and his assistant/granddaughter Natalie tied up by a horde of monkeys . The monkeys leader ( Spector ) has gotten hold of one of the professors inventions called the peak point helmet which increases Spectors intellegents and helps him achieve an insane level of power . The other monkeys possess Monkey helmets that do pretty much the same thing as Spectors helmet , but less powerful . Spctor sends himself and the other monkeys through time so they can change history in a way that 'll make monkeys the dominant creatures of the earth and humans basically nonexistant . Its up to Spike to capture these monkeys , including Spector . I know its not the deepest story , but its really amusing and fun getting to travel through time through the dinosaur age up to the future . Later on in the game I actually found it compelling . You also really grow to love Spike by the time you finish the game . I understand now , why alot of people who play the sequals wish Spike was the main character again.Gameplay elements and monkeys : Once again you catch monkeys , but its easier said than done . The first 3 levels are pretty easy , but by level 4 you will be introducesd by some of the harder and more hair pulling to catch monkeys in the game . The task of catching the monkeys is made harder by the fact that you have natural level enemies to worry about while chasing the monkeys down , like Man eating plants and annoying bees . I also have to mention that alot of monkeys are PACKING HEAT ! Laser guns , bombs , machine gun , HOLLYCOW ! Do n't get me started on the red pants monkeys later on who carry almost all these weapons as well as have extremely powerful scratch attacks that you can rarely avoid . There are different kinds of monkeys . I 'll just summarize what they do . Monkeys with light blue pants are wimpy and easy to catch . Monkeys with dark blue pants are fast little monsters and require patients to get . Yellow pants monkeys are the most common and have normal difficulty . Green pant monkeys carry missiles on their back and require stealth to get because their sensitive to movement . White pants monkeys sense you easilly and are hard to sneak up on ( understatement . Impossible unless someone says other wise ) . Black pant monkeys carry oozies/machine guns . I have to note the black pant monkeys are way harder to catch than the ones in the newer games . Then you have the abominations called red pant monkeys . Good lord do my heart stop when I have to catch one of these little bastards . Catching monkeys takes alot of patients and strategy because as you 've already guessed from my description of them , they are hard to catch . Throughout the game you are given multiple inventions from the professor that are essential to catching certain monkeys in earlier levels that could n't be caught before . Every invention is important in some shape or form and will either make a monkey easier to catch or harder , depending on the strategy used . The inventions are way better than the ones they give you in the other games . Some of the inventions in the other games are just plain useless . You also have lives in this game that you gain by collecting 100 gold arrows or a jacket . I 've had more game overs in this one then any of the other two.Levels : The levels are divided by eras ( the whole travel through time element ) . For example : Im in the dinosaur era and I play 3 levels from this era one after the other ( unlock them ) , catch the required number of monkeys , then leave , unlocking a new era with 3 more levels ( Hope that explains it good ) . Each level is unique and different which makes everything feel fresh and that much more awesome.Music : OMG ! Ape Escape has one of my favorite videogame soundtracks of all time . Not since Donkey Kong Country 2 have I entered levels just to pause and listen to the music . Ape Escape prooves music is a very important part of a videogame . The music excites you and is very enjoyable . It has the best track of the entire series and its ashame Ape Escape 2 suffers from its bland soundtrack . In Ape Escape 3 the music is reminiscent of the first one , so I think the makers learned from their mistake . My favorite tracks are Crumbling Castle , Dark Ruins , Galaxy Monkey , The Spector theme , and a few others , but the soundtrack of the whole game is just epic and fills my heart with nostalgia and joy everytime I hear one of them . It 's underrated and I wish more people knew about it.Replayabillity : Compared to the other games , Ape Escape 1 does n't have much replayabilty , unless you 're like me and love it so much you just start a new game all the time . Throughout the levels there are Spector coins you pick up . the coins are used to unlock 3 minigames in the time station . My favorite of these is galaxy monkey . The other two are meh . I really wish they had a way for you to unlock the soundtrack like the other two games . That would have been awesome.I 've gone down memory lane long enough . The sad part is I still have my old Ape Escape game , but it no longer works anymore . I 'm definately buying it off amazon . I wish instead of porting Ape Escape to the PSP , they would have ported it to the PS2 , with an soundtrack unlockable available . Given that attention is mostly put on the PS3 and other next gen consoles/games nowadays I do n't see a port happening soon ( the PS3 does n't even play older games according to some people I 've asked ) . Ape Escape is definately worth buying .	1
Here 's the premise - you 're this little guy with a net and a light sabre running around trying to capture these monkeys . The monkeys wear different colored pants , and have little sirens on their heads . The pants tell you how tough they are to catch , and the sirens tell you if they 've caught on to the fact that you 're trying to capture them.In addition to the trusty tools I mentioned above , you get a whole slew of other gadgets you can use to capture the monkeys , including an r/c car , slingshot and monkey radar . Unfortunately , the monkeys are also armed with everything from grenades to machine guns to canons.In addition to being hilarious ( the commercials for the game were great , if you got a chance to seem them on TV ) , the joy of the game is using the analog controllers to move and manipulate gadgets.The game was the perfect difficulty , not too hard as I had suspected it would be . I still have n't completely finished , and look forward to hours more fun netting those pesky little chimps !	1
What can be more fun than running around chasing monkeys ? the are plenty of levels and gadgets to play with . The only downside is that the paddle boat is impossible to control in my opinion . Each monkey has its own charateristics and weapons . just trying to run up and snag the monkey does n't always work . special gadgets must be used first . Pretty much run around the world getting rid of monkeys using gadgets . The game is pretty explanatory but is loads of platform fun . also includes minigames that can kill some time with friends .	1
I love APE ESCAPE . It is the best Playstration game ever . Just look at the other revues if you do not believe me . You need a dual shock controller to play this awesome game . the mini games are really cool .	1
Ape Escape consists of more than 20 3D levels based on a variety of time zones . To clear a level , Spike ( played by you ) must capture a set number of monkeys . After filling that quota , you must access the next level . Reaching the monkeys will require you to jump , sneak , swim , climb and fly through a variety of situations . To help you on your way , you are given a net and a lightsaber type stun club . Throughout the course of the game , Spike will collect six additional gadgets . In addition to providing the means of completing future levels , returning to previous levels with new gadgets will allow Spike to capture any monkeys he left behind . In addition to monkeys , each level has tokens to collect . Collecting enough tokens will open minigames . This game gets addicting pretty fast .	1
I got to admit , I know the game is aimed more towards kids but I 'm 35 and I had a blast with this game . I never even heard of the game til it was shown to me in someones ' collection . Being bored one day , I put it in the Playstation to check it out and , lo and behold , I played that game til early the next morning . The object of the game is to catch all the monkeys lose in each level . Trust me , it is n't as easy as you might think . It takes some smarts to get them lil critters . Armed with several different gadgets , you 're a one-man monkey catching machine . I know it might seem like a silly game to you but it 's one of the most fun games I 've played in a long while . You definitely owe it to yourself to see what it 's all about .	1
If you 're trying to build up a classic PS1 collection , make sure to include this wonderful lil platformer . It may not be the quality of Crash Bandicoot , but then again not many games live up to that series .	1
What can I say ? You are catching bad monkeys with a net . How can that not be fun ? It starts off not that impressive the first few levels but do n't let it fool you . It gets much better . Easily my favorite platformer on the PS1 .	1
One of the best PS game ever . It is just plain great ! Definetly get it if all you have is a PS .	1
This is a great game ! I had it when I was younger . It 's still better than 2 and 3 . BUY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
Ah , the year was 1999 . While Sony and Nintendo were clashing , people thought that 2000 would be the end or at least the end of their computers . SpongeBob SquarePants began to reign to over kids , along with Pokemon . And some people were wondering why their Ape Escape game would n't work as they threw their non-Dualshock controllers down on the floor , while I was hating the game for not knowing how to play it . However , when I got it together , it became one of my favorites until its demise in 2008 , when , wanting to make an ISO of my aging disc , I found it with a huge crack on it , under unknown circumstances.So , now that I 've got a little of my nostalgia out , onto my review of this unique little game.GRAPHICS : Blocky , polygonal , and furthermore , colorful . In other words , it is the typical PS1 game . Nothing like a PS3 's , but who cares ? MUSIC : A big kudos to the people who composed to the music , because even after ten years it is still fun to listen to . Catchy , synth-like riffs fill this level , each level having a unique soundtrack . What 's also cool is when you crouch , some of the instruments cease.SOUND/VOICE ACTING : The sounds , while sort of primitive , are also catchy . The swoosh of the net will be music to your ears , along with the footsteps and other stuff . The voice acting , while so-so , is actually the best voice acting in the trilogy . I wish the cast would have stayed for 2 and 3 , but oh well.STORY : Simple , but pretty original . Specter , the most popular monkey in the monkey amusement park , finds the Professor 's Peak Point Helmet , which enhances intelligence . Once he puts it on , he wants revenge for being locked up in there , so he makes more , gives them to all the monkeys in the park , and he raids the Professor 's lab to use his time machine to rewrite history so apes can rule the world . Now only Spike , who kind of looks like Yu-Gi-Oh , can capture the monkeys , defeat Specter , and save his friend , Jake , who is under Specter 's control.GAMEPLAY : Now here 's where the game truly shines . Before I talk about the actual gameplay , however , let me discuss the controls.The Dualshock controller had been out for a while , but was still unneeded to enjoy the game . All it provided was vibration , and the ability to play with the analogue stick , the right stick as useful as wisdom teeth . Then Ape Escape came along and changed everything . Those without DS controllers had to get some to enjoy this game , whilst many tried to figure out the layout . The directional pads were only used for the camera , while the triangle , square , cross , and circle buttons were just used to change gadgets . It was then where the right stick , the L3 , and the R3 , ( the latter both not having a title yet . It was just ` push the left/right stick down like a button , ) finally got their chance . This paved way for more functions for the Playstation controller.As for the gameplay itself , it is a blast , even if it 's your 10th play . You time travel to many eras , your mission being to catch the apes . You also got gadgets , which help you solve puzzles and catch some out of reach monkeys . You start off with a stun club and a net , but you later get a total of nine gadgets , each having their unique function . The apes themselves are diverse , with each color of pants they wear representing their abilities . Some move so fast that you must catch them via stealth . After all , this was made a year after Metal Gear Solid came out . You do n't have to catch all the monkeys in the level ( some you ca n't until later when you got a different gadget , ) but if you do , you can play the level with a time trial , which gives you nothing , but is fun . You also need to catch every single ape if you want to catch Specter . Your health is represented by cookies . You can also get Specter Coins , which allow you to play three different mini-games once you get the required amount . There 's a skiing game , a boxing game , and a space shooter game , the last one the best IMO . There are also two racing levels where you race the brainwashed Jake for Specter coins.As for bosses , there are none until you get to Crumbling Castle . It 's a shame , because the bosses are fun to fight . Instead , the game relies on enemies to keep you at bay besides the apes . You ca n't kill the apes , but you can kill the enemies and get goods . You 'll have to search everywhere for those damn dirty apes , from the ocean to the Ice Age to even inside a dinosaur.Ape Escape , overall , is quite a fun game . It 's not too hard , but it 's still entertaining . This is a must buy . They also remade this game for PSP , but I never tried it . But I think AE is best on the big screen with a controller .	1
The entire ape escape series is amazing . The graphics are very good for the original PS , and the gameplay is fantastic . I 'm pressed for time , so I have to give this game a 9.5/10 .	1
Graphics : 9/10 - Nothing is ugly in Ape Escape , it all looks totally fabulous . The character movements and designs are extremely nice and the attacks and training scenes are all beautifully put together.Sound : 8/10 - A groovy score and neat sound editing techniques make Ape Escape 's sound thoroughly plausible.Value : 9/10 - Endlessly fun to play . Ape Escape is a game you will start once and start again , start once and start again . You 'll play it so many times ; you may take over 10 whole memory cards ! Overall : 9/10 - This should n't be overlooked because of its frankly silly plot . It 's stunningly enjoyable to play and really gives a good use to the analogue controller .	1
This game is awesome . It 's been a long time since I played it , but I know that from playing it it 's one of the best games you could own . It 's a very fun and creative game . The various levels and story make it a great game to enjoy.Yes , it 's probably going to be difficult at times , however , not impossible , just challenging . Believe me , having the challenge is totally worth it.I remember going through it , the levels were so very detailed , and very well done . You 'd have to react fast , at times , and be smart.Even more fun , they even added some extras . I believe you might have to beat the game to unlock them , but they are also great to play through.I 've played quite a few games since last I played this and this still ranks as one of the best games I 've ever played . It 's a great worthwhile story which I think a lot of people would enjoy.It 's got good length to the story , a good difficulty , and a reason to play on , as well as to play again.Whilst I know this is an older game , something I know from playing a lot : some of the old games are still some of the best games ever made.I think breaking out the PS1 is worth it . Although , if you have a PS2 you can play it on there . I should know , I 've played another PS1 game on a PS2.Well , if you 're just reading this to advertise , or if you 're reading this to buy , take my advice , this is a great find , totally worth it . Even if you do n't want to get this for you , if you know someone who wants to find a great game like this , this is a game to get.Well , thanks for reading , enjoy , have a blast .	1
I saw this game , and it looked amusing , so I got it . I soon found out that it had unique gameplay and was unlike any game I had played in the past . It 's really fun , and you get hooked on it . Plus the unlockable mini games are a cool bonus . The problem was the camera ( which could really be annoying at some times ) and the challenge . Here 's my tip : If you 're an advanced gamer , 12 or older , rent this game , but do not buy . Most 11 year olds , and even some 10 year old have found this game easy . But if you 're younger than that , you 'll go ape over this game .	1
This game was so cool it nearly gave me a heart attack ... literaly ! The mad man none as Specter who puts on blinking red , yellow , and blue helmets with sirens . The blue sirens mean they do n't hear or see anything . The yellow sirens is when they hears something . And the red sirens is when they see you or if your chasing them . So Specter put the helmets on them and formed a monkey army to destroy Spike and Jake . And you can get thounsands of Gatcha Gagets and I 'm not telling you what they are . And Gatcha coins and Specter Coins . YOU HAVE TO PLAY THIS GAME ! ! ! Also play these games Ape escape 2 & Ape escape 3 .	1
Unfortunately , the greatest hits edition freezes during a certain cutscene and is unplayable . Fun and hilarious game overall , just get the original version .	1
I thought Spyro The Dragon was great , but when I was done , I was looking for some other great action/adventure games.Ape Escape took the place of excitment , and it did n't fail.You 'll love this game !	1
Back when I first owned my PlayStation , I tried many games from Blockbuster . I 've been a fan of Crash Bandicoot , and actually it was that series that compelled me to choose a PlayStation over a Saturn ( thank goodness ) , so I quickly became of fan of platforming games . Not to mention that I loved Super Mario 64 , but , since I did n't own an N64 , I was forced to play it only when I visited my cousin's.One day , while browsing my local Blockbuster , my sister saw a cover with monkeys on it . With that and Rugrats , she checked out the counter with my selections , and we went home that day to play games . I do n't remember what games I checked out ( FFIX ? ) , but Ape Escape was the one title we played together until we had to return it.Her following birthday , I bought it for her . You may think , `` Oh , that 's nice , '' but I bought it because I actually wanted to play it ... It was the first game I 've ever completed in its entirety , and I go back from time to time to replay it , no matter how many times I 've caught the monkeys . The sequels are good , but this stands out as the first game to fully require the DualShock controller , and the music in this installment is my favorite in the series.Monkeys have taken over different periods of history , and so it 's your job to catch them all and bring down the leader . You get helpful gadgetry along the way , and they 're all extremely useful and you 'll find yourself using them all to the very end . Sometimes some games give you arsenals that become obsolete a few levels later ; not here . Every level can use all your tools.The boss fights are sparse , but the final boss more than makes up for it . It remains one of my most favorite boss battles , though , by today 's standards , it 's pretty easy.I write this review only a couple weeks after my latest playthrough , and the game still holds up extremely well . I thought that , with my years of gaming experience , catching the monkeys would be a lot easier . While I know most of the game 's secrets , and the easier levels were far easier than before , the monkeys still prove a challenge to capture . The patterns for boss fights are easy to get down , and I experienced no degradation in my original copy of the game when playing on a PS3.This game should be a requirement for all PlayStation owners .	1
I got this game as a gift during the Christmas of 99 , and since that time it still is ranked as one of my top 10 favorite games ! The graphics my be crap by todays standards , but this game had a great story , awesome gameplay , and ( at the time ) mind blowing us of the dualshock controller ! Whether you 've played this game before or not , if you want a trip down the nostalgic lane then play Ape Escape !	1
Great game , I dont really think its a little kid game ... im 14 and i still think its tough.The controls are very hard to get used to.Besides the goofy storyline and tough controls , its still an awesome game .	1
Ape Escape is an awesome game with amazing graphics and great storyline . The game has over 200 different monkeys , each with hilarious attitudes . This was ( no doubt ) my favorite game of all time , cuz I just love playing adventure/platform games . This game is not easy to beat if you want to complete it 100 % . There are time trials for almost every level and cool mini-games . It took me over a month to beat the game 100 % , but I 'm just an average gamer . I recommend this game , cuz it 's fun , exciting , cool , and CHEAP $ $ $ !	1
I read alots of review about this game , alot of people said that Ape Escape was good , so I decided to buy Ape Escape for myself.Geez they were right , this game is great and fun.This is a fun game I mean I have to catch those monkey on different level and sometime each land have 4 or 6 or over 10 that each of the land that the monkey stay.There about 8 weapon/gaget that I can use to kill the enamy and to help me out on some hard place to reach.This game have 25 level and 200 monkey to catch , this game can be play for everyone , & quot ; like the esrb rated said on the front & quot ; .Ape Escape is mild animated violence , there no gore or bad word on it & quot ; just wanted the parents to know it & quot ; .I never get tired of playing Ape Escape , this is a really fun to catch the monkey.Get this game you wo n't be dissappointed , I have n't too !	1
Duke Nukem 64 is a very well made game , despite the fact that some people only know it for its controversial material [ most of it removed for the N64 version ] and its cheesy one-liners . It turns out that this game is much more than that.PROS+ Thirty challenging levels , and they are n't short either . We 're talking ten or more minutes on each for the first run.+ Secrets are abundant and it will take ages to find them all by yourself.+ `` Duke '' as a character is great , adding humor to the game with his one-liners.+ A well put together co-op mode and a deathmatch mode with working bots.+ Four levels of difficulty , even for the deathmatch mode.+ A great control scheme for the N64 controller , with added control schemes to have you pick from.CONS- Hiccups in frame rate occur when several explosions appear on the screen.- The only music in the game is the title music.- No ability to save in the middle of the game , you have to save at the beginning of a level.All in all , this game is worth it . If you are looking for some challenging , retro gaming action this is a must-have for your collection .	1
i love this alien killing game . like every game they got there easy then there harder areas . from 1 to 10 a 10 i will say a great n64 . you may not be able to tell what he is standing on well that is the aliens he killed .	1
The game is cool but a lot of the levels are really dark . A lot easier to play with cheats . Im on level 23 and there are still more to go . Its two players which is the only reason its good . Otherwise zero hour is way better .	1
Duke Nukem 64 is n't a bad game . In fact , it could be one of the best on N64 . I do n't know . I havent played much shooters on N64 . But , I do own this and chaotic DM with 2 freinds and a bot could n't get better . Quake 64 and Doom 64 ca n't offer this much fun . THis is essentially a port of the pc game , but with new levels and add-ons to existing levels . I recomend this game .	1
This IS the funnest game I have ever played . If your looking for a game with good graphics , this is n't for you , though . But if your down with old school hardcore action then you need to buy this !	1
Ever since this was released i'v heard non-stop complaints about this game from PC owners about the N64 port . Yes , it has some censorship ( The Strippers do n't strip ) . Maybe the graphics were n't as good ? But for many of us , this was our only option of playing this game . Not everyone had PC 's capable of playing games like Duke 3-D back in the late 90 's , so this was our best option . And Hot Damn ! I got my money 's worth out of this game ! Not only is the single player tons of fun and have so much replay value . But the multi-player as well . Endless hours of death match w/my friends & I . It seems like ( especially in the 90 's ) that PC gamers would get mad anytime a port of `` their '' games made it to the consoles . `` The graphics are n't good enough , the sound sucks , the gameplay engine is broken '' ect ect . Duke , Doom , Myst , Quake ... .I heard it a million times . But IMO opinion , the ports were a way for the rest of us to experience these games . And I was glad to have em ' !	1
If you are a huge fan of the Doom games , then you will love this . Its Doom , with more of a humorous side .	1
I remember getting this game and being blown away ! The aliens , the gore , the raunchy bad @ $ $ hero Duke Nukem ... AWESOME ! Ofcourse now we have Call of Duty , Battlefield , Dead Space , etc ... But if you are wanting a vintage gem pick up this game ! I stayed up countless nights with friends playing through the game in co-op mode and facing off with each other in team death match . Solo player itself was quite challenging , and still is . I have always felt this game sort of set the stage for FPS along with Perfect Dark and Golden Eye.Bad points : It can be irritating because it is so challenging . Also , there are a lot of extremely dark areas of maps that make it hard to see ( maybe even impossible ) . At the time of its release I thought the graphics were great , but now that I play through it again , they are kind of disappointing . I mean , still decent for the time but considering similar games that were on the 64 ... they could have done a bit better.Good points : Weapons are awesome . SMGs , plasma canon that evaporates everything in its path , pipe bombs , shrink ray allowing you to crush your enemy , expand ray that enlarges them until they explode ... HA just coolness . Combat boosts were always a neat item that I wish had been in more games . You can also aquire a jetpack , Vitamin X , holoduke to confuse enemies , dumdum ( explosive ) pistol rounds , and many other helpful items.Fairly smart enemies and a wide variety of aliens . Challenging bosses as well.A lot of objectives on each map . Rescue the hidden `` babes '' , find keycards , solve lock puzzles , even crush toilets and drink the water to regain health . And you get a good number of maps too ! I would suggest picking this game up , you get a lot of play time out of it . Its a good blast from the past for us who miss the N64 on occassion .	1
This is one of the best shoot 'em ups on the 64 . This game is pretty much the same as the PC version , but with more levels , extended levels / or added bits and peices , and a few new toys.It pretty much feels just like the PC version but it 's a little darker on the graphics . You will have to run trough the game control settings to find the right feel for you if you 're like me and where used to using the keyboard.Most of the cool stuff is still there from the PC game . There is the same sayings , some new ones , same levels etc.. whats missing is the adult content the PC had packed into it . So some things are different like , there is no strippers dancing around , and you ca n't go up and press OPEN to throw them money , and the posters are different etc ... infact the second levels strip club has been completly re decorated into an out-door loading dock with trucks . Thats a bit of a disapointment that that stuff was replaced to tone it down.There is some new toys to play with , but overall , there isnt enough weaopens . There is a hand gun , shot gun , machine gun , plasma shooter , grenade thrower , shrinkin ray , enlarging ray ( new weopen ! enlrage youre enemy till the explode ! ) and a few other ones . But compared to something like Goldeneye , there feels like harldy any guns to choose from.I used to love to use cheats on the PC version , and with this 64 version , there are a couple of cheats , but there 's none to walk through walls which I do miss. ( ... ) it 's pretty hard to stay alive , so turn the god mode on and enjoy it .	1
This game is the best ! 4 people OR 4 DukeBots ( computer controlled multiplayer opponents , hella cool ) to challenge in multiplayer , each higher difficulty meaning more bodies flying in the air ( you can have ppl and dukebots play at the same time ) , 2 player co-op , and one heck of a single player experiance . Who would n't want to save babes while bustin in a movie theater shooting alien scum all over the place ? Pig cop with a shotgun ? Introduce him , to your grenade launcher , BattleLord giving you a hard time ? ? ? throw him a pipe bomb party ! Your options of fighting opponents are endless with dukes arsenal of guns ranging from shotguns , sub machine guns , grenade launchers , missle launchers all the way to trip mines ( great in multiplayer ) , and shrink guns which allows you to shrink your opponents and crush like a bug with your 15 size boot . The guns are the best yet in an fps . The gameplay is hot as well , your environment is your playground , use toilets , blow up toilets , bust open a movie screen in the theatres , discover cool secrets by blowing open walls , PLAY POOL , the list goes on . Bust open aliens as you make your way saving babes , searching for key cards , finding hot new weapons , and having one helluva time . Do you have what it takes to save earth from aliens , can duke save his babes before aliens use them for mass production ( weird , I know ) , always bet on Duke . Are you bored of my review and eager to get this game ? ? ? STOP READING THE THING AND GET DUKE NUKEM 64 ! !	1
This is my favorite Duke Nukem game . It 's got a ton of levels to explore and the variety in the levels keeps things interesting . I played it when it first came out for the N64 and after beating it traded it . I got nostalgic for it so bought it again last year to play . What a great trip down memory lane . I was taken back to the first time I played it and it was just as fun . The graphics look even better on my 46 '' lcd than they ever did on my old tube tv . A great game for those who like older shooters with some humor .	1
Never did I think I would be able to own this game because of the prices I 've seen it listed as , found it for a steal brand new and works great ! Have n't stopped playing , this hardcore Final Fantasy Fan is beyond pleased .	1
I ca n't believe how many gamers are hailing this game as the best final fantasy ever ... i mean i know everyone has a different opinion and all but i mean come on , has n't any of you played final fantasy 6 ? that game pretty much did everything this game did , only so much better . where do i begin ? characters : cloud-an emo whiny brat that annoyed me to know end . i wish there was a shut up spell in this game to make him stop crying . barret-how many black stereotypes can we fit into a single character ? lame.Tife-hey she has a killer body , not much personality but hey sex sells right ? . Yuffie-what was here purpose again ? . -aeris-hey someone with potential , too bad she died before we could start to care . cait sith- although i should n't have to explain why this character is lame , ill do it anyways ... .hes a cat , that rides on a stuffed animal robot ... .pause for laughter ... .a CAT that rides on a robotic stuffed animal ! ! ! ! ! ! then there is Vincent : basically there for five minutes of an already convoluted story line that is other than that piece of the story he is in is an intirely optional character , and can be put in the OF NO REAL IMPORTANCE folder . oh and i almost forgot Cid : yup his character was so awesome that i almost for got to mention him . and then finaly Red 13. another character that had potential , but when your surrounded by a bunch of numbskulls , in a convoluted story line , you stop caring about one character that has potential.then there is the main bad guy sepheroth ... many people say he is the best bad guy EVER ! ! ! ! `` Sepheroth is so BAD TO THE BONE man he rulz ! ! ! ! '' he was equally as much of a whiny emo brat like cloud ( he wanted to destroy the world cause he missed mommy and a whole lot of other silly plot twists to make the storyline seem more advanced and mature ) . and i say this whoile heartedly ... .if you get defeated by a group of 1 ) an emo whiner 2 ) a woman who has no real point in life other than to be said emo 's love object ( and to sell units do to sex appeal ) , and 3 ) a CAT riding a robotic stuffed animal you are A ) not BAD TO THE BONE and B ) disqualified from the greatest villain of all time list . sorry.story line : convoluted . a lot of unnessisary plot twists , although it was servicable and interesting at points . it would have helped to add characters with ... character into the mix . also there was several completely unncessary scenes in it where i thought totally didnt add a single thing to the game ( the cloud in the bath tub with the dude or the cross dressing game ? ) plus the ending reeked of dont know what to do wiht the story line so lets just say this happens.gameplay : once again servicable but nothing revolutionary or even evolutionary . as a matter of fact , i think this game takes a step backwords instead of forwards . 5 had the job system . 2 had the unique leveling system . 6 had not only unique skills per character , but had awesome gameplay sequences such as the opera house , the stategic scens where you control 3 parties to more and block advancing troops , etc etc . what did 7 do ? had cool summon animations that got old after the second view and could not be skipped ... .pass ! ! ! ! graphics . they were horrible . yes even for that time . save for the stunning FMV sequences and the cool summon scenes ( that got old way too quick ) there was nothing pretty about this game . dull grey and bland environments abound . characters that made Lego characters look realistic , and just an overall boring and grimmy disgusting lifelesslook to the whole project.sigh ... where do you find best FF ever from this game ? Its not even close to the top 3. was it fun ? yes . did it make RPG 's popular in the states ? Yes ( although i prefer some of the other games that came out on the PS at the time , such as wild arms , suikodin , and revelations persona , more entertaining ) . but the best ? not even close . although i have to say it is better than 8 .	1
I saved my allowance for weeks to buy this game when it first game out . Now that I 'm an adult ( unless you ask my wife ) this game is just as awesome as it was then as it is now . The graphics are a bit old but the storyline is one of the best I have ever seen to date .	1
They really hit the mark on this one ! ... characters , storyline , play , music , graphics ... everything just superb for its time ! I played this game over and over again just to play it . It 's a fun game , but out of all the times I played it I could never defeat the Ruby Weapon . I think he 's like impossible or something ! LOL But even so , that was n't much of a let down because the rest of the game was so cool . And Sephiroth ... what a perfect villan . He looked pretty cool ! If you 've never played any of the FF series ( and even if you have ) , this is a definite 'must have ' !	1
Final Fantasy 7 is a classic . The game is great . The characters are special , the graphics were pretty good for its time , the game play was on point and who can really mention Final Fantasy 7 without mentioning the FREAKING MUSIC ? ? ! I really love the characters and just about everything else about the game . However , when you mix in the music everything just fit . I think this was the second Final Fantasy title I played after 3 . After playing 3 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 , Tactics and the first Tactics Advance game , I must say that this game is still my favorite Final Fantasy . It 's spectacular . And while I honestly do n't think I could play through the game again today it still holds up as one of the best games I 've ever played . Definitely the best RPG game I 've ever played . If I had n't booted it up and played it so much in the past I might feel different about owning it again . However , if you 've never played the game ( do you live under a rock ? ! ) then it 's really a great idea to try it somehow . If you missed it because you were too young/not born when it came out in '97 then do so . Now . : ) 5 stars .	1
Wow , the reviews here run the gamut ; while I am not surprised to see many bad reviews ( sometimes , I think that people are just feeling spiteful , as I myself have another incarnation that does the same thing ) , it is odd to read such statements as & quot ; This is destined to be the most disappointing RPG ever & quot ; ( and forgive me for ruining your writing for the sake of comprehensiblilty ) . FFVII was released in 1997 , became possibly the best-selling RPG ever , has been lauded by most critics for years , and this is 2004 . I think the ship of destiny has sailed.Anyway , I love this game . I have played it multiple times , and while it is n't my favorite FF title ( that honor is shared by FFVI and FFVIII ) , it holds a special place in my heart . I read in the spotlight above that one reviewer gave up on the game because Aeris died ; this seems odd ( I mean , really , these are only video game characters , and can someone really get worked up that much over the merely-physical death of a single heroine ? ) . I myself found this a bit silly ( characters get killed all the time in RPGs ; did n't Cloud have a Phoenix Down on hand ? ) , but it did n't detract from my enjoyment of the game . The gameplay , the sidequests , the graphics ( for their time ) , the Chocobos - all come together quite well in this title . I particularly enjoyed the frustration ( and ultimate satisfaction ) of defeating Emerald and Ruby , and the storyline is OK as well . I 'm sure that everyone has played this , but if you have n't , well , give it a try .	1
I love this game . It 's probably not the best Final Fantasy , but it 's still just so awesome ! The graphics make the characters look like they 're built of legos by today 's standards , and the story is confusing , but I still love it ! It 's got some of the best characters and one of the best soundtracks of any video game , and if you 're a video game-player and have n't yet played this , then get on it !	1
Sephiroth , the main villian of the game , is probably the best-dressed villian in a FF game . Also , he has the most sinister theme of any villian in any game . Everything about Sephiroth is sinister.You play Cloud , a man from the small city of Nibelheim ( sounds like a city in Germany ) . Cloud works for AVALANCHE , a terrorist group that 's fighting against the evil Shirna , Inc. As the game unfolds , you learn that Shirna , Inc does far more evil than AVALANCHE does . Shirna , Inc knows no end to its evil.One of the best games for the ps1 !	1
Final Fantasy 7 is the first Final Fantasy on the PSX and the first FF to not go through & quot ; The Nintendo Filter ( see FF II U.S. ) & quot ; . This game is an instant classic and if you have never played this game or even seen it , you are missing out . This game has it all . A good story , which I still debate certain things about with friends , excellent battles , fun characters , and all kinds of mini games ( a.k.a . the Gold Saucer ) . This also was the pioneering of FMV on games.The materia system in this game takes quite a long time to understand , but it will happen while you go through the game the first time . Thankfully there are plenty of tutorials in the game and the manual does a good job of explaining things.One thing I did n't like in this game is you can only have 3 party members in your battling party . This takes away from the strategy of battles . The only things that make your characters different is their limit breaks and what materia you have equipped to that character , and what weapon each uses . The translation is a little weird at times , but acceptable . After all , it was Sony that translated it I believe.But that last paragraph aside , why are you still waiting to play this game if you have n't already ? Buy it used , buy it new , borrow it from a friend , do something ! Rent it and play it for 50 straight non-sleep hours . You wo n't regret it no matter what you do .	1
WOW ! this is truly the BEST GAME EVER . if you 're going to buy any game this year , buy this one . full of charecters and storyline . just go to the store right now and buy this game !	1
This is the best game I have ever played in my whole existence . It has a great story and great fighting , any one who likes RPGs will like this game . I have beaten it three times and I still want to beat it a lot more .	1
The battle system could of been a lot better . Number one : There 's too many battles in the first place . You take three steps you get in a battle . You walk two steps to get somewhere and you end up in a battle . You take one step , most likely you 'll get in a battle . Also , let me point out that once you 're in a battle , you ca n't move around . And plus summoning whatever it is you 're trying to summon , like Thunder or something , you have to press eighty buttons just to summon it at once . It 's hard to do . However , I think that the game was engaging and never let ya go . It was entertaining , and it is undoubtedly worth the twenty bucks $ ... but ... the battle system could of been a lot better , I 'm sorry .	1
No matter how ugly this game is , I will never stop loving it.The characters are great , the story is awesome , I like the battle system and materia is easy to train and use.There 's a lot of places to visit , lots of bosses to defeat.It is really the characters that makes this game .	1
Simply the BEST rpg EVER made , final fantasy 7 is the frist 3D final fantasy for playstation and it is the best RPG with the best grafics , best songs , and best plots , no RPG compares to him .	1
As a video game perfectionist , I have played this game repeatedly over and over and over again in the past 8 years it 's been available for two reasons . One , to experience the game that it is again and again ... .this game never gets old or boring ... .EVER . I 'll be 80 years old and I would turn to this game to play it instead of helping the wife find her dentures.The second reason is because I am currently in a play-through of this game that I intend to make the absolute PERFECT file ... .and I am actually 2 Chocobracelets and 1 Precious Watch away from doing so.By perfect ( and I could go on forever here , since it took me forever without cheating whatsoever to achieve perfection ) I mean EVERY ITEM , ( Vagyrisk Claw , Earth Mallet , Fourth Bracelet , Behemoth Horn , or Umbrella anyone ? Those are just a few of the rarest items int he game ) ALL AVAILABLE MATERIAS ( set up on all 8 characters with the perfect combination so you can go into any and all battles , press attack once or cast Knights of the Round once , put the controller down , and go take a leak while the game beats itself ) Also , I have 99 of all the items possible to have 99 of ... .except some of the weapons and armor ... .you do n't really need 99 Gold bangles or 99 W-Machine guns ... .one of each weapon and 8 of each armor will suffice ... .one for each character.And lastly , and this is the hardest and most important to achieve- 255 status of EVERY possible stat- Strength , Speed , Luck , Vitality , Spirit , and Magic ... .I 've spent over 600 hours alone in the crashed Gelnika morphing enemies for the sources to max out my stats ... .and it is no easy task ... .you 'll need to morph about 170 Unknown 1 's for Power Sources PER CHARACTER , 210 Poodlers for Speed Sources PER CHARACTER , 230 Bad Rap 's for Luck Sources PER CHARACTER , 170 Unknown 2 's for Guard Sources PER CHARACTER , 180 Serpents for Mind Sources ( the hardest one to obtain ) PER CHARACTER , and 170 Unknown 3 's for Magic Sources ... .PER CHARACTER . So in the end you 're looking at morphing over 9,000 enemies ... .fun fun fun ... .but if you 're dedicated ( or insane , whatever you like ) like me ... .it can be done.I love this game so much , and am so dedicated from all these years , I could go into a boss battle stripped of all materia and weapons and armor and not take a hit ... .and win the battle with ease . 255 Luck evades all enemy hits on me ... . 255 Strength guarantees a hell of a hit on the enemy in retaliation for even thinking they can touch me . Not to mention the 255 Speed ... .allowing me to get in sometimes 2 or 3 hits on the enemy before they can even notice who just killed their pathetic a $ $ ... .heheGraphics , sound , playability , controls ... .etc ... .all 10 out of 10. [ ... ] Do n't miss out on the experience that is Final Fantasy 7 ! ! !	1
Whenever I 'm asked what my favorite game of all time is , the answer is always rather clear : Final Fantasy VII . No game before it and no game since then has managed to pull me so deeply into the story and have me hanging on every word like this one did . The characters , the music , the graphics , the story ... it 's all golden.The characters are simply unforgettable . Cloud , Aeris , and Yuffie were my favorites of the bunch . Each character has such wonderful design , half realistic half cartoonish , full detailed backgrounds , and such personality and potential to develop that I enjoyed following everyone one of them.The music and graphics sticks in my mind like nothing else . They worked so well together . From simple cut scenes to the most glorious of FMV . And unlike today 's games that throw long boring FMV in just for the sake of filling 2 DVDs , this game used FMV to make a point so poetically you could n't help but feel like you just watched an epic film . To this day there 's scenes that I cheer and nearly tear up over when I see them replayed . There were scenes that I would literally hold my breath through just in awe of not just the graphics ... but the sound , the motion , the story unfolding so elegantly . Squaresoft has a knack for this , no doubt about it . This is the Lord of The Rings ( film ) of video games.I wish I could sit here and just ramble on and on about the beautiful story and the twists , turns , and major events , but obviously that would ruin it for any who still have n't played this masterpiece of a game . I see many , many people today who have never played a game like this and are simply enthralled by today 's crop of PS2 RPG wanna-be 's and it really irks me . They simply do n't know what they 've missed and 9 times of 10 simply do n't care.I 've probably played through this 30 some hour quest at least 3-5 times , and I enjoyed it every bit as much each time through . It may not have the 200 hours of today 's games , but unlike today 's games it 's not freaking simulated boredom . It 's 30 hours of FUN and story like you 've never seen before . This game changed my perspective of how videogames could be , and is guaranteed a lifetime place in my favorite collection.- Rirath_com	1
FF7 is the greatest installment in the whole Final Fantasy genre . It 's 3D graphics , badass music , and intense , deep storyline , make it a classic to all FF fans out there . This game really got me hooked on FF . I beat 2 and 3 , but they did n't pull me in like this one . This game has the coolest villian in any of the games . Sephiroth 's looks , attitude , and sword skills can really kick your ass . The music in this game is also kick ass . So I would reccomend this game to a FF beginner or a veteran because it is absolutely flawless , and i think it 's the best game ever made .	1
What other video game has had a review put in quotes on the back saying `` Quite possibly the greatest game ever made '' ? I 've just bought my 360 and love playing it . I 've been playing games since oldschool Nintendo . I remember getting Mario Bros. 3 for Christmas.There 's only one game that has ever been able to take me completely out of my element and take hold of everything I love about games and never let go.This is the masterpiece that is Final Fantasy VII .	1
I love Final fantasy games and they never fail to be fun . This game was a lot of fun . I would n't say I love it though because there are ways it could have been better . It definitly was an awesome game , especially for such an old one .	1
Final Fantasy 6 , a.k.a . Final Fantasy 3 on the SNES , was a great success . Many magazines like GamePro and EGM have praised it for its rich plot and complex scenarios . Nintendo Power even called it `` the RPG hit of the decade . '' Fans of the Super Nintendo and RPGs rejoiced over how great this game was , and with a slew of other RPGs on the system like Chrono Trigger , ActRaiser , and Nintendo 's A Link to the Past , a lot of fans -- -myself included -- -generally regard this period as one of the best video game production times of our generation , if not THE best.Along comes the Sony PlayStation . For some , this marks the end of the Golden Age of classic video games . I do n't entirely agree , as that system was the home of a handful classics ; Castlevania : Symphony of the Night revitalized the Castlevania series and outranked many of the 3-D games that cropped up at the time . Metal Gear Solid redefined stealth action and brought Solid Snake into the mainstream . Mega Man X4 continued the saga of Mega Man X and combined the old-school flavor of Mega Man with arcade-style , frenetic action.Now , we get into Final Fantasy 7 . The first game , besides the original , to be correctly numbered . If you 've read my FF6 review , I said that that game was the end of the magic era and the introduction of industrial technology . FF7 takes that further into a dystopian technological atmosphere ; its bleak , dark outlook is not dissimilar to Ridley Scott 's Blade Runner . This was a stark contrast to the previous games that were about grandiose medieval adventure . No more dragons , colorful highlands , and sorcery . No more saving the princess from mortal doom . No more four crystals and light warriors.When I first played this game back in 1997 , my first thought was `` This is n't Final Fantasy ! I mean , they curse in the game , too ! How dare they change my Final Fantasy ? ! How dare they take away what I loved about it ? ! '' Yet , many of my friends loved it , and still love it for its nostalgic factor . Heck , it 's sold over ten million copies worldwide , making it the highest-selling Final Fantasy of ALL time.Coming from that stubborn mold , I did n't give the game an objective eye and realized years later that I initally rejected it under a false pretense . Is it my favorite Final Fantasy game of all time ? Well , no , but I am giving it its credit now , and there are many aspects of the game that help make it the top-selling Final Fantasy game.The story centers on a former SOLDIER named Cloud Strife , who joins the AVALANCHE group in trying to take down Shinra , Inc. , a megolomaniacal corporation that 's draining the planet 's life force . He 's a bit less colorful than some of the main characters of past Final Fantasies ( even further games ) , but through the course of the game , he has a very interesting backstory . He is joined by Barrett , the leader of AVALANCHE and the closest video game character akin to Mr. T ; Tifa Lockhart , a sexy martial artist and friend of Cloud 's ; Aeris , a flower merchant who turns out to be a `` Cetra , '' the previous owners of the planet ; Red XIII , a cat creature that was experimented on by Shinra ; Cid Highwind , a pilot with Dragoon Knight characteristics ( and ironically , shares the same last name as Kain from Final Fantasy 4 ! What delight ! ) ; Vincent , an immortal that previously worked with Shinra before his `` death '' ... and Yuffie , a young thief who plays tricks on the party . Oh , and then there 's Cait Sith , but let 's move on ... The villain that everyone talks about from this game is Sephiroth . In my FF6 review , I thought Kefka was the best Final Fantasy villain ever . I still believe that , but Sephiroth is still one of the greatest villains in any RPG . Sephiroth does have some interesting motives ; he is originally Cloud 's friend , even a mentor , and the best member of SOLDIER for a time . However , upon learning what appeared to be his real past ( not quite real , but no spoilers here ! ) , he progressively goes insane and is hell bent on bringing back the `` Promised Land , '' which basically means wounding the planet and sucking its life force . While he 's not your typical , heartless villain ( not saying Kefka is typical , but you feel from the first hour of that game that he is downright evil . ) , he is a mentally distraught , horribly twisted person , and that progression of madness that worsens throughout the game is actually very well transitioned . Plus , he is responsible for murdering Aeris , scarring the mind of my RPG generation forever.While the battle system only allows three people , the Materia system and the Limit Breaks add fun to the game . While I adore Final Fantasy 9 , 7 's Limit Breaks worked better , and they also level up . The Materia system is based on your weapons and items ' slots , allowing you to interchange materia like ice , fire , lightning , restore , and other things . They also do things differently depending on how they 're linked to other materia and ALSO if they 're attached to your weapon or your accessory . This adds some fun to the battle , and you can even interchange materia without disrupting the level of the particular materia slot you 're using.The story is as epic as any great Final Fantasy should be , although I do admit that the ending is a bit lax ... still , it was followed up by sequels , so at least the story did continue . Most of the characters are interesting , even colorful ( Cid and Barrett 's constant swearing definitely added flavor to this FF entry ! ) . Cloud 's complex relationships with Aeris and Tifa are among the story 's highlights , and of course , the culmination of Cloud facing his former friend and idol.The music is once again composed by Nobou Uematsu , and he delivers once again . My ONLY complaint is not with his compositions itself , but with the sound quality . The Sony PlayStation had a superior sound chip system in comparison to the Super NES , yet the sound quality of games like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 3 ( er , 6 ! ) blasted you with superb sound quality . I do n't hold this against the game to any large degree , but I did find that kind of odd ... especially if you hear Michiru Yamane 's score for Symphony of the Night or Toshihiko Horiyama 's score for Mega Man X4.Overall , my final opinion of the game . I 've grown to like this game despite my love for the more medieval-styled Final Fantasies of the past . This one was a departure from the past , adding more mature elements into the game ( colorful language , sexual references , etc . etc. ) . Definitely your big brother 's kind of RPG . While some may dispute its `` overrated '' longevity , its success on the Sony PlayStation became a part of that system 's legacy and it also brought RPGs to the mainstream audience.Yes , it 's insanely popular , but give the game its due . It 's worthy of the qualities that have made it the best-selling Final Fantasy , and while it may not be my personal favorite , it kicks major amounts of awesome nonetheless.Other Recommendations : Final Fantasy 6 ( in my opinion , perfectly accompanies this game ) Chrono Trigger ( SNES ) Breath of Fires 2 and 3 ( SNES , PSX ) Xenogears ( PSX ) Castlevania Symphony of the Night ( PSX )	1
This game brings back memories of when jason came over my house with his PS1 memory card and he was playing parappa the rapper in the basement and he was cool and this little girl she was a baby back then and now she should be around 9 years old well she was sucking on the memory card and when we put the card in everything was deleted LOL ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! and this game is great from graphics , to gameplay , to music . it has everything . you want a love story it has it . you wan na cry , it has it . you wan na feel good , it has it . everything it has to offer . the only this it doesnt have is for attracting ignoramouses that overlook the game and only care about whats new and graphics . and mike used to like it and he is in SOG 4 LIFE ! ! !	1
People seem to forget the number one reason Final Fantasy 7 is loved so fondly and remembered all these years later- it was one of the first video games able to tell a story that MILLIONS of people cared about . In fact , it 's probably the first RPG to ever tell such an incredible story . It was also groundbreaking back in the day having extremely-realistic cutscenes featured , along with a quest that carried over 3 discs . That 's why the game is remembered.However , I have no idea why the price for the game jumped up to almost 70 bucks these days . I guess because everyone who owns the game refuses to give up their copy .	1
Playstation 1 owners out there with a penchant for RPG games probably need no good word of mout from me , as this game is one of the staples for the system . However , for those who do n't have this game , get it ! ...	1
It was n't until the Greatest Hits version came out that I ever really took an interest in Final Fantasy VII . I guess it was because I wanted to pursue the game in my own time . Besides , back when this game first came out , you hardly ever found a copy on the shelf to buy . I was always one of the unlucky ones , it seemed . Finally , after obtaining a copy for myself , I got to see what all the 'hoopla ' was about.The story , itself ( as you probably already know by playing it ) , is about Cloud Strife . Cloud is a mercenary who joins with a group of others ( Avalanche ) to stop a megacorporation callled Shinra . Shinra is draining the life of the planet to use as an energy source . Course , the story progresses and deepens when Sephiroth ( the game 's main antagonist ) comes into play . Sephiroth 's part in this story ? ... if the world is damaged , its ' Lifestream will gather together in an attempt to heal the wound . Sephiroth plans to use a powerful spell called `` Meteor '' to cause this injury , and then merge with the planet 's energy , allowing him to be reborn as a god . Then , he plans to rule over the planet.Final Fantasy VII has a long history behind it . FF7 was planned , first , as a new game for the SNES and was quickly moved to Nintendo 's new system at the time , the Nintendo 64 . Due to lack of catridge storage capacity , it eventually led to a dispute between Nintendo and Square that resulted in Square ending its long relationship with Nintendo . Square decided , from that point , to release Final Fantasy VII for the Sony Playstation . The game has went on to sell well over 9.8 Million copies worldwide . It 's spawned a series of other games under the FF7 name but none have quite reached the status that the original has . A remake has been rumored for quite some time now but , as of yet , no remake has been produced by Square . My opinion on the remake or lack thereof ? Well , considering at to how they made a killing on fans buying the first game when it came out , it 's almost guaranteed that they would make a killing a second time . I do n't understand why they wo n't give the fans what they want . They 'd come out alot better because of it . It would , definitely , put them back on top as the leader of RPGs..to be sure . Course , enough on the subject , right ? Onto the meat of this review..What do I think of Final Fantasy VII ? ? First and foremost , it is quite an achievement in the RPG genre . It was the RPG where players found themselves in a three-dimensional world that , after playing the game , they actually felt like they 'd went on an epic journey . It 's the only game other than Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time where I ever felt that way . It was also the first RPG to really evoke some emotion out of me . The characters were n't two-dimensional , they had character and you could invest in that . It helped set the standard for all other RPGs to follow to this day . Too bad , though , you hardly see traditional turn-based RPGs like these anymore . Sure , you may on the Nintendo DS and the Sony Playstation Portable but not much on any of the console systems these days . While it may seem dated in a time when everything is in 3-D and not 3-D on prerendered backgrounds , it still stands the test of time . The story holds up as well , even if it is a little hard to figure things out at times . The battles are engaging and the game is just fun ! While I wo n't say it 's my most favorite FF game ; it 's one of the games that got me hooked on RPGs . There 's never a shortage of good things that can be said about this game.Do I have any gripes about the game ? Just one thing ... the ending . The ending is kind of sudden and , as another reviewer stated elsewhere , it just ends . Not quite like Legacy of Kain : Soul Reaver did back in the day , though ... nothing like that . The way it ends leaves you wanting more . Maybe it was intended to be that way ... you think ? All in all , Final Fantasy VII is a game that I highly highly recommend that everyone ( and I do mean everyone ) should play-at least once-even if you 're not into RPGs . It 'll definitely give you a better understanding of RPGs and why people love playing them so much .	1
This game is OK but not near as good as FF9 . FF9 has better graphics . The characters look like dolls . The cut scenes have good graphics . If you want this game get it for a cheap price or get FF9 . If your a big Final Fantasy buy it but if not I do n't think you should get it . I think you should buy FF9 instead .	1
While being an excellent RPG , it is not up to the caliber of the originals , especially III ( US ) /VI . There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV . Where this game really lacks is in its replay value . Its a onetimer . I do n't think I could bear to go though the whole thing again . There were too many things that were too tedious in the game , namely the materia and chocobo development ( which they drastically improve with IX ) . Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff , ie . master materia , just is n't worth it . As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest . Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets , but only really worth playing once .	1
Let me start off by saying , Final Fantasy VII is highly revered by many gamers as the best of the series , and like stated before , like the indie music scene its cool to hate what is so popular , strictly because it has mass appeal . I am a musician , and i 've fallen victim to this mindset many times before with pop music , and i 've learned when it boils down to it , Like what you like , and do n't worry about the mass appeal . I am not afraid to stick to my gun , this game is the best i 've ever played.This game was released in 1997 , and it was a launch game for the PS1 . I own a ps3 now and surely the games graphics can not compare to anything today , but when it was released , it had beautiful graphics compared to SNES ( or genisis ) graphics we 've seen before , and brought to life 3d textures which has not been seen in video gaming before . I still recall to this day playing through this game on the brand new playstation and getting fully absorbed in the story , graphics , and game play . I still play through this game to this day , atleast once a year , just to recap the wonders of this game.This game 's story is easily the most impressive story line I have encountered in video gaming history . I could read this story as a book and it would be the best book i 've ever read . The character development ( with the exception of Cait Sith ( strictly matter of opinion ) , there always seems to be one character that never gets much use in RPGs for me ) , and twists and turns make this game a EPIC TIMELESS CLASSIC ( even if you can muster through the bad graphics compared to this generation ) . I am a huge RPG fan spanning back to the SNES days ( first game system ) , and playing the greats like Chrono Trigger , and Final Fantasy 4,5 , and 6 , and really enjoyed those . Needless to say , This trumps all those games . I also played the more recent Final Fantasy games and still feel this game overtakes those . I was disapointed to see such neglect from Final Fantasy 9 because of its roots to the old school FF titles , because FF7 quite possibly was most people 's first FF game . FF9 is easily number 2 in my game rankings . Now there seems to be a clear cut line between fans of FF8 and FF7 . It 's usually you either like FF7 or you like FF8 , and you ca n't like both . This is the case for me , and many of my fellow FF gamers . I disliked 8 very much because it strayed away from what was beautiful about the FF series . I also feel the same with FF12 . FF7 strayed away from the FF series but kept old school FF gamers still intreged.This is your typical Turn based FF battle system , which many people tend to claim is a bad thing about RPGs , and i think the exact opposite . Turn based games let you think and figure out what you need to do to defeat a certain enemy , and not the same technique is going to work for every enemy , which I feel other genres tend to look over . Needless to say if Story is more important than gameplay to you , than this game is worth a run through . If you 're like many others and hate turn based games , and could care less about a story , and you just want to have fun without any of those constrictions , you might want to save your time , and skip this title.Another thing that is worth an honorable mention is FF7 's wonderful lush soundtrack ! I can listen to the soundtrack to this day and it will bring in the great memories of playing this game . The experiences of the game are excelently tied into the music and it will stick with you everytime you hear the score . I feel the strongest out of the FF 's sound track is FF9 ( for its pure variety in musical concepts ) , but FF7 comes in a close second.Knights of the Round materia makes this game fairly unfair , but to balance it out , they added two super bosses which are incredibly fun , and even out the playing fieldI do n't consider myself a hardcore gamer , but when it comes to RPG games , i 'll make the exception . I 've played nearly every FF game to date , and enjoy the ups and downs of each game . I also play other genres too , and even through genre crossing this is my favorite game of all time , and I think that wont change . The story is emotional ( ill admit it , it made me cry , thats how intense i felt it was ... alright time to man up ) and very intense , if you can follow it . This game made me offically a follower of RPG video gaming .	1
If you own a PS , PSone , PS2 , or a ( shutter ) PS3 . Then you need this game.I can not express how good it is . Go to any fan website on the internet and read up on it.You will get a good 70+ hours of gameplay.Anyone can just pick up and play , although this is NOT a game for those under 10 ( many , MANY cusses , suggestive themes , and animated violence ... .but that is why it is rated T , of course ) Please note that the aforemetioned warning is n't THAT graphic , just enough to not be suitable for an 8 year old.Overall : Gameplay:15/5Originality:5/5Storyline:5/5Fun : 10/5Overall Score : 35/5 ( Yeah , I love it THAT much ... : ] )	1
Let 's face it -- Final Fantasy VII got the whole thing started again . Back in the old days of 8-bit consoles and Commodore 64s , when Apple computers was n't nerd-speak for `` I do n't know how to run my machine , '' RPGs were a very narrowly targeted genre with little flavor or flash in them , and as the consoles outpaced the appeal of the text based , graphics poor style , they started to fall out of favor . It was this game that opened the door for the whole next generation of RPGs and brought the genre into the mainstream , and this game did all those things for very good reasons.I 'll start with the good , because I feel the need to stress that this is a game you 'll probably enjoy . There are a lot of flaws , but the fact of the matter is that you 'll probably only notice them if you go looking for them . What the game has going for it is a fairly intuitive gameplay interface , a cast of interesting characters , and a story that combines innovation with the same old epic qualities to make a nice , comforting blend . Those are the most evident qualities this game has , and they outweigh the shortcomings by a long way.But there are shortcomings , they are significant , and they need to be admitted to . First off , the graphics are just terrible by today 's standards . Forget history -- I want to know if this thing 's going to look good right now , and this is probably the worst game in the entire series in terms of current presentability . The CG movies , while impressive , are exceeded with flagrant ease by every other subsequent Square release , the screens are drawn in a fuzzy fashion that gave me a headache if I tried to play for more than two hours in a row , and the game suffers from severe graphical design schizophrenia . While I have enough imagination to reconcile the blocky , superdeformed character models used through most of the game with the slick , properly proportioned CG figures , that will definitely cause some people trouble . While this game was certainly visually impressive when it came out , these days it just does n't cut muster , and you need to keep that in mind when you pick it up ( even it 's next closest sequel in the series was infinitely better -- you WILL notice the graphics problems ) .This game also can have race issues if you want it to . If you 're overly sensitive about the issue , I 'd avoid this title . Barrett is the only black man in the entire universe , and he 's not that complimentary a character . I do n't particularly care -- he was supposed to be Mr. T , and he turned out well in that regard , but if you intend to read some kind of general statement on the merit of people of a particular shade , you may as well just let this one pass by.The story is also a problem , contrary to the high praise that die-hard fans often give it . This story is confusing for no particular reason , and the writers are totally lost in terms of how they want to tell their tale . I like the characters -- tell me what happens to them . No ? Okay -- then I 'm saving the world . So why do I care about this schmo 's childhood trauma ? The total effect was that when I got to the end of the game , I felt incredibly shortchanged in terms of story fulfillment , since the characters ' significance pretty much takes a nose dive on the third disk . The story is needlessly complex at points and the major inconsistencies are n't dealt with particularly well ( I do not consider a tube of goo an effective address to a plot hole ) . While the plot is innovative and epic , it is also confused and meandering , and you may have to play through it twice to figure out what 's going on.Again , though , I should stress that these problems are n't going to be too big if you do n't want them to be . These are things that you can ignore very easily while you play through the game . The gameplay itself ranks among the best balanced ever , with random monster encounters ( a BAD idea , but one that every game without Grandia or Chrono in the title seems to stick with ) well tailored to the characters ' levels and the game remaining appealing and challenging throughout . This one will appeal to just about anybody , and it should be in any RPG fan 's library .	1
All in all , it is impossible to not recommend Final Fanatsy VII to anyone who is even vaguely interested in RPGs .	1
Final Fantasy 7 is the best final fantasy game its fun and addicting great story awsome fun overall great !	1
This , for me , was truly a wonderful experience . I 've played this game countless times , yet over and over I find myself wondering why . When I first played this game , I had no idea I was immersing myself into the abstract but gorgeous world of Final Fantasy VII . You are the hero , of course , and you 're out to save the world , one step at a time . And really , that 's exactly what you do in FFVII . In classic Final Fantasy style , the seventh game in the series brings Cloud , a mercenary now working for a terrorist group , into your head . As you play , you can really understand where the characters come from and what their real selves are like . It might sound weird , but this is truly an incredible game . A wonderful experience for anyone who likes this series , or anyone looking for an absolutely outstanding story .	1
This is just one of those classic games to find my childhood . It really was one of the best RPG 's money could buy and still is . Just look at all the fanfare around the game the reason why people still play and talk about this game .	1
The only , only , only , only , only , only , thing that I did n't like about Final Fantasy VII was the Materia system . It takes an eternity to master all of the Materia . Other than that , this IS the greatest game ever .	1
I being a veteran of videogaming , have to say I 'm very dissapointed in the recent reviews bashing this game . Final Fantasy VII is what made RPG gaming what it is today.That being said , this game now well beyond its ' years is still the best RPG I have ever played . Close to being the best game ever . By todays standards , the graphics are horrid , but could n't have been done better . Very colorful and every part of this game was a refreshing look at something new . Your charachter goes from a centrally located city , to fortified town , to a beach resort , to an amusment park and so on and so on . At one point you end up in outerspace . There is to much to describe in a review , lets just say there is plenty to see and do.The gameplay is rediculously addictive . The materia gems were a good idea . Being able to fit elemental materia to weapons and armor allowed for great flexability . Combo certain materia together and your charachter could attack from two to eight times in one turn . The junction system in FF 8 is based on the materia system . Those who perfer 8 over 7 should compare and see that they are in fact fairly similar . Changing materia in mid-battle would have been nice in case of an attack that heals instead of hurting , takes one or more members of the attack team out of action.The amount of mini games is the most ever for any FF . the amusment park has an arcade and rides . A battle arena to compete for really good prizes . You can bet on , race and breed chocobos . The amount of things to do is astounding . The sidequest are fun and can help your party if you complete them . One could easily get lost and forget about the main story.The story is not the greatest , but it held my intrest when I first played FF7 . You never really take it seriously until one of your party members is killed 1/3 way in the game . The true enemy of this game is a cold blooded man with destruction and death left in his wake . The corporate enemy is nothing more than sidetracking cannon fodder for you to level up with . I guarentee a sense of satisfaction when finally putting the last boss away , for anything else , just for revenge would be motive enough . All charachter development is well done but a little awkward at times . Trying to make this story serious and funny at the same time , often leaves players wondering where the story is headed . For the most part , no complaints about the story . It 's told with the player in mind . Trying to find a way to connect with the player.The musical score fits this game . Only FF6 ( FF3 in the states ) is done better . At no point in this game does the music not fit the scenario the player is currently traveling.This game got a lot of publicity during its arrival and rightfully so . A magnificent piece of not only gaming , but art . Every RPG made after FF7 is based on what this game revolutionized . RPG before this were all 2D and pretty much cookie cutter RPG . This game literally changed RPG into what it is now , I hope those who recently bought this game at least attempt to finish it to gain the games ' beauty as a whole . Those who had this game from the beginning already know that Final Fantasy VII is not only a great game , but arguably PSX best of all time . A milestone , period .	1
Final Fantasy 7 is another excellent game made by Squaresoft . The same company that made Bushido Blade and Saga Frontier . It was the reason many people bought the Playstations they own and defiantly the one of the best during the year it came out.As far as game play goes its excellent . The controls are standard to RPGs . Combat basically is turn based ( which I highly prefer ) with a little bar that goes up as it gets closer to your turn . It has several very fun mini-games . Also there are many characters who show an actually personality during the game . There are several Vehicles you get as the game goes by to help you with your long trips across the large world.As far as plot it 's well done . Plot being the most important part to an RPG its good to see this game was strongest in this area . Even though I wo n't reveal much on the plot I will tell you it surprises you many times . Like most RPGs you do n't get a lot of control over the plot but that 's fine it 's still a good game . The plot does n't start to shake and get lost around the end it keeps you stuck form beginning to finish.The graphics are wonderful for their time . However newer games like final fantasy 8 , Parasite Eve , and Metal Gear Solid are defiantly better . Often the characters seem a bit boxy in it . The backgrounds almost always look beautiful though.And finally as far as length of time it can stay interesting is a long time . Final Fantasy 7 is not a game you well beat in four or five games . You well defiantly have to buy this game to beat it . It 's well worth the price though.Overall this game is good . I am one of those self-important jerks who things ff3 was the best though , but it did come close . It is defiantly worth playing .	1
Many years have passed since I first played this amazing title . Love it or hate it , Final Fantasy 7 broke new ground in the RPG market , and games today have a lot to be thankful for that Final Fantasy 7 made possible.For those who have n't played this title , it is going to appear very dated , especially the hideously deformed polygon characters . But the backgrounds are beautiful scenes based on hand drawn pictures . The backgrounds are set , so they do n't move . Instead you move around them . It was a style used extensively on the PS1 and still used in other games today ( especially on the portable systems ) . Granted , many of us would love to see a remake , and that might happen someday , but not likely any year soon.I will just sum up what I love about this game , even in today 's market of amazing games ( and a lot of terrible games or super easy games also ) . First , the game was insanely easy . I died once on my first play through ( against Lost Number before I realized what to do ) , and I do n't believe I saw a gameover screen since . But the ease of the game is not an issue . There is still some challenge , and part of what makes the game enjoyable is the lack of 'cheap ' enemies . But once you get the hang of things , it is super easy.The story is amazing , and only Final Fantasy 10 has really compared . Final Fantasy 6 was such a great title , that I never thought anything could top it , but FF7 just drew me in and did n't let me go . I could n't believe the intrigue , the depth , the complexity of the story . I found myself on edge at school ( I was in high school when it first released ) and I could n't wait to get home to play it . When Cloud goes against Rufus near the end of the Midgar arc , I knew I loved this game . When it took over 2 hours of game play to get to a world map , I knew something was special . And when the game cuts ( in real time ) to the CG of Junon 's cannon , I was stunned.With the pretty games of this era , one might be unimpressed , but if you remember the era when this game was made , it broke ground that developers feared . First true epic big budget RPG with cut scene CGI . Low to zero loading times ( so happy for that ! ) . A central character that is killed mid way through the game . And an amazing depth of side quests and extras at the end of the game that were fun and rewarding.Going back , it may not match up against some more recent titles in every facet , but overall this is still a solid and spectacular game . In my opinion only Zelda The Ocarina of Time and Super Mario World can compare with this title in overall quality and fun . Though I have other personal favorites ( big shout out for Ogre Battle ! ) , I can not argue that Final Fantasy 7 is among the three best games of all time , and easily the most ground breaking RPG ever . As nostalgic as the earlier titles are ( and I love them all ) , this game just proves that solid gameplay and an amazing story are timeless .	1
You know a game is probably pretty good when it has over 1,200 reviews written about it . This review , hopefully , will be slightly different than most - I love RPGs , but never played FFVII back in the day and just completed it for the first time . So I 'm not really biased due to loving the game back in my younger years and will try to review with an objective eye.As you can probably gather from the mountain of other reviews , this was the game that , for better and worse , changed the RPG genre . The , somewhat dense , storyline basically revolves around Cloud and company in their quest to save the planet from various forces ( mainly the evil company Shinra and , the very VERY evil , bad guy Sephiroth ) . Several traditional RPG elements are present - battle monsters , equip magic , find new and better weapons , grind your character up , etc ... So , what made the game different ? Basically , two things ( in my opinion ) . The first , as talked about above , is the storyline . Yeah , it 's the typical , `` save the world '' stuff that can be found in oodles of other RPGs , but this it is different - it was deep , filled with twists and turns , and was more like an actual story you would find in a novel . Some would say the story borders on being convoluted ( a complaint I have a hard time arguing with ) , but it holds up well today and was nothing short of groundbreaking 10-15 years ago.The second was the amazing graphics and cut scenes . Of course , neither are nearly as good as the more recent stuff , but again it was revolutionary at the time and everybody loved it . Combining the `` fun '' elements of RPGs that were already present with a deeper story and amazing graphics and it is no wonder this is one of the most beloved games of all time.Still , the game does have its warts . First , it is a very linear story . Part of the charm of some of those early Final Fantasy games ( and other RPGs ) was the feeling you could explore the entire world . Here , for about two-thirds of the game , you have no control over where your characters go or what happens ( it 's really like reading a book ) . By the time you actually get the airship ( and can really start exploring ) you are just about ready for the final showdown . Plus some of the really cool weapons to found can not be obtained until you have virtually completed the game ( Final Fantasy games have done this for years , and I have never understood it , what is the point of these amazing weapons when , by the time you can acquire them , your characters are so leveled up they are killing everything with ease anyway ? ) .The second major issue , touched on above , is the fact that this story is tough to keep up with at times . I 've played Crisis Core ( the prequel to this game ) and that helped a lot , but there are times when you are just going to be like , `` what in the blue sane h*ll is going on here ? '' Yeah , the story is different , but different is n't always better.Overall , the game is one of those games that should be played by all gamers . Yeah , there are problems ( the story , the somewhat dated graphics , the linear game play ) , but it 's still an amazing play . By the way , you can download the game from the Playstation Store for both the PSP and PS3 for [ ... ] - so do not pay these insanely high prices .	1
The story and plot are interesting enough to keep a gamer entertained . Gameplay is entertaining , but also challenging.I can not give the game five stars though . I had already played the likes of FFX and Xenosaga prior to playing this game . Their superior visuals and certainly the inclusion of voice-acting made the experience more enjoyable than FF7 . In other words , I would have enjoyed FF7 if I had experienced the game prior to playing more recent RPGs .	1
This is probably the best RPG that ever has and ever will be released . I 've had it since it 's release in 1997 and beat it several times and I plan to again . It just does n't get old . The graphics are still great , but a little outdated of course because technology is getting better . But it still looks pretty . The battle system is the best of any of the Final Fantasy games , even the newer ones . In fact , I think that the battle system of FF7 is the best of any RPG . The music composition is great as well , even if it is just one guy on a synthesizer . It 's great . Let 's see ; the gameplay is perfect , the music is perfect , the battle system is perfect , the character 's are loveable , and the best part is ... the story . This game is truly a classic and I recommend it to collectors and gamers alike .	1
This game blew me away when I first bought it . It 's one of the best Final Fantasy games out there . The graphics are n't great , but you should mostly enjoy the storyline , not how it looks.The story begins when Cloud Strife , a teenager who joined a secret organization known as AVALANCHE , tries to help destroy huge machines called Mako Reactors , which suck the planet 's life energy away in order for electricity to exist in Midgar ( a city ) . Oh , and as for the evil man who 's behind this deed ? President Shinra . It was the president of Midgar who built the reactors , and now , it 's up to Cloud , Tifa , Barret , and the rest of AVALANCHE to bring Shin-ra co. down.But after Cloud meets an old `` friend '' from long ago , the story quickly takes an unexpected twist ... In this game , you 'll experience many different emotions for the characters , you 'll fight hideously powerful bosses , find two secret characters , even breed Chocobos like you could in previous Final Fantasy games ! And do n't forget that you can even enter them in races as well ! There are just so many more reasons to call this game classic , so I recommend you find it and have huge loads of fun !	1
While this game may not be the very best RPG in my opinion , I must give this game credit for being able to finally throw the RPG genre into the mainstream for two gaming generations . This game was the first game in the series to feature stunning FMV with 3D character models in pre-rendered backgrounds , which was a major step up for the RPG world , considering that any RPG released before this one either only had 3D models during battle sequences or none at all , but of course graphics are not everything . Gameplay will always matter much more than the graphics in any game ; it is the sole reason games are played , to enjoy the game itself with graphics just being an added bonus to the already great game itself.This game still maintains the fast-paced ATB system where the characters must react in a timely manner to defeat the enemies or bosses that will cross paths with the characters controlled in the battles . One of the greatest highlights of this game is that this is the first game in the series to have a science fiction based plot otherwise unseen in earlier titles , and very few other RPGs at the time.This game is also the first in the series to add character peripherals such as `` materia '' . Materia can be equipped and can be made more powerful each time it is used.Overall , I would highly recommend this title to advanced and beginners alike , as this game has a straightforward level up system with a neat addition of the character peripheral I have mentioned above . This should last one a good 50-70 hours , depending on whether one decides to undertake the various sidequests offered in the game or not .	1
I doubt that there will ever be an equal to this epic game , Final Fantasy VII . It 's the reason I became the gamer I am today ! Final Fantasy VII puts you in the shoes of a young man by the name of Cloud Strife . Starting off , you 're simply a mercenary hired by a resistance force called Avalanche , whom are fighting against the earth-dominating orginization , Shinra . Progressing through the story , however , you find it goes much deeper than that . Throughout his adventure , Cloud strives to find the link between him and his arch enemy ( but once friend ) Sephiroth , what Shinra is planning for the world , and struggles to find where his emotions lie in a deep love triangle between his long-time friend Tifa , and the kind-hearted flower girl , Aeris . Of course , along the game there are many other characters and sub-missions that lead to different stories , but either way this game promises to leave a lasting impression.The gameplay , much like the story , is simply amazing ! As you progress through the game , you will find new Accesories ( items such as rings , ear rings , ribbons , etc . ) , Armor , and Weapons . Depending on each items power , your overall strength for attacks , defense against attacks , magic effectiveness , and magic defense will increase ; however , the true depth comes in the junction system . Each item you equip to yourself will give you junction blocks . These blocks are used to equip magic that you buy or find along your journey . Magic comes in many forms : Some increase stats , some heal , some are attacks , some are devastating monsters ( called 'Summons ' ) that unleash devastating attacks on all enemies , and some help you attain more items ( such as the ability to 'Steal ' ) . Junctioning magic can also lower stats , bringing more strategy into the game . Junction too much magic , and your character 's overall hp ( or 'health points ' , which decrease with each hit ) will be minimized in the next battle . Junction to little , and your character will be to weak to inflict any useful damage on the enemy.My final great aspect in this epic edition of this great series , is the music . The music in the game effects your overall emotions as you play , making the game look and feel even more amazing . I guarantee that after playing this game , you 'll find yourself humming at least two of its tracks ! So in conclusion , this game is FLAWLESS ! If you want something that will satisfy your gaming pleasure for many a day , this is it . Final Fantasy VII is quite possibly the best game ever made , and in my opinion is still unrivaled .	1
My cousin was a HUGE RPG fan before I was and one day I got money for my birthday and I went uptown and he came along . He saw Final Fantasy VII on the shelves and bugged me to get it . So I eventually got it but found he was playing it more than me . So when he was n't around , I sneaked and played his game and I got so wrapped up in the game I forgot I was still playing his game and he missed some plot elements . But I could n't contain myself cause this was one of the best games I played , and still do , I 'm currently on my 8th play.Story : Cloud , a former SOLDIER ( kind of like an elite squad ) member is recruited by Avalanche to help bring down the Shinra Corporation whose reactors are draining the planet of its energy . Where it goes from there involves a being from the sky , genetic experimentation and mind freak-outs.Music : Some of the best music ever is on the soundtrack . One track , Aeris 's Theme is worth the price of it alone . This song ca n't be put into words , one of the most beautiful compositions I 've ever listened to ( and it 's played in a sad scene but I wo n't spoil it ) . But this soundtrack also included a wide variety of music like rock ( Boss Battle Theme ) New age sounding ( City of the Ancients ) , funk like ( Wall Market ) to ominous ( Those Chosen By The Planet ) .Graphics : Back in 1997 , these graphics were jawdropping . That opening sequence with Aeris , the entrance to Gold Saucer , and awakening of ancient beings were just amazing . They seem tame now but back then , they were gorgeous . It is n't flawless though : the characters look `` blocky '' like it 'll have a big block for a hand and in some cases , you can see them without a mouth but it does n't detract from the feel of the game.And one thing to note if you 've have n't played a Final Fantasy before , yes it is Part VII but it 's not like a saga where each part is a continuation of the story . It 's all new story , characters , villains , worlds etc.For your spells and abilities , it includes the Materia System . While I 'm not gon na spoil what a materia is , the basic function of it is to give you special abilities . Equip it on your weapon or armor and you can cast magic , summon beasts , counterattack , steal or give you some benefits . Master it and it 'll create a new one . So awesome materia like Ultima , Knights of the Round or Mime can be replicated , giving you almost an endless string of summons.In VI and in VIII , certain special attacks can be accessed when a character was low health . Here it 's a bar that fills up whenever you get attacked . Fill it up and you can unleash a string of powerful attacks , one big beam , or even cure party members . One flaw is that regular attacks ca n't be accessed so you ca n't save it for an approaching Boss , you either have to use magic or just defend.This is one of the best games you 'll play and even though there 's other games out currently that can distract , it always helps to go back to what started it all : what brought people into the RPG genre in a HUGE way : Final Fantasy VII .	1
I HAVE PLAYED FINAL FANTASY VII EVERYDAY SINCE IT CAME OUT THOSE MANY YEARS AGO . I 'VE BEATEN IT COUNTLESS DOZENS OF TIMES AND THE ORGASMIC PLEASURE DERIVED FROM EVERY SECOND OF THIS DIVINE PIECE OF ART HAS YET TO DECREASE , IN FACT IT GETS GREATER . EVERY TIME I SELECT A NEW ATTACK , EVERY TIME I CLICK TO CONTINUE THE SPEECH TREE EVERY SECOND I WANDER ACROSS THE BEATIFUL AND BRILLIANT LANDSCAPE WAITING FOR YET ANOTHER TITILLATING RANDOM ENCOUNTER IS AN EXPERIENCE THAT I WILL TREASURE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE . YOU HAVE LIVED AND DIED IN VAIN IF YOU GO THROUGH YOUR LIFE WITH OUT EXPERIENCING THIS UNPARALELLED JOY.BUT THERE IS SO MUCH MORE THAN JUST JOY . THE FIRST TIME THAT AERIS DIED I I WAS SO STUNNED THAT I HAD A STROKE AND A HEART ATTACK SIMULTANEOUSLY WHILE VOMITING AND POOPING MYSELF , AS THE TEARS STREAMED DOWN MY FACE . IT WAS SO INTENSE THAT I PASSED OUT , AND SLIPPED INTO A COMA . FORTUNATELY , MY DEAR FRIENDS SET UP A PLAYSTATION IN MY ROOM AND PLACED THE CONTROLLER IN MY FLACID , COMATOSE HANDS ALLOWING ME TO CONTINUE THE GODLY ADVENTURE . THE SERENE YET POWERFUL , BEAUTIFUL YET FRIGHTENING MUSIC TURNED MY COMA DREAMS INTO JOYOUS VISIONS OF WONDER , WHICH MADE ME WISH NEVER TO AWAKE , WERE IT NOT FOR MY URGENT NEED TO COMPLETE THE MYSTIC QUEST.THE COMBAT IS A SPECTACULARLY INTENSE , CEREBRAL AFFAIR . THE EARTH-SHATTERING VISUAL EFFECTS AND SPELLS LEAVE ME WEAK AND NAUSEATED EVERY TIME , YET I CAN NOT , AND WILL NOT STOP , NO MATTER THE PRICE . WORDS COULD NOT ATTEMPT TO DO JUSTICE TO THE INTENSITY OF EVEN THE CALMEST FINAL FANTASY BATTLE.THE STORY IS LIKE NO OTHER , THE SPECTACULAR DIALOGUE IS AN EMULSIFICATION OF THE GREATEST ASPECTS OF SHAKESPEARE , CHAUCER , ELIOT , TENNYSON , DONNE , HOMER , MARLOW , PLATO , ARISTOTLE , HARDY , FAULKNER AND JOYCE ROLLED INTO A PACKAGE SO MALIFLUENT THAT EACH OF THESE GREAT WRITERS WOULD DESTROY THEIR WORK FROM SHAME . THE PLOT CREATES A RICH TAPESTRY OF JOY , WONDER , FEAR AND AWE THAT LEAVES MY HEAD SPINNING , MY HEART POUNDING , MY BOWELS CLENCHING , MY HAIR RAISED , MY STOMACH TURNING AND ROILING , MY KNEES SHAKING AND MY EXTREMITIES COLD AND SHIVERING , WHILE A JOYOUS PASSION STILL BURNS FROM WITHIN . THE CHARACTERS ARE UNIVERSAL ARCHETYPES OF EVERY MAN , WOMAN AND CHILD YET THEY ARE UTTERLY DISTINCT , UTTERLY ALIVE , CHILLINGLY REAL , LOVABLE AND EROTIC TO THE END . THE STOIC , HEROIC AND CHRIST-LIKE CLOUD STANDS AS A SYMBOL OF ALL THAT IS GOOD AND TRUE IN HUMANITY , EARTH AND ALL OF ETERNITY . THE LOVABLE , GRUFF 'N TUMBLE BARRET IS CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF THE INDOMITABLE NEGRO SPIRIT . AERIS IS A FRAIL FLOWER OF BEAUTY AND WONDER , A REPRESENTATION OF THE LOSS AND SACRIFICE THAT INEVITABLY OCCURS BEFORE ONE REACHES THE APEX OF TRUE ENLIGHTENMENT . SEPHIROTH IS AS BLACK AS THE DEEPEST PITS OF HELL , AN EMBODIMENT OF THE SATANIC , UNGODLY , BLASPHEMOUS AND PROFANE FORCES WHICH SEEK TO CRUSH THE FRAIL YET UNBENDING ROSE OF THE RIGHT . STILL , ONE AS MEEK AS I COULD N'T HOPE TO ANALYZE ALL THE INTRICACIES , METAPHORS , CHIASMAS ' , SIMILES , HYPERBOLES , ANALOGIES , FABLES AND PARABLES WHICH FILL UP THIS TEXT , WHICH IS EASILY THE DENSEST AND RICHEST OF ALL KNOWN HUMAN AND ALIEN LANGUAGES.ALL THE BEAUTY , TRUTH , MEANING , WONDER , SIGNIFICANCE AND INTEREST IN ALL THE WORLD ARE AS NOTHING ONCE YOU HAVE DISCOVERED THIS HIDDEN TREASURE . I FOR ONE WOULD TRADE ALL MY REMAINING DAYS FOR BUT ONE MORE MINUTE OF FINAL FANTASY VII INSPIRED PLEASURE , RATHER THAN BEING FORCED TO LIVE A HOLLOW , BITTER , JOYLESS EXISTENCE WITHOUT IT .	1
i got this game right when it came out in 1997. it was 49 $ then . and people were literaly fighting in line . when i took it home , i began to play , play , play , and play . i 've beat it 3 times and i still wan na go 'round a few more times . it 's a great game.ENJOY YOURSELF !	1
Ever since 1997 I got in the habit of beating this at least once a year . I love this game so much that I never get tired of playing it . There are very few games that I fall in love with and have to play over and over . Mass Effect , Heavy Rain , and Fable to name a few . The story is great , the characters are very memorable , and it has one of the best villains out of most of the games I 've played . At certain points in the game you actually feel there is no way you can win against a guy like Sephiroth and why bother.Yeah the graphics may be outdated and the characters may be blocky looking but that is no reason not to play this game . The story is great and kept me interested all the way to the end . If you like playing Final Fantasy but have n't tried any of the older ones , this is a great place to start . It 's a stand alone game and has nothing to do with the other ones ( even though it is the seventh game ) . I love it and still plan on beating it at least once a year for as long as I can .	1
The greatest FF is hands down IV . This game offers cutscenes and a story that will keep your eyes glued to the screen until you beat it . The characters are very enjoyable as well . The bosses can get a little tough , but if your a hardcore gamer , this should n't bother you at all . I highly recommend this game even if you are not a fan of the series . This game does take a long time to beat , but thats another positive thing this game has to offer , as do most FF games .	1
Lets face it people , this is the reason you bought a Playstation . Its the game that made me buy one . Although the game is not without its problems that are irritatingly noticble now ( a horrible translation , bad grammer , etc ) for its time this game was revolutionary . Square made great use of FMV technology to progress this very anime like story line . FF VII is one of three titles argued to be the best of them ( VI , VII and VIII ) , and is the game that started the RPG revolution that made Playstation what it is today.These days this game is sorely dated and this game should be remade using GCN technlogy . I do not believe that they should make it realistic . Idealy I 'd like to see them use toon shading in this remake idea to replace the 3D monstosities which were featured in the game originally . The original charcter models were inconsistant and largely overly blocky . However the battle scenes and major FMVs offered a whole lot of anime potential . This game needs to be toon shaded !	1
This game was a bit of a let down compared to its predacessor , Final Fantasy VI ( US III ) . It 's still a good game , the second best one from the three released for PS ( IX is the best of the PlayStation era ) . The dark realism pioneered by this game made for a good story , and was much more well done than Final Fantasy VIII . The addition of FMV for the first time was also a nice new element . However , the gameplay and story still fall short of Final Fantasy VI and IX . Worth a play , especially since the price is good now .	1
OH MY GOD ! I 've had this game for about 4 years now and it still kicks a** ! The plot is amazing and totally unique ( and never gets old ) The characters are dynamic and well done , the combat system is well thought out , and the magic system is much better than that of FFVIII . The only possible flaw with this game is the polygonal graphics , but when everything else is so amazing , WHO GIVES A F*** ? The story follows a rebel group known as AVALANCHE as they battle a large evil multinational corporation , but as they get closer to bringing it down , they soon realize the real fight for the safety of the world is still to come when a madman known as sephiroth ( the greatest villain ever concieved ) tries to summon forth a power that will destroy the planet , but amke him an all powerful being . Plot twists galore and about 70 hours of gameplay make this game an entirely different experience .	1
I will never get rid of my FF7 , I will hurt somebody who try 's to take my FF7 . Thank you for reading my review .	1
FF7 ... if you 've ever played this game , the words send shivers of delight down your spine . Squaresoft really outdid themselves with this one . The world 's in trouble thanks to a large corporation ( Shinra ) who is , basically , sucking the planet dry of its natural resources . Bummer . That 's where Cloud , Barrett , and Tifa ( oh , yeah , there 's this girl named Aeris ... hint : be nice to her at al times ) come in , equipped with HUGE swords , a Gun-Arm ( got ta get me one of those ) , and snazzy magic spells and fighting combos . The game is a marvel to play , and is clearly addictive . The gameplay is perfect , with tight controls which respond perfectly , an intuitive Materia ( Magic ) sysetm , and some kick ... bosses . ...	1
Probably one of the best games for RPG players . However , too expensive currently ( as of August 2006 ) . I bought the PC version and the Playstation version years back and still have them . The PC version does look better especially during fight scenes . Unfortunately , for use on Windows XP you have to get a software patch for later in the game ( chocobo race ) . Great great game . I would say 'shame on you ' to the sellers that are charging so much for the games but I understand their reasons.Find it cheap , buy it , play it , enjoy it !	1
I realized how much I sucked at RPG 's when I beat this game purely by chance but I still love it and think it 's one of the best games in the franchise . The graphics are horrible but being a game from 1997 , you ca n't really expect them to look much better than the Picasso cubic figures that they are . The animation scenes are fantastic though but that leads me to believe that had they gone to a four disc format like VIII , the gameplay graphics would have been enhanced a great deal . The story is great and just like the other FF titles , the underlying messages are pretty powerful as well . The Final Fantasy games do n't just serve an entertainment purpose but they also try to tell you about important things in the world and life.I hope Square Enix believes FFXV is a better game than VII so that it can finally be remade in HD . FFVII is a classic . Good luck trying to `` beat '' it . *crosses fingers*	1
According the the Guiness Book of Video Game Records , this game is in the top five best selling games for the Playstation 1 . That means that it is also the most common . So why why would this $ 10-15 game used jump to sky high prices ? I am guessing that the younger generation wants to see what all the hype was about and that the dvd based on this game did not hurt demand either ... Either way , the game is still awesome .	1
Released in 1997 , FFVII is considered one of the best RPG 's ever created . Here is my review on this masterpiece ! Graphics : 10/10 Now , a lot of the reviewers are complaining that the graphics bite , and thus giving it one star . What is wrong with gamers today ? All they care about is graphics , not gameplay . Back then , the graphics looked REVOLUTIONARY ! And do n't give me any of the `` Oh , they sucked even back then ! '' That 's not true . Just read the back of the box . Sure , the character designs on the field looked bad , but the battle graphics , backgrounds , and FMV 's make these look great ! Sound/music 10/10 Clash ! Bang ! Boom ! Lots of neat sound effects ! As for music , well the final boss music is the best piece of music ever . The heavy-metal boss theme is cool ! Story 10/10 I do n't know why everybody bashes this . It starts out simple , then turns complex with many twists and turns and a lot of character development.Gameplay 1000/10The game is LONG ! The battle system is AWESOME ! Lots of cool mani-games ! Chocobo-breeding ! Lots of swearing ! Tough optional bosses ! I could keep telling you about it , but I do n't wan na ! Ha ! Buy ? BUY ! BUY BUY ! This is one of the coolest games ! Best of all , it 's cheap . I can imangine , 100 years from now , everybody will still be talking about this game ! If you want a feast of music , graphics , gameplay , and spicy language , buy this ! EDIT : 12/01/05WTF 's with the Monster 's Inc. cover ?	1
This is it ! the best game of all time even ff8 ca n't stand over this game I did not like rpg 's tell I played this game there is no reason not to buy it ... well you might lose you'r job get kicked out of school lose you'r boy/girlfriend because you will do nothing but play this game ! and belive me or not I stayed up for a full week to play this game with only a 15 min brake every 5 hrs ! and I had my parants get me homeschool just so I could play this game more ! ! ! no I 'm not lieing ! BUY THE GAME ! ! !	1
Final Fantasy VII was a major hit in 1997 it was also the first final fantasy game not to be on a Nintendo console . This game has gone on to be without a doubt the most popular final fantasy game if not the most popular jrpg game ever made , and with good reason.If I had any complaints about this game its the fact that the graphics while amazing back in 1997 look a bit dated in 2014 which while some of the other final fantasys might look a little jagged around the edges but the have aged better . Which is n't the games fought or nothing given that company 's where still getting the foot on the ground in the whole 3d fad in 1997 , but it might turn off other players . Everyone kinda has a legoie look to them . In the battle scenes however are really detailed and graphically hold up today . Now for the music 90 % of the games soundtrack is amazing for a psx game its highly catchy and without the music I doubt the game would have been quite as popular as it is today . With that being said there is a few tracks in the game that are hard to listen to but most of it is great.Of Coarse the important part about final fantasy is the story and game play . The story without giving out any spoilers for the few that have n't played it yet , in this game is probably the best we will be able to see in a video game ( besides final fantasy 6 and maybe star wars knights of the old republic ) . What I like about the earlier final fantasy games is that its kinda like reading a book only that your playing and immersed into it . So with that being said I actually preferred this over the newer ones with the voice acting . If your a younger gamer or have kids the may have a hard time getting into a final fantasy game until the have reached the age the can read and perhaps this game can even help them learn or want to learn how to read . Also for newcomers of the series you do not need to play any of the previous final fantasy 's to understand the story . Most Final Fantasy 's with the exception of the ons that have -2 on them have nothing to do with one another story wise other than a few minor references here and there so if you just want to play one final fantasy you are invited to do that.Game play wise this game is very similar to the previous final fantasys IV-VI with the active time battle . This makes the battles a lot more fun as you can not scroll threw everything all day and get a shower before you make your move . With that being said you do have some time before making a move but you do have to be careful . Anyway this is on of the more easier final fantasys although it is still challenging none of the final fantasys ( while maybe 13 ) are casual friendly and this is no different there is a learning curve however if you do n't play games much and are sucked into this on you will learn it eventually . Just might have to start over a time or to.Anyway believe it or not despite popular believe this is not the best final fantasy game . Now it is on of the best and is the best final fantasy game to get started with since its slightly easier but I would recommend playing threw Final Fantasy VI as well since after beating VII I discovered more games in the series and found that this game was a lot more fun although similar plus the story of that game completely sucks you in even more than VII does . Along with the soundtrack of VI is just as great if not better.Anyway even though VI is a better game , although a bit more hardcore . VII is still a great follow up for that game and was the game that got me hooked in the series ( although I did played the first on on the old nes back in the day ) and is on of the best RPGs ever made anyone into rpgs both western and Japanese ones will be happy with this game as long as there willing to sit threw the outdated graphics , they will find a very fun and likable game with great characters ( although this is somewhat where final fantasy started going to stereotypical anime people ) and a great story .	1
In my opinion , this is the greatest Playstation game ever released . The storyline is intense , and profusely in-depth and really grasps you into the storyline , which revolves around many characters instead of one . The music is beautiful and many times envokes emotions during parts of the game , this game , in my opinion , has the greatest musical score . I have noticed people complain about this games graphics , well if you have a problem with graphics in an RPG ... then I have to say , your intellectual level is very low . First of all , this game 's graphics are fine , even compared to the graphics of more recent video game titles ... and the game does Not revolve around its graphics.There are many other factors that seperate this game from other RPGs . This game also has the best story in a video game title to date , and there are situations that occur during the game that add to the story perfectly . If you want a solid , and deep RPG , this is for you .	1

This game is a three disc rpg turn based game with the best storyline of it 's time . It revolutionized gaming . It literally has weeks worth of playtime value being that you could sit down and play it for weeks on end straight through , non stop and still not do everything there is to do . I absolutely love this game . You find yourself spending so much time playing the characters , that you ca n't help but care about what happens next , which is a big kudos to the writers at SquareSoft no SquareEnix . They really know their stuff . I 'm not going to say what the game is about , on the off chance that you 've never played it . I would want to spoil it . I will say be prepared for long hours and late night snacks . I do n't recommend this to anyone who works long hours at a job or around heavy machinery . You tend to daze off thinking about the game when you are n't playing .	1
I must say , this game is great.I have written another review for this game , but i didnt feel it was completey correct.One thing was it is confusing and I cant say its for everyone , i say this because if you dont like FF and you havent tried FF before dont start here.The game is fun , but not good graphics , and its confusing.Yu may not like this game , I warn you .	1
It 's been called everything from the greatest game of all time to the undeniable peak of an already legendary series . It 's a big part of the reason Sony overtook Nintendo and ultimately won the 64-bit chapter of the console wars . And , truth be told , it 's single handedly responsible for reviving a passion for video games that had lain dormant within me for years . So , cutting to the chase , is it worth the hype , does it really measure up to those previously mentioned , simplistic , cherished classics of the 8-bit era , can it really be as good as it 's been portrayed ? Well , yes and no . Final Fantasy VII is not the best game I 've ever played , period . What it is ... well , it 's easily in the top five.The story basically throws players into the fast lane right off the bat . The opening video montage leads directly into a late-night raid on the planet 's largest governing body , the Shinra , a raid in which the player is actively a part . As events unfold , the point becomes clear ; you 're a mercenary , aiding a terrorist organization in their efforts to destroy a significant portion of the city to make a point that the Shinra can not ignore . Five minutes into the game and already it 's covered more mature material than the previous six combined . Make no mistake , Final Fantasy VII is not a game you 'll want to hand your six year old to help him pass some time in front of the TV . Not only does it cover some rough psychological terrain ( mortality , semitism , terrorism and political espionage are discussed , in depth , and confronted ... just to name a few ) but the characters and dialog themselves are n't nearly as squeaky clean as they were in previous installments.With that said , the in-game visuals of FF7 are very much lacking , especially in comparison to later titles . This was obviously a very early release for the rugged PSone . Edges were extremely jaggedy , especially so when not in a battle , live renderings of the characters left a lot to be desired and even the cutscenes themselves were compressed poorly , leaving huge artifacts all over the glorious video renderings . In sharp contrast , though , the animation and design of the hundreds of different enemies , players , items and boss characters is amazing , and the variety of static , immovable backgrounds are superbly concepted , executed and presented.To a much lesser degree than the visuals , the musical score is undermined by the medium in which it 's been presented . This is a soundtrack that would have shaken the earth if it were performed by a master orchestra . Unfortunately , the difference between a symphonic performance of these classic songs and the spotty , digitized portrayal that shipped with FF7 is as large as the difference between the sketches of the characters themselves and their eventual presentation on-screen . Sure , you 'll recognize them without a second glance ... but they 've been crammed into a format that really ca n't do them any justice.As has been the case with each new chapter in the Final Fantasy legacy , one new tweak has been thrown into the mix , in this case going under the name & quot ; materia. & quot ; As the game progresses , you 'll find these colorful blocks of concentrated energy ( be it on the body of a defeated enemy , alone in a cave somewhere or for sale in a shop ) that grant the holder magical abilities . They 're the only way to upgrade your characters ' abilities , and are completely interchangeable between the members of your party . By equipping a block of materia and then defeating enemies , the magic & quot ; levels up & quot ; and gains new abilities while simultaneously strengthening its previous benefits . Each weapon and bit of armor you find throughout the game has a slot for the employment of materia , which effectively limits the number of them you can use at any one time . You 'll eventually need to make some tough choices over which materia to develop and which to ignore.A lot of players have voiced a strong dislike for the materia system , claiming it kills the variety of your characters . The common consensus says that by giving the player the ability to assign any skill or spell to any character , Square has basically given you a bunch of clones with which to do battle . I 'd have to disagree . If you really want to nitpick and pay attention to the specifics of each character 's stats like that , you 'll notice that each character has a different affinity to the various materia commands in the world . Sure , you can give anybody in your party the ability to cast & quot ; fire , & quot ; but it 's going to cause more damage if you give it to someone with an inherently high magic ability . Square 's kept the variety in this cast , they 've simply given you the ability to ignore each character 's strengths and sculpt an army on your own accord.The theory behind Final Fantasy VII is outstanding , yet simple : create a game with an untouchable story , tremendous characters , amazing design , mouth watering special effects and great musical accompaniment . It was the right game with the right pop culture appeal at the right moment . It accomplished every single one of its goals , and it 's going to win & quot ; best video game ever & quot ; polls from now until the end of time because of it . What it wo n't win , though , is a perfect ten from yours truly . While I 'd be more than happy to go so far as to say the story contained herein is the best of all the Final Fantasy games , I ca n't say the same for most of the other aspects of the game . The visuals and audibles are hampered by the PSone 's own internal limitations , the characters are topped by those of FF8 , and the mini games make me shake my head more than they entertain me . This is very , VERY close to perfection , but I 've admittedly played a few titles that are better	1
... ... that has n't already been said a million times by a million people . The game is that good , it has without question earned it 's place among the top 2 or 3 all time RPG 's to date . I played many before and hundreds since and this is the only game that had me invested enough in a character and a story line that when that character died I dropped my controller in shock and a small tear may have found it 's way down my cheek . It 's a game that , especially at the time of it 's release was just that good . If you have had enough interest you found yourself already at this page and remarkably reading my humble review than all I can tell you is ... .STOP READING NOW AND GO BUY IT ... ... .it is just that damn good . Beware on price though . An original black label version can top $ 100 in auctions if collecting is your thing , avoid the scammer 's asking hundred 's . Depending on current market $ 85 to $ 125 are about right for the black label one 's . If you just want to play it and collecting is n't for you the greatest hits version is more reasonable at $ 25 to $ 40 , it 's the same game either way and the greatest hits one is a steal in terms of entertainment value .	1
This is a really good game , but it 's aimed more at rpg lovers than at hardcore gamers . If you are one of those people who simply wo n't buy anything with a E rating , you probably wo n't like this game . There 's nothing obscene about this game except for some minor swearing and sexually suggestive scenes ( no actual nudity ) . This is not a game to be rushed through at high speeds . To fully enjoy this game , you should delve deep into the hidden aspects of this world and learn more about the story as well as obtaining useful items . Many people are spitting on FFVIII and FFIX , because of this game . In my opinion , FFVII is better only by a very , very , slight margin.Also , I think that there definitely were better games during the time period in which this game came out . Zelda Ocarina of Time was definitely better than FFVII , even though it was shorter , and the revolutionary Goldeneye for N64 is just as good as FFVII.Do n't let those comparisons prevent you from buying this game though . In an industry with so many good games to buy , comparison will really get into the way of buying an enjoyable game . Buy this before buying FFVIII and FFIX , because it 's much easier to learn and it will be a nice introduction to how final fantasies on PS work .	1
The game is awesome . The story is memorable , almost all of the characters are likable and the game basically becomes more fun as you get closer to the end .	1
It two words BUY IT.While that alone should be enough , I guess I 'll tell you why.This is THE greatest game EVER made . It surpasses the mighty Metal Gear Solid , commonly thought to be the greatest , by a million miles . It also wastes any other FF , RPG , Game , Movie , Book , anything ! I 've finished it nine times . I 'm yet to be bored . I reckon I never will be ... ..	1
This is my second time playing Final Fantasy VII , and I forgot how perfect it was . Everything about this story had such a nostalgic feeling to it . I am really glad I got to replay this game , and I hope all gamers give this game a chance.Pros1 . The story and the soundtrack are awesome . I really enjoyed the soundtrack this time more then last time because I guess I am older and I feel what the music is expressing with the characters , and the mood of the situation as well.2 . The boss fights are fair in this game , but I forgot how hard chocobo breeding is lol . I also forgot how hard the ruby and emerald weapon were in this game.3 . I actually like Aeris the most in this game . I loved her goofy and flirty personality in this game . She became my favorite character in this game , and then I would say Nanki was my second favorite lol.Cons1 . The graphics are dated , but a good story comes before great graphics . Final Fantasy XIII is prime example of great graphics and a terrible story . A great story is more important.Overall this is great game to pick up again just to see your favorite FF characters : ) . Anybody new to the series I recommend playing this one first or FF 12.Game On .	1
I have played Final Fantasy 9 , and although I liked the game overall -- I also gave it 5 stars -- I like Final Fantasy 7 much , much better . From the moment you pop the first CD in , you are nothing but impressed . I wish all games started out the way this one does -- with a BANG ! You are Cloud , a selfish newcomer to a resistance group known as AVALANCHE . You do n't care about the planet . No way . As soon as this job is done , you want to get your cut and split . The dialogue is truly something else . And the storyline , WOW ! The whole idea of a city on a & quot ; plate & quot ; was really original and appealing . Great movie-sequences . I could go on and on praising this game . Even after playing Final Fantasy 9 I ca n't help but go back and play this great game . Yeah , it is more science fiction than fantasy , but it is science fiction done RIGHT . Although the game is only three CD 's long , the game lasts anywhere from 40 to 80 hours . In the first CD , you spend 6 hours in the huge city of Midgar alone . Then you go on for another 10 hours or so , before going to disc 2 . This game has great music , especially the ending boss music . That song is called & quot ; One-Winged Angel & quot ; . By the way , Sephiroth is pronounced , & quot ; Sea-fee-roth & quot ; . At least that 's how they pronounce it in the song . Speaking of Sephiroth , he 's really cool . Definitely the best villian I 've ever seen . Overall , this is either the first or second best RPG I 've ever played . First place might go to Final Fantasy 6 . Sure , the graphics are way outdated on that game , but the storyline more than made up for it . Anyway , buy Final Fantasy 7 RIGHT NOW .	1
This is one of the most wonderful games ever ! It has a great story and really cool characters ! This game is really exciting ! This is an unforgettable game and I recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a totally awesome RPG !	1
This is the best RPG ever . That just involves you the player . Other people will argue that diablo or warcraft are superior . This game offers you a minnimum of 60 hour of game play . Lot of side quests . Great story line . And you wo n't have to divorce your significant other over it , because you 're playin with some kid on the other side of the country you do n't know . Graphics are about the best for the era from which the game came from . If you are lookning for a good RPG with a good story , this is it . I 've had my copy for 15 years . Ever 5 years or so I just get an itch to play it again .	1
I can 's say enough about Final Fantasy VII . Even though it is no longer on the cutting edge of RPG games , it is still one of the best . The story is very complex and flows very smoothly . The game system is great . The materia system really works well to customize the game somewhat by specializing weapons and armours . Replay value is high because it 's very intersting to see the different characters . This is definitely a time-sucking game . I 've played for hours trying to breed Chocobos just to see what 's in some of the & quot ; unreachable & quot ; places . If you own a PlayStation , you should own Final Fantasy VII .	1
The world of Final Fantasy VII is waiting to be explored ; only question is , are you ready for it ? You play as Cloud , the serious male protagonist , who can not remember much about his past ( due to the injection of Jenova cells.. and the fact that he 's a would-be Sephiroth clone ) . Cloud 's adventures take him to many wonderful sites ; you have the Gold Saucer , his home-town with beautiful but creep mountains , and even the Temple of the Ancients.Players will be kept hooked until the finale as Meteor crashes down upon earth . The only real turn-off to those who have n't played it yet is the graphics , but think of this ; Final Fantasy VII was made in 1997 , so the beauty of VIII and IX were but a dream.Play it if you have n't already . You wo n't be disappointed .	1
Let me just break this game down step by step.Storyline : Very good and very easy to follow . I like how it separates between Shinra and Sephiroth before the first disk is even half way over . Very addicting and very fun to follow , and it still always gets me going without ever getting old.Graphics:10 years ago these graphics were considered `` best of all time '' .10 years later , we ask ourselves 'What the heck is this crap ? 'One thing that never gets old is the fact that these poorly drawn 3D characters are unequally proportioned . Huge hands , twig arms ? No mouths or noses , and yet they have huge hair ? In 2007 all I can think of is to thank whoever came up with REAL 3D graphics.Characters : Each has their own special personality that I love . Barrett being my favorite . His attitude and swearing habits are possibly the funniest thing in the game . I usually keep him in my party just for that reason . Cloud is stubborn , but not as funny . Tifa 's got that hair thing going ( like I just mentioned ) . Aeris is kind of boring and dies too early in the game to get to know her a lot more than you do . Red XII ... ..he 's a dog ? Cid , another character who ca n't control his mouth . Yuffie ... .some ninja girl that really serves no more meaning than a side quest . Vincent , amazing character who can morph into creatures . And Cait Sith ... .wait a minute , he 's a toy ? O.O ; ; ; Bosses : Each have their own difficulty which I like.Some require you to actually have trained or else face a brutal whipping . Final 3 bosses each have their own `` twang '' to them . Especially Sephiroth who is fun to go up against time and time again . I mean c'mon , who does n't like a cool character with a wing for an arm ? Music kind of gets to you though and his 5 minute Super Nova attack gets really frustrating when he does it about 10 times.I kind of wish there were more than 2 All-American Creature bosses thoughMagic : The whole materia thing is fun , except for the fact that it ruins your stats.Limit Breaks : Easy to use , hard to obtain.Playability : Very-HighI 've replayed this game time after time again without getting bored . I try new strategies and new characters each time and try to level up differently than I did before .	1
Although this game is frequently criticized for featuring `` angsty characters '' and a large number of anime and video game cliches , critics of this game 's plot should consider that fan perception of the originality of this game has been lessened considerably by the future inclusion of similar character and plot dynamics in the final fantasy series , particularly in FFVIII and FFX . This video game features truly incredible storytelling , and this game should be called cinematic not just because of the inclusion of FMV , but because of the large number of visual metaphors expressed in the game 's visual direction . Consider the parallel between the stars in the game 's opening and the sparks Aerith watches shooting out of the open electrical panel , or the fact that Midgar 's poor literally live underneath its rich . The low-polygon-count 3-D presentation of this game gives it a visual style which emphasizes the geometric nature of objects , and the producers of the game have changed a technical limitation into a stylistic enhancement . The game 's usage of light and dark , squalor and cleanliness , gloom and beauty , give it a literary theme of naturalism , by representing the products of human technology as ugly . The sweeping `` theme of Final Fantasy VII '' , which compliments the wide-open world map prior to the summoning of Meteor , is first hinted at in `` Holding my Thoughts in My Heart , '' which plays at the precipice of the dystopian technopolis of Midgar . The game 's various themes communicate the producers ' vision of which environments represent hell , and which represent heaven . Even the ironic real-life double-meaning of `` finding the promised land '' is parallelled in the game by Shinra 's misinterpretation of the religion of Aerith 's race . The game spends a lot of time exploring the identities of the characters of Cloud , Aerith , Tifa and Sephiroth through dreams , memories , and hallucinations , and rather than including definitive , conclusive scenes in which the whole truth of the characters are revealed , the game challenges you , much like a David Lynch film , to discover the reality of various events by logically reconciling the various perspectives from which they are viewed . This is `` angsty storytelling '' at its most beautiful , as it challenges the players to make an effort to understand the characters , much in the same ways that the game designers would probably like to see more interpersonal understanding within humanity.This game improved upon the limit breaks of FF6 , which could only be used by deliberately keeping the characters at dangerously low HP levels , by adding the limit bar , and the barrier and mbarrier bars also made combat more interesting , leading many players to wonder why they were subsequently removed from the series . Some minor design flaws in this game include the three-character limit in battle , which reduces the player 's ability to diversify the roles of the heroes , and leads the player , on a logical level , to wonder why the other heroes are unable to participate . Also , the overavailability of gil makes purchasing weapons and items too easy , and minimalizes the usefulness of alternate methods for party growth , such as stealing weapons and items.If the battles as a whole seem too easy in this game , it is because the game was designed with the intention of challenging the player to experience it , rather than challenging the player to get through it . The game is filled with a variety of fun methods for winning battles , from high-powered summons to enemy skills , and some otherwise difficult boss battles become unloseable after equipping a specific accessory . Part of the coolness of this game is the fact that it was the first major RPG to allow the players to develop extremely poweful heroes , by combining abilities such as auto-resurrection , auto-haste , multiple counter attacks , mp absorbtion , and much more . In other words , the lack of challenge is largely deliberate , and designed to give the players freedom to choose which resources to throw at a particular battle , rather than forcing the players to throw everything they have at most battles in order to have a chance for victory . The inessential-but-fun nature of the sidegames , such as snowboarding and chocobo-breeding , mirrors the inessential-but-fun nature of the majority of the special abilities in this game which may be used during battle.FF VII must also be commended for the distinctively unique visual design of every dungeon and section of the map . Walking on the snowy north continent of the overworld , leaving footprints in the snow , feels completely different than walking in the shadow of Midgar , and getting lost in previously-unexplored environments , such as the chaotically-mapped Great Glacier , is more of a pleasure than an annoyance . Experimenting with different characters and weapons is fun in this game , and this is complimented by visual touches which were unique to this game at the time of its release , such as showing a different weapon in the battle character model 's hand , depending on what is equipped.I played FFI , FFIV , and FFVI before this game , and on my first playthrough of FFVII , I mourned the absence of some elements included in FFVI , such as multi-party battles , and FFVI 's non-linear second act , but in time , I came to realize that in terms of characterization and presentation , FFVII is the quintessential Final Fantasy game .	1
Can it get any better ? Yes , but only with FFX ! ! I love RPG games , and I 've owened all the FF games from FFV and on ( the previous ones were n't that great , in my opinion ) .Those of my friends who do n't like playing the game have always wanted me to let them know when I 'm playing it so they can watch ! ! Imagine your family watching the game with you instead of nagging you to & quot ; stop playing & quot ; and get a life ( ? ! ) .	1
Seriously , it 's 2008 , why am I reviewing this game so long after it came out ? Well , because I want to . So there . Anyway , this game is marvelous ; I still replay it every once in awhile , and it never gets old for me . You 'd think I 'd get sick of it after awhile , but I notice and appreciate something new each time I play it . I personally think this game has aged pretty well , and I 'll continue to play it until my discs break in half . Warning : This review can be considered to contain SPOILERS ! ( Well , mostly just in the `` story '' section ) .Graphics ( 10/10 ) : Well , by today 's standards , the graphics are n't so good . However , for their time , they deserved a 10 out of 10 . There 's something about seeing a character in 3-D ( albeit rather blocky 3-D ) that helps you identify more easily with the characters , and even though we now have such advanced graphics with current gen systems , I still find FF7 completely playable and not too hard on the eyes.Music ( 10/10 ) : What can I say ? The music in this game is both evocative and distinctive . The music fits the scenes and conveys mood very well . This is especially true of the overworld music-I feel like the world really is in dire straights whenever I hear it . And let me tell you , the first time I heard One-Winged Angel , it put the fear in me ( consequently , I died and had to try again - ha ha ! ) . Anyway , I loved this game 's music so much I had to buy the soundtrack ! Characters ( 10/10 ) : Wow . Characters are excellently portrayed ; they all have personalities and some kind of backstory . Even Yuffie . I mean , after playing a certain recent FF ( 12 , cough ) , I 've really come to appreciate the fact that no character in FF7 is just tacked on to the party ( cough , FF12 's Penelo , cough ) . Every single character has a backstory that 's relevant or ties into the main story in some way.Story ( 10/10 ) : Wow . That 's all I can say . FF7 has an amazing intricate network of subplots and character histories on top of the main story . I love the complexity of it . However , the one drawback to this complex story is that it requires multiple playthroughs and some thought before you catch everything . To me though , this makes the game better , not worse . Also , the pacing of the story is excellent . I never felt bored or compelled to continue `` just to reach the end '' .Plus , I love the fact that your main character , Cloud , has a flawed memory ( spoiler , I know , but who does n't know the story of FF7 by now ? ) . Because you see the events of the game through his eyes , you never quite know what actually happened , and what is the product of his confusion . I believe that having a less than 100 % reliable narrator makes for a much more interesting story for the player because it keeps you guessing . Loads of RPGs feature narrators/main characters with some sort of amnesia , but this is one of the few games I 've seen that that actually puts a large focus on `` unreliable narration '' . Some people have complained that FF7 's story is confusing and poorly told , but I strongly disagree . Stories in literature that feature `` unreliable narration '' ( Edgar Allen Poe used this alot ; he does n't catch any flak for it ! ) are completely legitimate ways of telling a story . In the case of Final Fantasy 7 , it serves to let the player know ( in a dynamic and creative way ) that Cloud is possibly psychologically unstable . If you pay attention to the game ( you might need multiple playthroughs to catch it ) , you can figure out what 's really going on . This is in direct contrast to a game that just has a crap story and does n't make any sense because of poor writing ( for an example of this sort of game , see my Grandia III review ) .Battle System ( 10/10 ) : Once again , I have no complaints here . I absolutely love menu-driven combat ( I know you all are going to laugh at me , but I ca n't be the only one who likes turn-based stuff ) . I love the materia system-it allows for some good customization , which I enjoyed . In many ways , the materia system is awesome because it allows you to use any character to do anything , which means that no one character is so worthless that you just never use them ( with the possible exception of Aeris , since her attack is so low ) .Gameplay ( 10/10 ) : This is my catch-all category . The game is just chock full of extras and side-quests . Plenty to explore and accomplish . The side-quests are a good balance of combat related things ( like destroying the Weapon monsters ) and more relaxing non-combat things ( like racing and breeding chocobos ) . The controls are easy to use and are rather intuitive . I really have no complaints.Overall ( 10/10 ) : NOTE this score is not an average , it 's my subjective overall score . Personally , I can not recommend this game enough . I realize that it looks rather dated by today 's standards , but it 's what 's inside that counts , right ? The core of this game is still gold . FF7 is like a fine piece of literature-it may be old but it 's still a classic .	1
There is very little about this game that ca n't be enjoyed . Because of that simple statement and resident fact , the game has become an absolute joy and cultural icon in the gaming world . If you 've gamed , you 've heard about FFVII , if you 've played Final Fantasies before , you 've most likely been inundated with information about this FF . Ten to one , you 've probably played it . Over and over and over again . And for good reason.If you 're a stickler for graphics , this is not your game . True , there are patches for the computer version that makes the graphics of the characters a bit more bearable , but half the charm is the ludicrously sharp angles and style that was just pulling out of 16-bit gaming . The cut scenes , for its time , were remarkable and had blown our young minds away all those years ago . Now , however , it pales in comparison to what is being put out on next gen software . Still , if you can look past the blocky animation the game will still blow your mind.It 's a game that you actually , go figure , have to WORK at . The easiest route is not always the most accessible and you 'll spend a lot of time bashing poor Cloud , the main character , into walls trying to find the damn door . On top of that , you have to battle beasts that are n't going to level up or down with you to present a challenge . They are what they are and if you ca n't beat them you better be ready to run around the world a couple hundred times leveling yourself and your characters . But , the upside to that is the convenience of crap to do ! There 's a whole world of mini games and side quests that take up a majority of your time and energy . The main story is captivating and you wish to see it to its conclusion , but at the same time Gold Saucer and Chocobo Breeding might very well make you into an addict . This makes the game , in the later hours , a bit easy to beat since you might very well grab every summon and every materia known to the Planet , which will make your characters into walking , talking nuclear bombs without the fallout.The characters are all very rounded and all have a depth of story to them that is very typical of Final Fantasy , but they are not loosely connected by coincidence , but rather a drive to see the world saved . Their reasons are all unique to them and it makes the story as believable as any since we all know what it 's like to be part of a group that stands for something , even if it 's something small . The antagonist is just as round . Sephiroth is as complicated as the rest and will present quite a challenge to you as you progress through the game.There were many breakthroughs with this game that helped to pave the road for future FFs and separate future RPGs , but it makes it no less fun to play because it 's so called `` old '' or `` outdated '' . A definite gem , worth the time and effort , and all kinds of fun .	1
very expensive , but this game is worth it . for anyone looking to buy it know that the ps3 has it as an available download for like 10 bucks . ya its no on a cd like you remeber , but hey it saves you some cash . this game is great its a must have game for any true rpg gammer .	1
This game is ahead of its time , always something to learn , always adventure to enjoy . I highly endorse this game . It is one of a kind , a classic .	1
This game was truely ground breaking for its time . I ca n't think of a single RPG for a game console that had so much depth with character development , story and optional side quests as this . The graphics and sound were phenominal in their day . Any RPG or FF fan should give this game a shot ! Recommended party : Cloud , Cid and Barret ; you 'll be laughing like crazy !	1
No RPG has come close to having the kind of stories and atmosphere that the Final Fantasy series has . But no Final Fantasy game has come close to the timeless masterpiece of Final Fantasy VII . The characters are superb ! I will never forget Cloud , Aeris , Tifa , Barrett , Cid ( Highwind ) and the others . The story is incredible and the music is classic ! Sure , the sound and graphics do n't measure up to PS2 , Xbox or Gamecube . But this game is above all that . Video games have never left as deep an impression on me like this one has . This is THE defining title in the Final Fantasy series .	1
I do n't even know where to begin . This is the game that made me want a PlayStation in the first place . The story ... .jeez , it 's better than most books . It has so much , so many twists , and lots of unexpected surprises , that once you finish this great game , you 'll feel proud of yourself , and you 'll go to everyone and say & quot ; I JUST BEAT FINAL FANTASY 7 ! YES ! & quot ; It 's that good . The FMV is excellent , I would n't expect anything else for Sqaresoft , and the music fits the mood . The in-game graphics could use some work . They have blocks for hands and have no mouths , but it 's the graphics are not THAT important . With battle , do n't expect this to be a shooter or anything , the battle system is called Turned based . That means that each character has a meeter , and when it fills up , they can attack , cast magic , summon a monster , or whatever . One annoying thing about battles , is that when you walk around , there are too many random battles . One fun thing to do is equiping weapons , armor , and materia . Materia is the magic get to use . It 's also the summons . The game world is HUGE . It is . And there is so much to do , that the list is nameless , and it 's just like a real world . There is also a place where you can breed chocobos , they are giant birds . Doing this takes a long time , but it 's very rewarding . THat 's just one of the things you can do . Trust me , GET THIS GAME !	1
This is the `` must-have '' of the series . Skip VIII , get IX and X , and throw yourself into the mists of time to rekindle that old flame called Final Fantasy VII . This game brought the non-hardcore gamers and hardcore gamers together . ( much like Star Trek IV did with non trekkies , trekkers ... ) The CG effects left a mark on the people who played it and introduced Final Fantasy to the mainstream . I never played any FF before this and was n't the least bit interested , but , I tried it ... the rest is history . The Statue of Mario was replaced in '97 . One last thing , do n't let the release year fool you ... VII stands as outstanding graphically as it did then and weaves a tale that will still amaze ...	1
This is definetly one of the greatest games ever made- but remember its gotten quite old now , and for diehard RPG fans this game is not that great .	1
Ok ... This game is way way way too under-rated ! ! ! What 's wrong with everyone . I know the graphics are not as good as any later RPG games . But does that really matter that much ? ! he storyline is an absolute kick , too . I ca n't believe some people do n't like it ! Yeah , it might be a little confusing at first , but as you put yourself in the game , it really gets much better ! The good thing about this game is that you can have many different choices and events going on everytime you play it . Choose different options the second time you play it and you can get different responses and items ! I 'm not gon na say this game is the best b/c everyone has different opinions , but this game is really a great RPG kick ! And all you people who do not agree with me , try to stop comparing this game to all these other new RPGs and the later Final Fantasies that has like perfect graphics and other advanced techs . View this game as a whole new RPG that you have never heard or thought about , then maybe you will start to appreciate the beauty of it . This is really a great game , I will never regret buying this RPG ! ! ! And I do n't know if you noticed , but check the other reviews , many of the reviewers do not know how to use the ratings and gave it 1 star or 0 stars when they actually intend to give it full stars ! ! ! So this game is really greater than its rating ! ! !	1
After being on the SNES for a number of years , Nintendo and Squaresoft split up and Square created its own game console , the Playstation . And FF7 just might be the best game ever made for it . FF7 defined what an RPG should be , with an intricate storyline , characters with attitude , an addictive battle system , and everything else that makes an RPG worth playing . This is what RPGs should look , play , and feel like , but it seems like none are as good as this one . The action starts from the very beginning , starting with a terrorist group called AVALANCHE on their way to destroy a power plant called a Mako Reactor , which sucks the life out of the planet in order to provide the people of the city Midgar with electricity . These Reactors are spread across the world , and AVALANCHE 's main goal is to destroy all of them to save the planet . However , a creation of the Shinra , Inc. company has come back to haunt them : a humanoid creature named Sephiroth , who takes his Mako-filled disfigured mother to find the Promised Land and destroy the planet . Then , Cloud , a shallow character with a mysterious past , and his team must pursue Sephiroth in order to save the planet . The storyline then gets even more exciting as other problems arise , but you 'll have to play to figure it out . A good RPG for any game fan , this is something you 'll have to play to believe.Overall : 9/10Music : 8/10Storyline : 9.5/10Characters : 9/10Replay Value : 9/10	1
The greatness of this game does n't have to be typed . If you 've been living under a rock for the past 20 years , let me tell you this game is quite possibly the best in history . New RPG fans must try this classic . This game could play on PS3 .	1
When it comes to an RPG , none can top Final Fantasy . With quests galore , a great story , amazing visuals ( considering the time period ) , and customization that is pretty respectable it still can hold its own against games today . There are even multiple optional characters ! ( Yuffie and Vincent ) . For anyone interested in gaming and RPGs this game is a must without a doubt .	1
This game was my first RPG back in the day . I absolutely loved it . I really would love to play it again , and I 'm sure this game is overhyped for many that did n't play it back in the day . This game had charm , great CG cutscenes , and it totally captured me in the last few hours . Some say it would n't hold up by today 's standards , and maybe not . But I would love to play it again someday ( maybe on PSN ) and would love even more a remake done in HD.I 've been an RPG fan ever since .	1
I think that this is the greatest game ever done by Squaresoft . I say the Weapons were the best part besides the cool equip weapons like speacials ( Ultimate Weapons ) or Summons were also pretty cool . I spent many hours on this game but still I never got all the things . I think the most funnest part of it was finding or buying things you neede . The battles were pretty fun too . John	1
I heard people say this game sucks because they say the story is stupid , but they do n't understand how good of a game this was in its time , it was a masterpiece and if you can find a place to buy it from DO NOT resell it this game will be hard to find in the future so its only good to buy it and keep it as a collectors item !	1
This is arguably the greatest Final Fantasy game of all time . Some of the best heroes , villans , story line , and character dynamic in video game history.Product arrived as described and on time .	1
All `` cloud 's giant sword '' jokes aside , this game has one of the most loyal fanbase in gaming.Is it worthy of all the fanfare ? Well , i do n't thing it 's worthy of rabid fanboyism and a 200 dollor price range , but it is a damn good game.Dispensing with my usual `` the good , the bad , and the meh . '' format . let 's do a rundown by detail.Graphics : It is a real mixed bag.The character models out of battle look ridiculous out of battle and pretty nice in battle.the backgrounds range to beautifully picturesque to `` let 's see how much brown we can get away with . '' The cutscenes are pretty epic . *SPOILER ALERT*The high points to me were the opening , the shinra building getting blown up and part of midgar callapsing onto a section of the slums . *okay you can look now*The gameplay : No real suprises really , aside from it including an active time battle system.Minigames : They are actually pretty neat and they give you lots of incentive to do them . ( maybe a little too much incentive actually , seeing how one of them is the only place to get Omnislash . ) My favorite being the chocobo farming and racing.The story : Well , pretty good , but i think FF VI and IV did it better tbh.Most of the game is traveling around the world chasing the big bad while avoiding or fighting the other big bad ( shrinra ) and unraveling the past.oh , and there 's this really weird scene in wall-market ... The music : Here 's where the game REALLY shines , giving us some of the most memorable tunes in video games.Just listen to One winged angel , Now THAT is what death sounds like ! ( albeit kinda a Jaw 's theme rip-off ) Cosmo Canyon 's theme is amazing.The shinra theme stands out to me to.Music is subjective though so you may hate it.The characters : Cloud : For most of the game , he 's a pretentious douchebag , but he lightens up a bit near the end.Barret : He is Mr T. ( I guess someone at square really liked the A-team . ) Tifa : Sweet , good-natured girl who is n't afraid to fist fight godzilla . ( kinda awesome . ) oh , and she has a thing for cloud , for some reason . Speaking of that ... Aerith : The obligatory love interest.Red XIII : He 's a lion that talks . He 's the most level headed.Cid : A washed up , foul mouth old pilot/technician ( my favorite . ) Vincent : He 's a shapeshifting vampire and he 's kinda sad about it.His past happens to be kinda messed up ... he 's even sadder about that.Yuffie : Was the lolita ninja a trope before this girl ? Cait Sith : I really do n't remember many details about this thing beside that he 's a robot controlled by Reeve , a shinra employee.I 'd go over the antogonist but i do n't want this review/retrospectic go be much longer.So , if these character 's sound cool to you then great ! If you like this game then check out , Legend of Dragoon , by the way.If you are a collector with a lot of money to blow then get this .	1
For me this was my first Final Fantasy experience and I am proud to say this is not only one of my favorite Final Fantasy 's its also one of my most favorite rpg 's . I do n't give VII 5 stars because its the first final fantasy game I played , I give it 5 stars because it truly is an amazing roller coaster of excitement , emotion and even add humor into the mix as well as not being just kid friendly . Not only that but it has the one of the most memorable vilians if not the most memorable one , Sephiroth.Storyline : In VII you play as Cloud Strife a mercenary for hire . As the game begins you are thrust into battle immediately as you have joined up with a rebel ( or terrorist , if you will ) group called Avolanche , who either its members or supporters needs to learn how to spell , to blow up a Shinra reactor in the city of Midgar . Shinra is a corporation that is sucking the energy , called Mako , out of the planet which is slowly killing the planet . After this job and the next you end up joining Avolanche and pretty much becoming the leader of the group taking over Barret 's spot . As the story progresses you find out you were a member of a group called Soldier , Shinra 's elite soldiers , and befriending the main villian Sephiroth . Thats the introduction to VII as I will not go into it any deeper . I will say that the story gets more complex , very emotional and has some really good twists along the way . It also deals with more adult themes such as cussing and even some cross-dressing to name a few.Characters : Square dived in really deep on some characters background and left others barely scratched . Cloud and Sephiroth have the most character develpment in the game and their story 's intertwine quite a bit . As the game progresses though , Sephiroth and Cloud 's stories start developing on their own and not relying on each others . Aeris role and story in the game is probably the most important supporting characters in the game followed closely by Red XIII . Tifa , Barret and Cid get good stories into their backgrounds and definately add their importance in the story as well . Another member is Cait Sith who you find little about and forces his way into the party . Vincent and Yuffie are optional characters to have in your party and can easily be missed to get if you are n't paying attention , assuming you want them in the party in the first place . They do n't play much part in the story and have very little background insight on them during the game.Combat System : The combat system is developed around whats called materia . Its what you need to use magic and can be found after defeating bosses , lying around in room or just bought in stores . Everything that has to do with fighting is centered around materia , from equipping your weapons and items to casting magic-its a must to be knowledgeable about how to use your materia and use it properly . Your materia also gains experience in battles , not by using it though , but by equipping it to your armor and items you have equipped on your character . You can also use materia together such as the `` all '' and `` fire '' materia . You equip it on your weapon or item that has a sideways figure 8 looking thing on it and when you cast fire you hit all your enemies instead of one . The last thing about materia is once you max out your experience in say your `` fire '' materia it reproduces another one starting the new materia experince at 0 and you now have 2 fire materias instead of one-You can also do that to the summon materia 's too . A few other things about the combat is its an active time battle system which means while your choosing your commands for characters the enemy wo n't hang around and wait to attack . The last thing is your limit breaks which are special attacks that you get after your `` anger '' meter ( I guess that what you can call it ) fills up . You can set it to allies getting hit or if that particular character gets hit . There is a lot of materia out there so do n't be afraid to mix and match to see what goes with what.Graphics : The graphics in this game especially for its time , I thought to be simply unbelievable . The random battles are done in 3-D , a first that I know of , for an rpg to do that on a console system and definately set the bar for rpg 's to follow . The cg clips were simply breathtaking at the time but after today 's games its hard to believe I thought that when I first played the game . You can tell that they were definitely trying to move past the sprite based characters ( which they did in battles ) from the previous games but they just could n't leap that hurdle until Final Fantasy VIII . The backgrounds were interactive instead of just being completely preset , but were n't fully 3-D , I guess you could call it 2-D interactive.Music : Music is definitely one thing that can single handedly ruin an rpg such as repetitive fight music and travelling music . This is another area where VII excelled at . Sephiroth was given his own theme music ( one that most players if they heard would identify it in a split second ) and music at the gold saucer was definitely theme park music . Aeris ' theme was also very memorable and after a certain event in the game , upon hearing it you might be caught off guard and you could find yourself tearing up . Even orhestra 's have had concerts where you could find them playing music from VII and even other final fantasy titles.Minigames : This is one area where Square could 've done better . They have many minigames but few of the games are fun like the snowboarding and motorcycle chase . The others were rather boring and got old really quick . The chocobo races were fun but chocobo breeding was time consuming and ultimately a pain to do . The Gold chocobo was random in breeding and you could end up reseting you playstation for over an hour trying to get it . I persisted and got mine but the reward was almost not worth the hours slaving over it . Just remember if you do n't do it you never get to get the Knights of the Round materia , which is the most powerful summon in the game.Final Fantasy VII came from out of nowhere hitting the world like an asteroid sending shockwaves all over the video game nation . It single handedly put rpg 's on the map for the non-hardcore gamers and sent hardcore gamers into an rpg frenzy . Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but you ca n't deny that Final Fantasy VII deserved the hype that it created . It took all the best aspects of rpg 's such as the story , love story , character build-up , an easy to use and tactical fighting system and combined 3-D models for its random battles , an interactive background and music that has been remembered for over a decade . Also having follow up games years later coming out because of the huge fan base . You can say that another rpg would have done it sooner or later but the truth is Square put one heck of a game together and they did it first.You can call me a square fanboy if you want but the truth is I 'm an rpg lover . Yes , I have played almost all the final fantasy rpg 's out there . I have also played the incredible Lunar games , Grandia games , Xenogears , Xenosaga , Legend of Legaia , Legend of Dragoon and the list goes on and on to more recent titles on the ps2 and 360 . The truth is that none of those rpg 's shook the foundation of the entire gaming world and turned it completely upside down . Even people who hate rpg 's hate this game the most out of all the rpg 's out there because its the one they had to hear about the most ! Final Fantasy VII gets a straight 5 out of 5 and deserves more for the bars they broke and limits they pushed . Not only that , but its characters are timeless and memorable , its story is amazing and emotional and the music is like none other for its time .	1
I remember back in the old Playstation days where Final Fantasy 7 was all that you wanted play , which is not surprising since this very unique game has a very touching plot , graphics that are so very sharp , characters that you remember -- even 7 years back from the game ; it 's just a solid RPG game that should never be turned down -- -anybody will love this game . Continue on to hear details that I remember from FF7.The music was amazing . The music from many battles , where Cloud , the main character , faces enemies that are `` in his way '' , let 's put it , is very powerful and makes your heart race . Orchestrated , how would you say , music composed from a symphonic orchestra , just pure classical music -- THROUGHOUT the entire game ! It 's great ! One of the many strong points in this game.Cloud , the main character , starts off in a large , urbanized city , which you will see once you start the game , once you get off the train with that big muscular guy your with . This huge city you 're in is defiantly humungous , it really is ; skyscrapers , apartments , high rise buildings and smokestacks , it 's impressive I 'm telling you , and , you guessed , you 're going to have to explore the whole city in this adventure ! There will be instances where Cloud meets friends in different places as you progress through the game -- apartments , hospitals , high-rise towers.The story is very real with characters that respond like in real life . For example , I was playing a quarter of the way through the game , where we ( Cloud , other dude , a couple other of Cloud 's friends ) had to walk up many flights of stairs to the top of this monstrously tall building -- -Cloud 's friend gets tired of going up the whole stairway , `` how much longer do we have to go '' . That was when Cloud had to face another chaotic enemy , this time on the exterior elevator -- hey it 's challenging , but at least you get a good view of the city from a 1,000 feet up ! ... ..Another instance is where , in this large scientific industry , Cloud falls off a bridge ( not a bridge , just an overpass to walk on ) , 500 feet up in the air , with his girlfriend shouting for help -- -a very great movie sequence that I recall vividly.Obviously , I remember FF7 very well , because this game is like a movie that you , as Cloud , progress through , with obstacles , battles , conflict , even love scenes with Cloud and his girlfriend ( do n't worry -- that 's nothing compared to today 's standards ) . I tell you , without the enthralling and emotional , orchestrated music , this game would not be so great . But the FF7 has it ... music that is very suitable for the battleground , hideous situations , emotional moments , and many more instances.Overall , this game is spectacular and it will leave an impression on you . This game is that good , and I 'm telling you , you definitely need to get this game !	1
At a first glance , Final Fantasy VII appears to have boxy graphics , lack of special effects , and perhaps even a dull story-line with the stoic hero , Cloud Strife . However , this game offers so much more than what a quick glance can give . The characters ' graphics may not be fully detailed , but their personalities and body language make up for all of that . Each character was thoughtfully created with unique story , background , and demeanor . Unlike many of the Final Fantasy games , one does not get to know the villan as well as the mighty Sephiroth on Final Fantasy VII . I hated him , yet felt sorry for him at the same time . To make it an even more intriguing game along side of the story-line and character development , the battle system was well constructed . The Materia system allowed the player to equip Materia , ( magic ) to their weapons . ( Certain weapons had more Materia slots than others ) When some Materia is linked together such as -All- and -Lighting- it can create an overall attack on all the enemies versus just one . Though some may debate that the graphics sucked , one has to understand that this game came out in 1997 . Graphics six years ago were bound to be worse than what they are now.Pros : Characters that were deeply thought out and well woven into the plotA fun and addicting battle systemSeveral mini-games and great incentives for winningChocobo breeding and racingCons : Graphics may bother those that are use to newer gamesOverall , this game has so much to offer . I am always tempted to replay it because of things I missed , such as getting Cloud 's final limit break Omnislash or beating Ruby and Emerald Weapon . Just twenty minutes into the game , I was hooked . It was the first RPG I had ever played and ever since I loved the genre.Final Fantasy VII is worth all the Five Stars I give , because I believe it set the standard to the RPGs to follow .	1
If I do n't play this game for a period of time , I go through withdrawl and I 'm not kidding . This game features so many epic events and cinematic sequences . You start the game out wondering what it 's about , then you come attatched to it and you ca n't quit . Soon you are one with the game and you understand every little detail and you feel you are Cloud Strife , the main character . From the Assault On Reactor No . 1 to The Northern Cave to save the world from Sephiroth , this is beautifully thought out and planned . I believe there is not a better game out there . This is the game that made me an official RPG player . I did n't even know what an RPG was before this ! My first time playing this was on a japanese demo now out of print and very rare ... it came with the Tobal No . 1 double package . This demo had Final Fantasy 7 demo , Final Fantasy Tactics ( cinematic ) , and Bushido Blade ( cinematic ) . I heard about this game , and good things about it , so I decided to try it out . I played it , and it was very different from the regular game , for instance you start out with Aerith , Cloud , and Barret and magics ( Bolt , Bolt2 ; Ice , Ice2 ; Demi , Demi2 ; Fire , Fire2 , and Leviathan Summon ) . It was the Assault On Reactor No . 1 , then it ended . I soon became addicted and I played this demo every other day , and played it more than Tobal by far . I became very intrested in this game and everyday I played the Reactor level . I found more and more things , and I didnt have enough money to buy it , so I had to wait a whole year , and finally bought the 3 disc epic for playstation . Now I play it at least every two weeks , and I have beaten the game 3 times , and find a new secret and learn something new every time . This game is absolutely amazing . With a five-star rating , and not a four-star rating in sight , you know this HAS to be a good game , and it does n't lie . I love this game to death and it will soon be out of print , so pick your copy up today before it does .	1
First let me start off by saying that Final Fantasy VII was the beginning of the next generation of gamming , and I 'm not just talking about PS1 games , I 'm talking about all big games of the present day . FFVII is and was the blueprint for all the `` next generation '' games of today . Now that 's out of the way let 's talk about the game . FFVII is still the greatest RPG of all time , graphically the game shows it 's age ( circa 1997 ) , and the game play is n't exactly the easy moving/user friendly style we 're used to today , but those so called draw backs do n't hinder the awesome story , the great fantasy atmosphere , and the wonderful characters including Cloud , the quiet and reserved hero of the story and of course Sephiroth , who is in my opinion the greatest bad guy gamming has ever seen ( any fan of this game knows what I 'm talking about ) . I 'm not going to tell you about the story because I do n't want to ruin a great experience , just take my word for it , Final Fantasy VII is still my favorite video game of all time and if you give this masterpiece a chance you wont be disappointed . Five stars !	1
After playing all the US released predecessors to this title , I saw the commercials and got actually mixed feelings , feeling it would be hard core , but not as epic . Boy , was I WRONG ! The gameplay matches that of Final Fantasy VI ( FFIII in the US ) , but the controller for the playstation adds a new stability element to control . The battle system is very simple any [ person ] can win random battles with the clean interface . Also , the Materia System ( magic system ) is very user freindly and gives the character 's powers that you can almost feel you now posess yourself.To add to this interactive realism is the greatest graphics before Resident Evil 2 . The pre-rendered backgrounds are more artistic than most entire games are , the battles are cool with cool monsters and amazing spell effects , and the Cinematics , ... , well , just WOW ! To continue this interacive movie/addition to life itself is yet another great soundtrack composed by gamemusic god Nobuo Uematsu ( bigger than any other composer name ) . The music arranges from mysical to energetic , from simple to epic , and from peaceful to apacalyptic . & quot ; Aeris & quot ; , & quot ; Cid & quot ; , & quot ; The World & quot ; , & quot ; Jenova & quot ; and & quot ; The One Winged Angel & quot ; ( the last battle theme ) are the best tracks in the game , and some of the finest tracks ever devised.To complete this circle , Squaresoft gave this game a storyline of true epic preportions . While I did tear several times in earlier Final Fantasy titles , I never really CRIED , but when the big plot twist at the end of CD 1 occurs , I still ball my eyes out . Never before has emotion and narrative been combined so well into one epic . When done with the game ( and watching the stunning ending that 's beyond description ) , I felt like I just finished a novel , one in which was beyond the puny use of words could elaborate . I was in awe , and I think anyone who pays attention to this game would be too .	1
I was playing the other final fantasy games and I heard this one was like $ 1.000 of dollers but I find this and i am glad to casue i really wanted to play this . So yeah i am really happy with the item i got	1
okay , as you already know , this game has received a greatest hits NOT for graphics , but for GAMEPLAY and STORY . the complete idiots who gave this one star obviously know nothing about real games , and they probably spend their time playing final fantasy VIII , the single worst RPG ever conceived ( and 8 is my lucky number too ... .. ) .Final Fantasy VII is a phenominal story about an ex-mercenary soldier named Cloud Strife joining up with an underground resistance ( avalanche ) to help people in the city and stop the evildoers trying to destroy them . later on , after hours of non-stop fun gameplay and twists in the story , *SPOILER HERE*Aeris is stabbed in the back by sephiroth*SPOILER END*and that FMV scene is the first and so far the only video game to ever force me to shed a tear . i remember i was 9 when i got the game , and after reaching that part i cried , saved , shut it off , then went to hug my mother : ) as this DEFINATELY does not match up with final fantasy VI , it rivals with the second best RPG ever made : Final Fantasy II . considering that FFII had more challenge to it , but FFVII had a much better story , they both beat each other up pretty badly.all in all , i would shell out 15 dollars just to watch someone play it , the storyline is so good . the only game that can beat this one story wise is FFVI , but this is a really good game with very good gameply ( even though its a little too easy ) i recommend you buy this game , beat it , then get FFVI	1
I would first like to begin with a short complaint of those that dislike this game , but dont say why . All we ever here from those that 'hate ' the game is , & quot ; bad graphics , bad storyline , bad gameplay & quot ; . To be quite honest , one should not be writing a review on a game if one does not state reasons why the game is in fact , so good , or so bad . If you are trying to persuade someone to not like a game , then give the facts WHY something stinks , just dont say it does . Filling games with bad reveiws just gives a bad rap for no reason , for all of you who didnt in fact like this game , fill out a review with enough detail to describe what made the game so bad.Anyways , enough about bad reviews . This is the first game i played when i got my very first playstation so long ago when they were just coming out . I wasnt a gamer then , but this game turned me into one . Final Fantasy 7 must be the best game i have ever played . If you think about it , the games graphics were amazing considering the time it was introduced . I am still amazed today with the battle effects and cut scenes . Simply exceptional . The gameplay , well , to say in short , is wonderful . The game does an excellent job drawing the player into the storyline , and making the player FEEL like he or she is part of the game . I must have replayed this game over 30 times , each time finding new things . The FMV sequences are amazing , and can not be beaten . There are too many people that state the game has bad graphics ; the final fantasy series in itself has always had a cartoonish side to things , so i do not understand why anyone would say the graphics are bad . Sure we all have our playstation 2 's and saw how amazing Final Fantasy X looked , but keep in mind the time Final Fantasy 7 was brought out . Also , the music is amazing . When Aeris died , the situation and music almost made me cry . Then the battle afterwards , had you so mad , that you felt like pummeling Genova with everything you had . Which is what most did.Anyways , rather than subject this review with every little detail of the game , i will simply state , the game rocks , because it is so innovative , so drawing , and so damn good just plain and simple . A must have for any gamer.Final Fantasy 7 is still my favorite , even tho i am currently wrapped up in Final Fantasy 11 , but thats a different game.By this game and see yourself how wondrous it is .	1
Let me get this out of the way : I came late to Final Fantasy VII . I played Final Fantasy Adventure on the original Game Boy as a kid , and now that I 've grown up into a gamer I figured I 'd better go back and play some of the `` classics , '' and FF-VII was near the top of every list I could think of . So this review will be free of nostalgia , since I did n't ever play the game before two months ago.If you 're reading this I assume you know the basics ( this is an RPG , the first 3D Final Fantasy , et cetera ) . I 'm also going to take for granted that you realize that is game is over a decade old , and as such it 's a liitle unfair to compare it to today 's games ( though it has aged remarkably well ) .This is an original Playstation title , so it will play on your PS3 ( where it 's also available as a download from the PSN ) and your PS2 . You will only be able to save it on the PS2 if you have a PS1 memory card . I do n't own a PS3 , so I ca n't vouch for its saving capability.You 're tossed into the action from the moment you start the game ( this becomes a plot device later , actually ) . That made me wonder about if the game would be lacking in any kind of non-character-model cutscenes , but I was soon proven wrong : the cutscenes are beautiful , even by today 's standards.The combat system uses what 's called the Active Time Battle ( ATB ) system , a decent blend of turn-based and real-time . Each character has a time bar , and when it fills you input a command . Commands are executed one at a time , in the order they were chosen . Bars fill up during selection and sometimes during the execution ( depending on the action ) , giving an element of real-time . I had a gripe with this system as the game went on , as trying to locate one of the hundred or so items on my list was getting my characters hurt , but the feature can be turned off without penalty in the menu.The story is pleasingly deep , both in the main storyline as well as individual storylines for each character . The list of items and equipment is extensive . There is also an extremely high replay value for a single-player game , as the world is so vast , the items so plentiful , and the rewards for sidequesting high , including Yuffie and Vincent ( two party characters ) and a wealth of exclusive items , usually materia ( used to cast magic , add a buff , or add extra abilities ) or Limit items , which give characters a sort of ultra attack.Though few and minor , the game does have its flaws . Perhaps the most glaring is the lack of save points ( you only get one ) in the final level , which is pretty bad considering how devastating a lot of the enemies are . The game usually is portrayed as 3D character running around on what appears to be a 2D matte painting ; it looks beautiful , but occasionally is hard to figure out what 's a path or exit and what isn't.All told , though , the gripes are far outweighed by the quality of the game . Yes , this game is a classic for a reason . If you have ever played an RPG and liked it , give FF-VII a try . I did , and now I 'm a believer .	1
I got this game 11 years ago and could n't stand it . Only played it for about 20 minutes . I thought I was reading a book not playing a video game so I gave it away . 11 years later I played crisis core final fantasy 7 for the psp and thought `` wow this is a good story '' so I decided to play the original Final Fantasy 7 , to my surprise it was selling for well over 100 dollars , then I thought this must be a really good game . Come to find out this is a true masterpiece , after playing it I am hooked on Final Fantasy , they have such a wonderfully story , the graphics are always state of the art . And they are timeless treasures you can come back to even 11 years and say wow .	1
For all gamers out there , this is an excellent game to get ! It is a role playing game takes you around Cloud 's ( you ) world and you battle monsters and evil things . You meet many people and form a team of comrades to battle to the end . The graphics are quite exceptional and the magic is easier to handle than in Final Fantasy VIII . It kept me entertained for quite a while ! I have actually played it three times through because there is always new things to discover and do . But your gaming life in not complete without this awesome game . -- Jordan	1
Thanks of final fantasy product give a series of game that kid enjoy for hours in a different kind of word	1
Yes I said ONE of the best games ever made ... but not THE best . This game falls right behind ... XENOGEARS . You probably havent played it since its very hard to get . But it 's definently , in my opinnion the best game ever ... and if u have the chance then get it ! ! Anyways , FF7 has great graphics but the character models are totally ugly . The backrounds are very nice though , and so are the FMV'sThe gameplay is fun and addicting except ... THE BATTLE SYSTEM . Why is it that every Final Fantasy game has had a completely boring battle system . Why ca n't they make them like Xenogears ? ? ? Xenogears had a very very great and fun battle system . With battles like this in FF7 , you 'll always be wishing not to run into a enemy.The sound is perfectThe controls are easyThis game is great , period . And if you havent bought it yet then you are insane.Besides Xenogears , no game comes close to this	1
This game is EXCELLENT ! Even more so for beginners or people who 've never played a Final Fantasy game before ! The battle system is pretty easy and the equipment and command systems are n't hard to get either . The storyline is deep and memorable too , which is DEFINITELY a plus ! You definitely wo n't regret picking this game up !	1
Everyone complains how great or how bad this game was . To me when it first came out I loved it , it was the first Final Fantasy game I played i was like 9 or 10 years old . I still like the game a lot yes now it has bad graphics but they were cool back then . The story was good but at times made you laugh . Cloud was alright but there has been better but I thought sephiroth was a great bad guy and to me the best character in the game . Yes it is long but I enjoy games that take time to beat and it was n't very difficult to beat . I enjoyed that there was a lot of extra stuff to do in the game besides the main storyline which is smoething games are missing these days.All in all I still enojy playing this game as most of the other Final Fantasy 's , my favorite is 9 to be honest . They all have good and bad things about them . So it 's not my favorite game but its still one of them .	1
I spent pretty much a whole mounth of my life just playin this game and i dont regret it . This game is just so intence it pretty much starts to rub off on you a lil bit . THe story is very deep and even change a lil depending on how you play the game . Alas they 're are people who should never play this game ever . I like to call these people morons because all they can do while playing this is complain about the graphics . People need to look beyond graphics to see weather are not its worth playing .	1
Excellently plotted and paced , FF7 features several well-developed characters ( event the minor characters get some character development ) , a very well-developed villain , plenty of optional quests and things to do off the main quest , and a great score.The plot unfolds throughout the game , picking up its pace toward the end , but not falling prey to the common problem of tying up all the plot threads in two minutes . It 's well-paced , the plot twists arising out of the characters and situations as presented , and nothing really shows up as a deus ex machina ( except for the bit with the blasted snake ... ) The characters are generally well-developed ; while the three main characters get most of the development , each of the other characters , including the optional ones , get a few scenes with insight into their actions or their pasts . These characters also have reasons to be working together , rather than just thrown together haphazardly . The female characters are excellent , though Aeris is just a bit TOO perky.The villain is excellent , well-handled and well-developed . The lesser villains and some of the other NPCs also get a bit of character development ( the optional quest in Wutai with the Turks has to be one of my favorite bits in the game ) , And the villains ' actions make sense within the context.The materia system is complicated . Expect to spend some time fussing with it to understand how it works . This is not necessarily a negative , mind.The music is great . From what I understand , it 's a distinct departure from the earlier games , but I have n't played them . There are a few mediocre pieces , such as Honeybee Manor , but the truly excellent pieces , such as the Turks ' Theme , Nightmare 's Beginning ( Vincent 's Theme ) , and One-Winged Angel ( final battle music ) , more than make up for them , and there are no truly annoying God-don't-play-this-song-again pieces in it.The only real problem I have with this game , is that the FMVs ca n't be skipped ( there 's only so many times you can watch the thing with the gondola ... ) and that the last battle , especially if you 've done the optional quests , is too easy .	1
My favorite character is Sephiroth.He also makes an appearance in & quot ; kingdom Hearts & quot ; as the toughest boss in the game . ( but i beat him ! ) Final Fantasy VII is a brillant mind-blowing game.Cloud is the main character of this game.He also makes an appearance in & quot ; Kingdom Hearts & quot ; as 3 or 4 bosses , he 's easy.The thing is , I could n't even get past the mechanical scorpion ! The game is just way too hard for me.But I beat it.The Sephiroth 's are also Hard.If you 're in for some action , buy this.Cloud is just such an amzig character , and so is Sephiroth.sincerly , kenny	1
If you 've never played an RPG before , this one will spoil you rotten . This is where I really started , and I 've been trying to find stuff like this one ever since . If you 're new at this stuff , but would like to nestle inside of a safe non-threatening experience in the RPG realm , look no further . This is the Cadillac of RPG 's . It 's easy to play ; gives you ample opportunity for increasing your skills , and really touches base with many gaming experiences including fighting , racing , puzzle-solving , strategizing , etc .	1
I dont even know where to start . i played this game once when it when it just came out and once recenlty . the game is just breathe taking . Even with all the kick ass graphics out today , they are still no match for this game . I almost shedded a tear when a ceratin someone died . The rpgs in this game are decent compared to what is out there today . but remeber this game came out when psx just game out . At the beginning , you are a rebel named Cloud strife rebeling against Shinra corp. in a city called midgar . as you progress in the story you get invovled with clouds past , and he finds out revalations he never knew about himself . i palyed this game for 60 hours and i never got sick of it . if you have never played this game i suggest you GET IT ! ! ! its the best game i have ever played . this game had the most profits in Squaresoft history . Only a Playstation game could be this good . Nothin Xbox would ever have. [ ... ]	1
The game starts when you are Cloud a Shinra inc soldier and you quit and join a team of mercenaries called avalanche . They want to destroy all of shinra and make midgar a free town . You will fight in over 1000 battles with monsters and Hard bosses . You will have a long journey to finally reach your goal ... To KILL Seperoth for all people . He was a friend of yours until he went crazy and started killing . His artificial mother or not real mother Jenova is someone you must kill . She is deadly and youll find out how to kill her later in the game . Seprioth is the enemy , you wont find that out until later in the game . I dont want to spoil the game but.. its the best game ever made . !	1
I do n't know where to even begin my praises for FF7 because everything about it is exceptional . The graphics are probably the first thing one should notice . The characters look much like blocks of polygons , but the backgrounds are sweeping and beautiful and the FM7 's are seamless . The music is orchestral and extremely emotional -- Aeris 's theme is my favorite , but one ca n't forget One Winged Angel , which really heightened the feeling of the final battle.But my favorite part is the plot . In its complexity it is beautiful -- there is no possible way to understand it until one has played it more than once . It talks so much of self-sacrifice and giving oneself for a greater cause ; of self-doubt and self-searching ; of the greater knowledge and wisdom that the planet holds . The characters ' lives and pasts weave in and out of each other and each event sets off another deeper into the future .	1
This is my favorite video game . I still remember seeing the preview for it on TV : `` An evil empire is sucking the life force from the planet , destroying all that 's in its path . It 's up to one soldier of fortune to save the world . If he succeeds , you survive . If he fails , you can always hit the reset button . '' After the game came out , it was months before I could afford it . It was worth it . Over a decade later , no game has come close in meaning as much to me as this one.The story has a grown-up , realistic tone to it . Contrary to the old television preview , it is not an evil empire or kingdom that has taken over the world , but a corporation : Shinra Electric Power Company . The world is technologically advanced . The heroes sit at bars and ride trains and watch television . But it is also a world where magic is possible . Some of your characters use guns , some use sorcery or martial arts , and of course Cloud wields his famously massive sword , and because of terrific world-building , you can buy into the conceit with ease . ( Of course Cloud uses a sword in a world with guns and laser beams . He 's a super-soldier created in a complicated combination of magical infusion and injection with the cells of an alien being , so he 's strong and fast enough that a sword is more useful to him than a gun . ) The journey of the game 's heroes through the world is nothing short of epic . I still have fond memories of the places I traveled to in this game : the slums of Midgar , the Temple of the Ancients , Rocket Town , The Gold Saucer , even the Lost City of the Ancients ... This game almost made me cry . That 's how beloved its characters are . Sephiroth is the greatest villain of any game . ( One of my favorite moments in the game is when the heroes had to cross a swamp where a giant snake lived . When they tried to fight the thing , it defeated all of them with ease , so the heroes had to ride across the swamp on steeds so they could outrun it instead of fighting it . And on the other side of the swamp lies ... the cut up corpse of the same kind of giant snake . Sephiroth took it out single-handedly . ) Aeris is just a beautiful character , a pure-hearted girl raised in the slums but born with a special connection to the planet 's life force . And Cloud is the coolest of heroes . He 's noble , a little bit cocky , and kind of psychologically messed up with his repressed memories and all . And when you find out the truth about his past ... that just makes him cooler , in my opinion.There are moments in this game that will stay with you forever . They are iconic . If you 've played the game , you know what I mean . Seeing Sephiroth destroy Cloud 's hometown comes to mind . He 's standing in the fire unharmed and their eyes meet for a moment , then he turns and strides casually through the flames . And that spooky music is playing ( `` Those Chosen By The Planet '' ) with its bells tolling ... . Or when a main character dies ( the moment that nearly made me -- and a lot of other people -- cry at a video game ) , then that music plays . On that note , the music in this game is pitch perfect . The tense , rocking music for the boss battles , the creepy alien music when the heroes encounter Jenova ( or parts of her ) , the absolutely beautiful `` Aeris ' Theme . '' And the exultant , darkly emotional `` One Winged Angel , '' which plays during the game 's climax is awesome.So there you have it . Video games ' greatest hero and villain all in one place . The coolest world combining science , sorcery , robot cats , and even a rocket ship . Music that will haunt you . An epic story about life , and humanity 's place in it . Characters that feel more like friends . I keep waiting for a game to come along that will match this one , and I 've played many games since . If you have never played this before then do n't let the outdated graphics scare you away ( I remember how impressed I was with them at the time ) . Even now , it 's still worth it .	1
FF7 was my first game to play from FF . Great graphics , very mundane story , and the mini games were very well worth it . This game should be added towards your FF collection .	1
This is my favorite old game . This game can take well beyond 100 hours of game play . Many side quest like raising Choco Bos for racing . The best part for kids is that they have to read all the dialog . Lots of good cinema 's .	1
A classic for anybody who still has a Playstation , or a Playstation 2 . This game is pretty freakin ' awesome . Not going to spoil anything , but you should play it if you have n't already .	1
this is possibly the best game i have ever played , besides the upcoming MGS2 , if you are a gamefan and dont haveb this game you outa be ishamed of your self . go buy it lowly maggot !	1
Final Fantasy VII was the first release for the Playstation , and the advance in graphics and gameplay brought new popularity to this great series.You play as Cloud , a member of a team of environmental bandits . This rebel group is trying to stop Shinra , an evil corporation , from stealing all of the planet 's energy , `` Mako '' .The leap in graphics between Final Fantasy VI and this one is pretty amazing . Where FF6 was a 2D game with 16 bit graphics , this one was fully rendered 3D graphics . You move your polygonal character through a richly painted `` mural '' of a world . The sound quality is also much better.Along the way , Cloud is joined by Barret , who looks and talks like Mr. T from the A Team . Tifa Lockheart and Aeris Gainsborough also join him - both are characters that are found on the FF/Disney blend Kingdom Hearts.Of course there is a Wedge and Biggs , named after the Star Wars characters . In fact , one of Biggs ' early lines is almost straight from the movie . There 's a Cid too - he 's an airship pilot . This is the Cid they used in Kingdom Hearts.Finally you reach and meet Sepiroth , and his many forms . The game is very rewarding to play , even though its graphics have been surpassed by later versions of Final Fantasy .	1
The highest grossing Final Fantasy game , and still beating out other Final Fantasy sales on the PSN . One who can not understand the complexity , maturity , imagination , and heart that went into its story would be the kind to give it a rating of one or even be foolish enough to compare it to Final Fantasy VI.Okay , enough of the overly smug and satirical comments . It is entirely subjective what people think of any Final Fantasy game , but what is objective is that it is the best selling Final Fantasy game to date refer to the following website for further proof if you need a reference : [ ... ] The sales of this game will continue to rise with Steam support , and it is well worth its place in the number one spot . I have tried other Final Fantasy games because of VII and not found them as impressive based on their RPG elements of leveling up materia , upgrading weapons , and limit breaks.Comparing VII to IX you will be frustrated that if your character goes into trance mode ( which is the limit break of VII ) just before a different character kills the last remaining enemy , then that is a trance gone wasted . In Final Fantasy VII you can hold on to that limit break until you face the next boss . I understand that VIII does the same , but I can not stand it 's gil earnings system , card mechanics , or even characters . Cloud is a complex and confused character , but he 's not a total d*ck like Squall . Aeris is a character you care for immediately , Red XII 's personal story involving his father will bring tears to your eyes , Cid 's rekindling his view of Shera changes him as a person , even Yuffie 's story with her hometown and father is relatable despite the little punk stealing your materia . The way I review games is based on their performance as a game , such as what you find annoying about certain games and how the usual mechanics fair for this one . Without further ado , allow me to break it down objectively.Camera : Many games these days suffer camera issues that are downright unbearable , but Final Fantasy VII 's camera is always placed in the right overhead area and for some levels at in a nice side scrolling style . You can customize how you want the camera to behave during battle sequences , and you can even control the camera while on the world map . The camera here is perfect with no complaints.Graphics : The graphics are not even that of the typical Playstation format , but not in a bad way . It still hangs on to its roots during story sequences , but during the battles they change entirely to appear more anime inspired , and the cutscenes may seem dated are still decent even for today . Its late old school gaming at its best which helps you harken back to when what mattered most was the ... Gameplay : Addicting to say the least . Having trouble putting down the controller until you can leave Midgar ? No one is judging you here . The game mechanics are flawless in what they provide in terms of gameplay . Sure , you could always add more , but why fix what is n't broken in this masterpiece ? Grinding might seem a little annoying , but it 's not about leveling your character up to be twice as strong as the end level boss . The battles are all about strategy , which is understandable why many do n't comprehend that . You level up your character , level up materia , swap items , prepare accessories and weapons , earn proper amounts of gil from battles , sell mastered materia , find stronger weapons and armor , mingle with townsfolk , decide how you want to treat an ally , breed and race Chocobos , go on mini side quests , partake in a few hilarious main quests , and all of it feels rewarding . The replayability is on high for this because you can always go back and make different choices in another playthrough , or just relive the story and imagination . One disc was n't enough to pack such massive gameplay as it required a full three for the mighty Playstation hardware . Do n't think you have beaten the game if you have n't beaten Emerald or Ruby WEAPON either . It does n't end with just Sephiroth.Story : This may be the first game where I add story into the review as the story is its own character in the game . Every character has an emotional background , even the optional characters of Vincent and Yuffie . What happens to Aeris is not groundbreaking even for a Final Fantasy game , but her lacking presence is felt as you journey deeper into the Promised Land hoping to thwart Sephiroth at the reunion for what he has done . Yuffie 's teen angst is terribly relatable despite her annoying dialogue , and even Red XIII 's mistaken view of his father is met with goosebumps . Even the hard shelled Barret has his past come back to haunt him that must be faced . It 's stories that are all wrapped up into one incredible story as you journey to save the planet from being destroyed at the hands of a god in the making . Step aside , Kefka , Sephiroth is no laughing matter.Controls : The controls are completely flawless and perfectly responsive . Any game with perfect controls are completely playable based off that reason alone , but Final Fantasy VII utilized your controls in different ways many times so you gain the most from your experience . You snowboard , defend your allies by motorcycle , ride and race chocobos , fly the greatest airship in the Final Fantasy series , and battle intimidating monsters . Still the controls are a small part of what consists of this legendary game.Sound : The regular sound effects again take you back to the old school Final Fantasy days , but the music is without incomparable . From when the game first kicks off in Midgar , to when you first meet Aeris , to the excitement of the Gold Saucer , to the dramatic confrontation Red XIII has with what is left of his father , to the final confrontation with Sephiroth . Every tune strikes a chord that will last forever and is ingeniously constructed as well as perfectly fitting . No Final Fantasy game sounds as pleasant , and that is n't based off of just nostalgia . The music is perfect for listening to outside the game with melodies that will bring you back to your first experiences.In conclusion , words do not do this game justice . Play for yourself especially if you need to catch up on classic Final Fantasy games ( now that they 're going the annoying subscription fee route ) . Enjoy what brought this series to its success and make Sephiroth pay .	1
I love the story in this game , the battle system , music , just everything about this game is good ( yes the graphics are are bad but i dont care because its the first 3-d one they did and second its an old game ) so i would just like to say by this game you will spend hours playing it .	1
I 'm old enough to remember when RPGs were n't called RPGs . In those days the essence of the game was to move the players about a game board , fighting battles , collecting treasure , and finding clues . Origin 's Ultima series was the grandparent of these games - immensely entertaining , but essentially two-dimensional . Among its heirs were the first games in the Final Fantasy line.This was also a time when computer capabilities and capacity seemed to double every few months . Final Fantasy VII is the result of an inevitable synergy between technology and imagination . Players found themselves in a three-dimensional world where they could wander at will . They were playing with characters that were not only more animated and lifelike , but also had something that resembled personalities . In a very real sense , FFVII changed the gaming landscape , and RPGs reached a new level of credibility.What is inside is the story of Cloud Strife ; an ex-soldier turned mercenary who is drawn into the struggle between Avalanche , a revolutionary group , and Shinra , a rapacious company that is rapidly draining the resources of the planet . Starting out in the city Midgar the battle moves back and forth across the planet , as Cloud gathers team members , accessories and power . Everyone has a history , often mysterious , and an important role to play.Eventually it becomes clear that the real enemy is a laboratory experiment gone horribly wrong . Shinra 's effort to produce supermen has created Sephiroth , who has become one of the legendary villains of the gaming world . Physically beautiful , his mind has been ruined by his knowledge of what he is , and his goal has become the destruction of the world.The plot is remarkably rich . Within the main story arc are many smaller stories that build the players understanding of the nature of each of the characters . There seem to be an unending number of weapons , powers , and monsters . More than enough material for many replays . The graphics are a bit primitive for our time , but were startling when this game first came out . As your imagination adapts to the imagery , the game becomes truly engaging on many levels . Final Fantasy VII is still one of the best of its genre , Whether you are a student of gaming or an aficionado , it belongs on your shelf .	1
This was a very addictive game , with lots of fun involved . When I first saw this game , I thought it would reek , because the fighting scenes are n't great . But this game is a lot more than just fighting , it 's an awesome RPG , maybe one of the best . Some of the bad language is not needed , but it 's easy to look past that.One thing that really bugged me was that in some parts it was just too hard , and you could walk around for hours and not figure out what you were supposed to do . But other than that it was great . You can actually play arcade games inside this game , and there is even a place where you can shoot some hoops ! There is a big mix inside this , you can drive a motorcycle , a chocobo : } , and some hover crafts . This game is really fun , and has I think about 50 hours of gameplay on three different discs , so go out and get yours today ! Jesse	1
fun to play , good music , great story , all around fantastic game , its would be nice to see it in high def on the ps3 though ( remake ) .	1
title says it all . the final fantasy games that followed this one just were n't anywhere near as good . everything about this game is pure gold .	1
Although the graphics arent as good as one would expect , the characters are very well done . Espeically Sephiroth , he seems to be the very essence of evil with the tricks he pulls of in the game . Many of the mini games are great my only beef with the mini games is that they should of amde the mini-battle game available in the Golden Saucer , also why didnt they put in real voices in the end instead of a postscript ? This was probably to save money so Square wouldnt have to hire voice actors . Although the plot veers off track at times and a few of the program quirks are noticable this games still enjoyable and has a well written story .	1
I wouldnt advise anyone to pay hundreds of dollars for this game when you can get it at gamestop for only 29.99.Do n't be fooled .	1
This is official now as PSOne classicscheck out your playstation account and get one	1
Recently threw this into the PS2 and revisited what I consider to be not only the best RPG but the best game of all times ... Aeris . All I got ta say . : D	1
Booooo yeah ! Best game I 've played ! If you like action adventure , this is the best game for it . It is sooooo cool , the movies are pretty cool also , weapon , a monster , IT LOOKS AWSOME ! ! ! ! ! ! ! This game is totally the best , best graphics , it is just too cool . No blood so parents , no fear for children , just violence . I recomend this game to EVERYONE ! No need to rent , buy it while you still can ! I ca n't for one , to good of a game I guess .	1
Yup another game for the kids they really liked this one too . This is played quite a bit and still working	1
I have been a fan of The Final Fantasy Series since it first came to the US for the NES . This is yet another great game in the series . It has great graphics for its time . It has a very involving story with a lot of plot turns and it has a lot of likable characters that you actually would like to learn more about as the story unfolds . I would recommend this game for anyone that is into sci-fi , fantasy and RPGs .	1
Final Fantasy VII in my opinion is the best RPG game ever created and it definately blows away the others that have followed . The graphics are not as good as the ones that followed but one has to think of when this game came out . The story was supurb , music was great and there 's not too many villians like Sephiroth . It took me many , many hours to beat this and many days at work struggling to stay awake from staying up all night playing . Not too many games have kept my interest like this one did , my life would n't have been complete if I did n't beat this game . Most that like this type of games know what I 'm talking about but to those who have n't played this should check it out . This is definately the break through game that changed RPG games forever .	1
When i first played this game , I was stunned . This game is the basis for any RPG ever put into circulation . There is no way you can not be moved by the storyplot . The characters in this game have a one of the gratest Personality that any RPG game can offer . The score ( soundtack ) of this game is one of the bests ever put into an RPG because it sets the tone for this.In order to play this game , You need to have a mind that can understand the reality of the game and I Mean that in a good way . Even if you 're not into RPG 's , Any true playstation Gamer should own a copy because it is a Miracle . This game is one for the books .	1
Final Fantasy VII - Circa 1997GOOD : - Considered a Classic PS1 RPG by many people- Arguably Best story in a video game- Epic story with fleshed out characterBAD : - Graphics are really dated , 3D character models looked old even in 1997- Game play may feel datedIF IT FITS YOUR TASTE : - Turn based RPG- No voice-overs , so there is lots of reading- Unless your looking for or like that retro look/feel of an RPG , it will feel dated to those raised on Final Fantasy X or Kingdom HeartsGAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO : - Final Fantasy VIII- Final Fantasy IX- Legend of Dragoon- Chrono CrossADDITIONAL NOTES : - There is two versions of this game in one version the female playable character is called Aeris and in another it is called Aerith ( note this is the same character ) - There is a version for the P.C . as well- The CG movie Final Fantasy : Advent Children is a direct sequel to this game- Note : all Final Fantasy are not related to one another , think of each Final Fantasy a it 's own game not connect in any real/true way to another Final Fantasy , the only exception is Final Fantasy X-2 which is a sequel to Final Fantasy X	1

The graphics are dated and the story 's mediocre . The game is still good . Let 's face it , people . There will never be a perfect RPG , but this one is good . You 've all heard the story , yet here 's what 's great about it . Really good side quests , beliveable charecters , and beatiful movies . What 's bad is the plot , the graphics , and the last boss . That 's it . Goodbye .	1
I bought this game back when ps1 was the new system . I had never played an RPG before and FF7 was recommended to me by a friend . First night playing I out in 5 hours , I was floored , to say the least . Everything about the game was great , the battle system , story , length , difficulty , I love the materia system and overall I have not one bad thing to say about this amazing game . There is nothing else like it ( I 've looked ) . No other final fantasy even comes close , and I 've played and beat every single one . In my opinion , to date , this is the single greatest game ever made and a must have for any RPG fan . I REALLY CA N'T BELIEVE the people who gave this game 1 star . Such people are fools and not true gamers in any way . Buy the game , you wo n't regret it !	1
Its been a decade since this game has been released & all i can say is 'wow ' . This game gets soo much praise ( and well blasphemy too ) & even has been hailed as 'Quite Possibly The Greatest Game Ever Made ' , however that 's not possible , only to those who think this is the greatest game ever made . But i urge people to try this game out , despite the outdated graphics & no voice overs.You start off as a mercenary , an Ex-Soldier named Cloud who is working with a group named 'Avalanche ' , a team of members who infiltrates Shin-Ra 's biggest Mako city , Midgar . Mako is destroying the planet & Avalanche ( known as hippies or treehuggers ) is trying to stop that from happening . What Cloud does n't realize is he 's closer to Shin-Ra then he thinks . And a mysterious man known as Sephiroth suddenly attacks Midgar after a tragic event that took place in..Crisis Core : Final Fantasy VIICloud must search for this man as he deals with Shin-Ra & the Turks . All while he tries not to lose his sanity.Ok in my opinion the best way to un-cover this story is to play the first half of Crisis Core ( until you reach Nibelheim ) then start playing FFVII ( this game ) until after you get past the part where you find out about Zack . Then go back to Crisis Core , beat that then finish FFVII . It does n't really matter what game you play first & vise versa but if you play this game all the way through it pretty much spoils the ending for Crisis Core . Although i still think it was exciting to see the ending in higher graphic quality i just knew what was going to happen.Anyways on with the review..Story 10/10 : The story for this game is superb , although it lacks a few minor details that not even Crisis Core reveals it still has one of my favorite story-lines in the entire history of videogames or movies . I do recommend you play this game before Crisis Core ( before Nibelheim ) just because Crisis Core reveals what really happens to Cloud & then this game wo n't really keep you interested . Besides that though i really think this game is still considered one of the best ! Graphics 6/10 : The graphics for this game was superb when it first came out . No one still really cared too much about them yet & Square really showed them off for this game ( this game was originally in production for the N64 ) except for the fact that you have blocks as hands ! I believe the main game for the N64 was n't completely scrapped as they were trying to make this for that system but then realized the potential of having CG clips for the PlayStation they went with that system instead . So for those wondering why the graphics look so cartoony in this one , im pretty sure thats your answer . The CG movies still look amazing for the ps1 , granted that Square got better at it with FFVIII . Either way , Square is trying to get the original team from this game to pull off a grand remake ( to make this game look REALLY NICE ) which is still in question , however they have other games they 're working on nowGameplay 7/10 : Well , lets just say that its not hard but its not easy , of course the actual battles are fairly simple if you know what your doing . And leveling up your characters & materia are the only main factors you have to worry about in progressing in the game . The problem with moving your character around is that your fumbling around with the directional sometimes because its not quite calibrated right . Or its just the camera view , however its annoying at times.Music/Sound ( 10/10 ) : I enjoyed the music from this game , i still think it 's one of the best ones Square did . Everything from the Bombing mission to Cid 's theme this game has it done perfectly ! Another good reason why Square wanted this game on the PlayStation , crystal clear stereo sound ! Concept 6/10 : While it took me several times to go through the game ( and beat it ) which for some people who do n't understand the story will have to play it through a few times . The thing that people get most confused on is the materia setup . While it was easy for me to grasp some people were like 'huh ! ? ! ? ' It 's like trying to teach a cat how to drive . I thought this concept was easier then some of the FF games that came out after this one . But yet again , easy for some , hard for others.Replay Value 10/10 : Personally i think this game should have had a new game+ function ( where you can go through the game again with stats , materia , items ect . But maybe if Square gets a remake going they 'll throw that function in . Only because i never get tired of this game & its one game that does deserve a remake.Overall , i did give this a full 5 star rating only because i still think this game is the best , despite its problems . And for those who have n't yet check out Crisis Core as well , great prequel to this game .	1
this is the 2nd bess Final Fantasy in the entire series . Only Final Fantasy 3 ( US ) beats this . the story is absolutely the best in the series next to FF3 . it is sad and exciting . this is definately a hall-of-famer in the game world : )	1
Final Fantasy 7 brought a brand new battle system by using materia . It made all gamers want to play it over and over again . While some battles can be tough the game is magificent . The additon of the tough American Monsters gives even the best RPG gamer a hard time . If there was one thing I would have asked for about the game I would have wanted to be able to play has Sephiroth . Just looking at him its a wonder you could beat him . ( Unless you have Knights of the Round ) The game is good and I would reccomend it to every RPG gamer out there .	1
I having been playing Role Playing games steadily since nintendo , and Sega Master System . And this is the Best Role Playing game I have played with Phantasy Star of Master system a close 2nd . I am only on disc one still , but I ca n't stop playing this game I have to finish it , I just bought FFIX , after reading a review on FFVIII I decided to pass but may go back if someone can change my mind .	1
Final Fantasy 7 is one of the greatest playstation games . It is better than Final Fantasy 8 because of its story . Final Fantasy is a great time if you are looking for something that will keep you happy till you get a playstation 2 . This game is one of the best .	1

This game is truly the best game i ever played on the playstation game console . the character design : perfect the map : perfect the story : perfect this is the greatest games ever made by square soft are this game and close behind is chrono trigger which you can get in a joint package with final fantasy 4 , another very well made square soft game and very much worth buying ... later ... ... .	1
Is Final Fantasy 7 really the best one out of them all . To me Yes ... To the fans ... YES ... . According to Square-Enix ... . Double YES . This is the companies most cherished and prized game . So much so that they are too afraid to disturb it in any way and have said so openly . But a remake is not lost , remember the 2006 PS3 Tech Demo ? Gamers we have a voice , if we want this to happen we need to be heard any way possible . Look at how fast Microsoft removed their xBox One digital downloads only scheme when we united . Keep at telling Square-Enix to remake this game any way possible . The day will come . Then we 'll just need to bug Sony about Legend Of Dragoon next.Anywho , one of my favorite games . Unless Final Fantasy 15 ends up being better ... ... ... ... ... It 's a long shot though . Graphics can only take a game so far .	1
I remember all the hype surrounding Final Fantasy VII when it was set to be released . GamePro had allready said it may be the greatest game ever made , and that itself is quite a title . I never really liked RPG 's , I 'm more of an action gamer , but with all the hype surrounding this game , I figured what the [ heck ] and rented it a few days after it came out . I was dumbfounded the first time I played it , I was speachless . At the time I had never seen graphics like that , and the storyline was so engrossing that I felt a wave of depression actually set over me when I had to take it back . As pathetic as that sounds , the day I returned it to the video store , I went out and bought Final Fantasy VII and kept playing for days . Eventually I beat it , then a buddy of mine showed me his strategy guide and I realized I missed a lot of side stuff and extras , so I played through again using the guide , and the experience was even better . If you have never played any Final Fantasy game before this one is worth picking up , even if you do n't like RPG 's you 'll dig this , though I suggest picking up the BradyGames strategy guide to make the game even sweeter . Truly one of the greatest games ever made .	1
The abdominal escapade RPG game Final Fantasy VII . Quite possibly the most excellent Final Fantasy ever in a lot of people 's minds . I will agree that this game is extremely great and Square deserves every bit of credit . It has its ups and downs just like every other game out there . I really do like everything about this game but I do like the other Final Fantasy 's out there . So if you have only played this game I suggest you try the other Final Fantasy 's that have been released.If the intro made you mad then I 'm sure that the rest of the review will make you happy . Starting out as a former member of `` Soldier '' you take the main role of Cloud . You start out with a rebellion group by the name of AVALANCHE and do n't forget it . Your inaugural mission is to blow up the reactor to get the attention of `` Shinra Inc. '' to let them know they are ruining the planet by having these mako reactors . So make your point , grab your huge sword and let the adventure begin.Story 10Every body who has played this game knows that the story line is what makes FFVII live up to its title . You are an ex SOLDIER member and joined a group called AVALANCE to stop Shinra ( the bad guys ) from using all the energy from the planet . WHY ? ! Because stealing stuff from the planet is not good , that 's why . On your way from destroying a mako reactor ( steals energy ) , you run into a pretty flower girl . That whose name I will not say , it 's a secret . One of your beginning characters is Barret who is the leader of Avalanche , and with him is Tifa who runs the bar they all hide at , and she also watches his daughter Marlene . Cloud use to live with Tifa in their town called Nibelheim , surprised to see Cloud she runs up to him and asks him how he has been over the past 5 years since they have seen each other.Starting out kind of fast you will notice the game makes a more pace able progress in the story line . The story is n't as long as `` Xenogears '' , but at least you will understand what is going on if you might happen to miss something earlier . Even on my 10th or so time going through the game I still just go through for the story and the game play , but for the most part the story . You have a main villain of course and he goes by the name of Sephiroth . You will meet all kinds of exciting characters and go to new towns that are perfectly designed . Like any other story there are sad times and the good times , but we all want to remember the good times . As we all know the story is one of the best and it keeps you coming back for more . If they just made this game a book , it would definitely be on the top 10 list in no time . That is how good the story is , it 's hard to put into words how much you should like it . So just enjoy and move on with the game.Game Play 10The battling system is as normal as any other Final Fantasy . You attack the enemy they attack you , heal , and use magic , all of those good things . At least they do n't have the same boss music over and over . Some of the bosses even have dialog in your battles , nothing too major just a grunt or two about how they do n't like you and they think that they are going to win the battle . The magic is the basic elements plus your non elementals . There are summons to use which have extraordinary graphics , and a lot of them are just cool looking . The bosses have certain types of skills that you can use by getting a certain `` Materia '' called enemy skill , all you have to do is wait for them to use the move and your character absorbs the move into there little Materia for later use . The Materia is what contains your magic and special techniques . It can have magic all the way to your little friends called the summons . Each of the first couple of summons they are elemental too , such as Ifrit , he is a fire based monster . Along with Shiva whom is an Ice based monster . They all have their own special `` move '' that will help you in each of your battles.There is also a little feature called Limit Breaks . So if you ever get tired of using summoning 's or using magic use one of these . When that little red bar fills up you use that limit skill and blow those enemies away . Each character has 4 levels limit breaks except for one of them . And when you do a certain amount of using one limit you can get the next extravagant limit . With the first 3 levels of limit breaks there are two in each one . But the forth level of limits is the ultimate which you might have to work you 're butt off to get that special item . So there is a lot to keep up with in the game play , make sure you do n't forget to check for items hidden in secret places , when it comes to fighting every item you find will help.Graphics 9Being the best graphics of this time of gaming , FFVII tops it all . To start off the characters have no mouths which is ok at least its better than having no faces at all like `` The Grand Stream Saga '' . But we will continue on with this game . The magic has ok graphics at the beginning but as you get stronger magic the graphics glint every where all over the screen . Each element of magic ( Fire , Thunder , Earth , Ice are the major ones ) has 3 levels , and each graphic is bigger each time and can grow even larger when you 're fighting multiple enemies and use it on all of them . The summoning 's probably are the better detailed of graphics when it comes to battles . There are sixteen bundles of joy waiting for you in the wonderful world out there . Each one you summon has there own special element or non-element attack when you summon them.The graphics can be very beautiful the first hundred times that you summon them but after a while they can get exasperating of seeing them do the same thing over and over again . Now on to the videos , each video is really greatly detailed . The characters and the surroundings are spectacular , they have mouths in the videos , they actually move to the words but you do n't hear them unfortunately . You can tell they tried not to get too detailed with the characters so they would n't look nothing like they do in the game , but they basically paint the picture for what they would look like if the game had better graphics . The Limit breaks as I mentioned earlier have really sole graphics for each one of them . The limits seem to actually fit the characters look , such as cloud he will use his sword and completely ruin everything around him . Barret will use his `` handgun '' , to blow away the enemies with ammunition . Each character has graphics to go with them and fit their attitude , and Square really did a good job emphasizing on their details . With ever bit of effort they put into the graphics they really deserve all of the love from everyone.Sound 10One of Nobuo Uematsu 's best works in music ever . This is definitely a buy worthy soundtrack . If you do not own the game or the soundtrack , I suggest you save up some money and get both of them right after you get through reading my review . Each song fits with the surroundings perfectly , the best part is when you listen to the song by itself then it will remind you of when you were in that specific area or a certain video in the game . I believe if music can do that than it is how the title `` music '' is deserved . While talking about the music the sounds that characters and monsters make are special in their own way too . Unfortunately as I mentioned earlier the characters talk in videos but there is no sound . So pft to them ! But I am sure that you can tell from the dialog when the character may be excited or very angry.The magic and summons have sounds to them also . When you have a larger leveled magic the sound lasts longer . Because the bigger the magic the longer it takes to finish its use . Each of the summons makes a noise when they perform their duties . Such as when Ifrit sets out his meteor fire ball I am sure you can imagine the big explosion noise that gargantuan rock lets out . When you use items they make noises too , nothing special though just a nice little ring to let you know that you have used it I guess . When you fill up your limit break bar it makes a noise to let you know you 're ready to use it , but if the sound does n't let you know I 'm sure the bright flash of fire around your character should get your attention . Every little noise you should notice and remember the rest of your measly life . If you do n't then I guess you 're not as big of a loser you thought you were now huh . So to Nobuo I thank you for giving us this wonderful piece of art you call the FFVII soundtrack . I am sure that everyone would agree with me.Story 10Game play 10Graphics 9Sound 10Overall rating 10 ! ! ! ! ! ! If you have n't figured it out by now , you need to go out and play this game . Do what you have to , and make sure you go through the whole thing and enjoy yourself . A lot of people will tell you this game is over rated . Even if it is so what , it 's a good game and that is all that matters . While mentioning this great FF title I suggest that you try some of the older titles that are great too , such as FFIII or FF the original . This is one of the best series of games out there and if you have n't heard of it yet then you need to have a better source of information for games . So go out and play this you will love it ! I bet when you find a penny on the ground you will be thankful it helped you buy this game .	1
Man if you want to experience the greatest video game ever then this is it , look no farther . This game has it all.1 . The most well thought out story ever on a video game.2 . Great character development.3 . Many many side quest.4 . Dymatic ending and great finish.If you can find any game that can match that criteria and do it as well as FF7 , then I 'll eat your hat ! ! ! Screw 5 stars ... .100 stars ! ! !	1
With impressive graphics , unforgettable characters , and a simply amazing storyline , Final Fantasy VII is definately a game that should n't be underestimated . There are many ways to go about playing the game , you can go straight through the story , or you can take your time and explore . And that 's one of the things I like about RPGs . It 's a must have for any gamer , in my opinion .	1
Back when this game came out , I received a video tape of the game in the mail , I watched it several times , that was the day I decided that the Playstation was a good system , I ended up buying the game first , then getting the system for my birthday 2 weeks later . This game is the best Playstation game ever made , not to mention the best RPG . I have played through it twice , the first time by myself , and the second time with the Official guide book , it was amazing both time through , I spen 76 hours the first time , and 90 hours the second . The second time took longer because I got my characters levels up really high like 99 .	1
Even though the Final Fantasy series was already incredibly popular in Japan , before this game was released in the United States RPGs were not quite as well known as other kinds of games . Final Fantasy 7 , the first Final Fantasy on the Playstation and to use 3D graphics , changed everything about the console RPG genre . Even though people will have differing opinions about the enjoyability of this game , no serious gamer would deny the tremendous influence Final Fantasy 7 has had on videogaming.By today 's standards , the graphics in this game are quite primitive , but at the time they were absolutely amazing . The 2D backgrounds are still great to look at today , as well . The music in this game is also great , despite the rather limited selection of sounds Nobou Uematsu had at his disposal . Of particular note is the song that plays during the final boss encounter , `` One Winged Angel '' , which is still beloved by Final Fantasy fans today.Despite the move from 2D to 3D , the gameplay in Final Fantasy 7 is similar to the previous six Final Fantasy games . As you control your character on an overworld map , you encounter random mobs which you fight in an `` active time battle '' system . The magic system , based on `` materia '' , is new and just complicated enough to provide some strategic depth without overwhelming new players . Playing through the main story is not particularly challenging ( some bosses may require a few tries ) , but there are extensive side quests available at the end of the game , some of which are very involved and difficult without a solid strategy.However , the main attraction of this game is the story . Anyone who has played through the game will remember Cloud , his friends , and the enigmatic Sephiroth , who are still iconic figures in the game world . ( That Square-Enix still releases games and movies based on the FF7 world helps , no doubt . ) The plot is quite strange and frequently confusing , but in its essentials it worked for me . The translation could have used some more polish , but is of good enough quality as to not distract from the rest of the game.If there are people studying the history of video games fifty years from now , there is little doubt that Final Fantasy 7 would be one of the games they would look at , since it is probably the most influential console RPG ever . If you have n't played this game yet and have any interest in RPGs , at all , you should try to find a copy of this game and play it . If only Square-Enix would re-make this game for the PS3 !	1
This game is a beautiful work of art that takes you on a trip through happiness , sadness , anger , and just about every other emotion conceivable by man . This game will attach itself to your brain and never let you forget about it . This game never ceases to evoke a reaction from the player , and never ceases to amaze everyone who plays it.STORYLINE : One of the most intricate that I have ever played . The storyline rivals that of Albert Odyssey , which I regarded as being the greatest RPG before I played this . What initially begins as a fight to destroy an evil corporation becomes an entire journey towards revenge and the defending of things greater than the world . 10/10MUSIC : The music is beautiful , always fitting , and stays in your head for days . Aeris ' Theme alone is enough to motivate you to buy the soundtrack . Absolutely wonderful . Almost the best aspect of the game . 11/10CHARACTERS : The best . Cloud looks so cool with his gigantic sword , and the ability to rename them just adds on to the fun . As one man already said , `` This is probably the first game that I 've played in which a main character dies without a huge rescue or love scene right before it . '' Even though they 're just game characters , they feel real . 10.25/10OVERALL : Final Fantasy VII is the best RPG , if not the best game , ever created by man . YOU MUST BUY THIS GAME . Period . 10/10	1
I 've played Final Fantasy 7 , 8 , and 9 and I have to say 7 is the best . Every part of this game is perfect . Sure , the characters are n't highly detailed but for the time when this game was made they 're perfect . You find yourself falling in love with these super deformed people . Especially Cloud who is the best main character in all of the Final Fantasy games . The story line is very involving . People would n't play this game for 60-80 hours if the story was n't good . It 's almost disappointing that they did n't base the Final Fantasy movie on this game but ... if they did that you 'd already know the ending . This game is a masterpiece . I would n't change one thing about this game . I love it !	1
I was one of the people who were die-hard Final Fantasy fanatics way before the mainstream hype . Furthermore , I was a fan of FF7 way before it got all hyped-up . While FF6 is still my favorite , the sheer magnitude of revolutionary changes that this game brought about , not only for the franchise , but for the industry altogether , make this game well-deserving of its current fan-base , and subsequent prequel and sequel . The story is immersive and fulfilling for those interested in getting into the intricacies of it . The gameplay is original . The RPG aspects are unique . The graphics are tolerable , unless you are a picky , new-age gamer . One must keep in mind that for it 's time , the graphics and CGI cut-scenes were extraordinary . This game was the first to introduce the ultimate weapons and super-bosses to the franchise . Although , it is the first to keep them attainable and within reason . No obnoxious grinding or farming necessary to attain victory . Just the classic strategies and game play that make Final Fantasy great.Anyone hesitant because of its current status , or its vintage status , or any other reason , should give it a chance . I can assure any respectable gamer that they will be pleasantly surprised by this outstanding title . Greatest game ever to some ; outstanding adventure to me .	1
I love FFVII , it 's my favorite RPG . I bought this because my old copy was damaged . The replacement worked well and was much cheaper than any I found in game stores .	1
I love this game . It is absolutely THE BEST vg i have ever played.Follow the life of Cloud Strife , an ex-soldier who joins AVALANCHE , a club who is full of crime fighting agents such as Tifa , Barret and Yuffie . One time on a dangerous mission , he meets Aeris , a flower girl from the slums.they THEN set out on an adventure to defeat Shinra !	1
Unquestionbly the best RPG ever , and a strong candidate for the best game ever , Square 's Playstation-debut 'Final Fantasy 7 ' still stands the test of time today as one of their strongest titles in recent memory , and a sort of 'How-To ' guide to getting computer games right.Released in 1997 on a tidal wave of publicity , rumours ( remember the memory card debate ? ? ) and expectations , Final fantasy 7 took people 's preconceptions of the genre and utterly redefined them . Gone were the traditional top-down viewpoints , the 1-dimensional characters , and the boring spell effects , and we watched in amazement at hitherto-unparalleled graphics and a completely revolutionary storyline showed us exactly how good a RPG could be . Winning legions of new fans over to the genre , FF 7 fully deserved it 's blockbusting , best-selling status.FF 7 follows the story of Cloud Strife , a young mercenary-for-hire , and his attempts to stop his ex-colleague and nemesis Sephiroth from destroying the world . Along the way he meets some memorable characters , makes friends and discovers who he truly is.The strongest selling point of FF 7 at the time of it 's release was the graphics , which today , understandably , have been surpassed several times over . However , some moments in the game still hold their own against the modern consoles , and for a seven year-old game , that 's no small feat . What remains today is one of the best storylines ever , coupled with some of the smoothest game mechanics in videogaming history.The emotion behind the characters of Aeris , Cloud , Sephiroth etc. , is something which games developers have only recently started to latch on to - for example , 'Silent Hill 2 ' and 'Fatal Frame ' go deep into the psychology of emotion - but in a character and story-driven game like FF 7 , the depth of attachment we form with the characters is simply amazing . It 's impossible to treat FF 7 as a piece of retro-gaming , such is the depth of development behind the storyline . It tackles subjects like political upheaval , religion , self-worth - and does it all in such a way as to force us to mentally attach ourselves to the little people running about on the screen.The gameplay , too , is superb , with an easy menu system and full in-game tutorials being accessible at pretty much any point in the game . The difficulty level is pitched exactly right , there 's a steady learning curve and monsters and battles become significantly harder as you progress , but not so hard as to be prohibitive . Puzzles and secrets abound , and each time you play ( and you WILL play it multiple times ) you discover several new features that you did n't see before . With typical Square finnesse , the game options are customisable so battles and cut-scenes don ; t have to take up too much time , and the whole game moves at a speed which you , the player , dictate.I ca n't rave enough . Possibly equalled in terms of absorbing entertainment only by it 's own sequels , FF 7 is still a rewarding , hugely entertaining , and very special game . Totally recommended .	1
That 's my story and I 'm sticking to it . If you were to only have 3 final fantasies get those 10 , 7 and 6 ( aka 3 ) also 5 was pretty fun	1
I could tell right at the beginning when the game started , that I was going to have fun playing it . It grabs you immediately , along with the looks that I had never seen before . It is easy to give this game a perfect 10 because when I played Final Fantasy VII it was more fun , best looking , and a huge free roaming world , I had ever experience . I loved all the vehicles that were in the game , along with the music . If you have never played this game , I believe you would have fun just because of the story line along with the superior game play , which is the most important , aspect right ! The game is not hard to figure out in terms of fighting and leveling up so getting right to the game play is what you do . It is near and dear to my heart .	1
I had purchased a Playstation months before this title came out , specifically anticipating a great upgrade of the Super Nintendo titles Squaresoft had been producing up til this point . This game far exceeded my hopes and wishes , impressing me with the 3D characters , the story , the materia system , even the music . It 's what rewarded me for waiting and choosing Sony for my new gaming platform . I 've been a great fan of their games that followed , especially their landmark success Final Fantasy X for the PS2.The game has an interesting plot , compelling characters , and many challenges and secrets to discover . It also has a few plot twists that add spice . If you have n't played this game or those that have followed , PLEASE start here ! It just gets better from this point on ...	1
This is the huge game were taling about its so huge that your twisted mind will only focus at game and figure your huge mind its the best Rpg better then FFX ! -Graphics= ( 7-10 ) It may be a little bad but hey its Old ! -Gameplay= ( Unlimited-10 ) Over Your Big head-Disks ( 3 ) it has 3 compacked adventure Cd-Roms And this is the first 3 disk continued game ! This is always your thumps up games And if u hate it then u are not AN RPG PLAYER I REPEAT U ARE NOT A RPG player	1
I was in high school when this game came out . I saw the commercials . I was little confused about the title ( what happened to Final Fantasies 4 through 6 ? ? ? ) , but the game looked cool . I wanted it.I did not have a psx , though . However , my best friend did . A week after he bought it , he invited me over , and he showed me the game . I was hooked by the time Cloud and Barrett rushed off the train.I had to have the game . It was like no other Final Fantasy . The characters and the environments were so vivid ... so REAL.I left my friend 's house with a burning desire to own this game and the knowledge of what had happened to Final Fantasies 4 through 6 ( or Final Fantasies 2 , 3 , and 5 ) .After a few months of saving I had enough money , and I bought the Playstation , a memory card , and Final Fantasy 7.All in all , the game kept me riveted until the very end . The presentation was incredible . The story was intriguing . The game , for me , was an absolutely breath-taking experience.Really , the only turn-offs for me were a handful of instances where the translation was confusing and some weird instances of homosexual innuendo ( honestly , that was more comical than detracting ) .By today 's standards , the graphics are dated , but I still play through this game from time to time , and I thoroughly enjoy it every time .	1
When I played this it was magic . Journey back to the mid-life of the PlayStation . No , not the PlayStation 2 , the original PlayStation . Yes , to the kids who were born just before the release of the PlayStation 2 and are now reviewing FFVII against games on the PS2 and Xbox , there really was a previous version of the PS2 . It was a greyish top loading CD based ( yes ! CD ! ) system with no USB or iLink ( FireWire/1394 for the PC crowd ) . After the end of Final Fantasy games on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System by Nintendo ( yes , there really was a system called SNES that came before the Game Cube and for you old foagies among us , the N64 ( Nintendo 64 ) ) Final Fantasy finally got the 3D treatment for the first time . Or at least the characters did . The backgrounds were pre-rendered textures . That is the backgrounds were n't true 3D , they were rendered on a computer in 3D and then a snapshot of them at a certain angle was taken and slapped behind characters who were complete 3D rendered internally by the original PlayStation ( remember , the system that came from Sony before the PS2 ) . Only because the PlayStation could n't render fully 3D extremely detailed environments by itself . Up until FFVII , which , by the way , was not the first Final Fantasy to be developed ( there were other 2D ( two-dimensional ) offerings that only people who are long dead or are old and senile will remember , ask your great , great , great grandfather if he remembers playing Final Fantasy on his Nintin'do Entur-Tain'Mant Sih'stim back in the trenches during WWII ) , there was a real worry that Squaresoft ( as Square-Enix was called back then ) really had abandoned Final Fantasy games in favor of simple graphic demos on completely unknown systems like the N64 . Not so . Those demos were actually distractions from the truth . That Square-Enix ... errr ... I mean , Squaresoft was readying its Final Fantasy XII demo called Final Fantasy VII on the equally unknown PlayStation ( or as some Amish like to call it , the PSX ) . But at that time the network feature was n't fully implemented which made for a lonely playing experience for some already lonely and pathetic super-nerds out there . But for us old timers it was a blast seeing Final Fantasy in 3D finally . However , we did n't get the demo but unfortunately we got the fully playable game . Which was great in and of itself . Because it showed what was possible with the Final Fantasy franchise which would n't be fully realized until late 2004 when all gamers finally proclaim in one voice & quot ; What ? Another Final Fantasy game ? I thought they discontinued it back when Roman caesars ruled the known reality/universe and mammoths roamed computer generated alien landscapes & quot ; . Oh well , anything before Doom 3 is going to vanish from the collective memory of computer-gamedom anyway so do n't play this because you wo n't be able to . It 's just too alien an experience for today 's DDR generation ( oh , for those fetuses unfamiliar with DDR it 's & quot ; Dance Dance Revolution & quot ; and it 's what today 's elderly play when their hips are n't healing fast enough ) .BTW , stop being putzes and review the game fairly and in its own context of time . It looks really dumb when someone starts comparing it to something so far advanced it 's not even fair . Perspective , my children . Get some .	1
Final Fantasy 7 is in my opinion , the best game in the entire series . The graphics are crisp , the gameplay is as fun as any other FF game and the music is epic . This is nearly a perfect game .	1
I borrowed this game from a friend and it wasAWSOME ! ! ! ! ! ! ! It has all the stuff I liked.I dont get how people are dissing this game for its graphics ! HELLO YOU IDIOTS IT WAS MADE IN 1997 ! ! ! ! It was made along time ago but for that time the graphics aretop notch . The game is 3 disk andenjoyable for all.Get the game ! ! !	1
Now let me begin by saying I 'M NOT AN RPG gamer , I borrowed this from a friend because I was hearing so much about how great this game is , I recently borrowed it during the summer and I must say I ... LOVE..THIS ... GAME . I mean at first I was n't into the plot ( I started getting sucked into it as soon as I got to Disc 2 ) and the game aswell but after a few hours of playing I WAS HOOKED , now as I stated before I am not an RPG gamer but this game had one of those really cool anime/type plots and the turned base battles were pretty cool . The gameplay was pretty fun and I was always excited to see were the game would take me next , the dialoug IF YOU ASK me was a little dumb , I mean just because Barret is african american every most of the things he says has to always be spelled differently and have 4 letter words ? Ok I 'm done gripping . Other then Plot and gameplay , I really liked how the materia/magic worked aswell as the summons ( man they are such a treat to look at ) . And I think I 'm going abit too far but I thought the CG scenes ( though very limited in the game ) were beautiful . As for visuals , I do n't see why people are saying this games visuals are terrible this game was made back in the mid 90 's ! ! ! I thought the visuals were great ! And the pre rendered backrounds were great aswell ! Stop complaining it 's an old game ! Now audio ... .I kid you not , after beating this game I downloaded almost every song from the game ( Cosmo Canyon is by far one of my favorite songs ever played on a video game ! ! ! ) . The music is just beautiful , the song played in cosmo canyon is let alone a reason to get the game sountrack as well as the final battle with Sepheroth . The best part about the audio is they fit perfectly well for every scenario/area/battle . I do plan on buying this games soundtrack when I have the time..Now being my first RPG I do n't know what to expect but I 'll say it anways..my first time through this game was pretty long , I never went through EVERY SIDE QUEST but I did do a few cause I was a little paranoid that I 'd mess up , from random battles to leveling up , Boss battles to getting to every place/land/cave that I went through to progress through this great game and my length went down to a total of 57 hours , so yes you bet your sweet keester that your first time through this game will take awhile , as it is spanning 3 discs . Ok I 'm getting tired lets just get this over withThe Good-I LOVE THE MUSIC IN THIS GAME-The CG in this game is just wonderful-Why are people complaining about visuals , they get a 9 on my book.. well for it 's time atleast..-The Turn based battles were pretty fun-Omnislash ... ..nuff said-The Summons were a treat to see ( VIVA LA BAHUMUT ZERO ! ) -I loved all the characters so much in this game , it 's like you cared for them and really wanted them to just survive through the game , especially Red XII ( My favorite Character in the game ) -3 disc , more then 40 hours of gameplay and tons of stuff to do to extend the time period of the games lengthThe bad-I would ... seriously , no joke , just jump out of my seat when a random battle happend , I think it 's cause I had my volume very high-The random battles do get annoying-I thought leveling up did get pretty annoying and boring at parts ( I was worried that I had to be in a certain level so I can be strong enough for a boss so I 'd spend like 50 % of the game leveling up ) Other then that I really liked this game , I loved the music , visuals , story , especially the characters and the whole world/atmosphere was beautiful and there is n't anything that really botherd me except for a few boss battles ... other then that this is a must own for the Playstation . In the end I give this fantastic game a ... 5 out of 5 stars ...	1
This was by far my favorite RPG game ! all the other final fantasies and others are good but this one just blew me away ! the graphics may not be the best but the touching and unforgettable storyline makes up for that . the characters are soo cool and if someone tried to improve this game it would beVERY hard because it 's already perfect . I 'd definetly recomend this game.. i 've played tons of video games and this is still my fav . even though it 's older ! !	1
OK , i know this game is supposedly the best game ever . It even says so on the back of the disc case as `` quite possibly the greatest game ever made '' ( GameFan ) . I can agree that this is indeed a superb game with a great storyline , it 's just that some things in the game drag it down , which is why i gave it four stars . Let 's start with the Pros.Pros : An excellent storyline ( one that 's far easier to understand than FF VIII ) that truly brings out the characters and their moving development . The multitude of characters are also a big plus . Everyone from the uber-sweet folk like Ester and Marlene all the way to the downright evil Heidegger and Sephiroth , with everyone else falling somewhere in the vast expanse between the two . Some characters are even evil , yet you feel sympathy for them . Characters like Dyne who only wants to see his daughter again , or Cait Sith , a member of your party who 's actually ( SPOILER SPOILER ) a robot controlled from a guy in Shinra HQ , yet he tries to be on the good side ... most of the time . The music is another huge plus in this game . Tunes such as Aeris ' theme and the Boss Fight theme will be in your head for hours at a time . The sound effects are also a plus , most of which , if you 're playing with surround sound , put you right in the game . The graphics are also very good for a PSOne game , with cut-scenes that look better than most PS2 games nowadays . The Materia system is probably the best magic system I 've ever seen in a FF game , although FFX 's thing with the orbs on the little map is also an excellent version . It gives the player a true ability to customize the character for particular bosses , i.e. , before fighting a particularly tough Turk , you can equip your weapon to attack AND induce poison at the same time . The game also has an IMMENSE level of replay value . After you 've gone through and beaten the final boss , you can go back and get all the Enemy Skills , collect each materia , raise a gold chocobo , defeat the Emerald and Ruby weapons ( I 've done it , it IS possible ) , get each Master Materia , raise each characters limits to level 4 , get the secret characters Yuffi and Vincent , go to the Gold Saucer and waste some time and money , and many other challenges , such as beating the game again using only green materia or never saving except between discs ( do n't even try this unless you have a good tolerance for frustration ) . Replay value , a definite plus . OK , now for the bad news ... Cons : The gameplay can get very , Very , VERY boring . Moments in the game take a complete departure from the action and elaborate on the storyline for much too long . ( SPOILER SPOILER ) Tifa 's trip in Cloud 's consciousness is a perfect example of this where over an hour is taken to reveal whether or not Cloud is a Sephiroth clone . You ca n't save the game anywhere in it , so you 're stuck having to listen to this hour-long monologue , especially sucky if it 's your 2nd time playing the game and you already know whats gon na happen . The same is true for the small , menial side-stories that are supposed to bring out more of a certain character , but actually just distract from the main storyline at times , such as the whole thing with Barret and the folks of Corel . The sound effects , although good , are very repetitive . Each character 's attack weapon has the same sound , no matter which version of the weapon is being used . The music can also be repetitive and sometimes lacking . Sometimes , yes , it 's perfectly fitting to have a section with no music at all or only a low cello voice with a bass drum in the background , but why on Earth did Nobuo Uematsu decide to have no music for the snowboarding segments ? ! ? Also , for some reason they put fairly light-hearted BGM in the section where the team is lost in the snow , a scene that could 've taken a lesson from the snow levels in Donkey Kong Country for the SNES . Oh well ... OK , so it 's not the best game in the world ( I personally think Zelda : OoT is the best ) , but it is definitely worth the 20 bucks you 'll pay for a new copy .	1
I 'll admit , the first time I ever played this game , I was n't that into it . The main reason was that there , in my opinion , too many damn mini-games that were kinda hard ( I STILL ca n't figure out how to get in line with the soldiers at the parade in I think Junon ) . Also , the music , while very emotional , is very very sad . So is the story ... it got a little depressing to me.But that was the first time I played it . Now I 'm playing it again ( this is my third time and I just beat the game about 6 months ago ) , and I 'm finding the mini-games are n't quite as difficult ; I 'm not getting lost nearly as much , and I 've got ta say the music 's not quite so depressing anymore either . Also , I think it helps to play Crisis Core ( PSP prequel to the game ) or at least watch Advent Children ( movie whose plot takes place about 2 years after the events of the PS game ) . The story is still quite sad , but it works . I think anyone who is into RPGs will definitely enjoy this one .	1
Final Fantasy VII is a good game to play . It is difficult at some points in the game . I started 3 times just to overcome the beginning of the game and to progress to the continuation of the story . The story line is good . I especially like the stealing of items from monsters , to see what all you can get , sometimes a weapon or just healing items . Sofar I , m just at the stage where I left the city , and roaming the world map . I 'm trying to get more familiar with it . It will take me a long time to finish this game , since it has 3 discs , maybe I 'll never finish it .	1
Final Fantasy 7 is a masterpiece . What a cliche ! Masterpiece ; a term suggesting the undisputed magnum opus of an already venerable company . Many things gain this mark , but few live up to their expectation . Final Fantasy 7 does.In many ways , Final Fantasy 7 is far from perfect . The graphics , compared to today , are dated , grainy , and harsh . The storyline reeks of cliche-ridden overtones . The characters seem generic . However , this is all a product of subsequent games.Final Fantasy 7 defined the 3D graphical engine used in almost all of today 's RPGs . Its characters , still fresh , were very unique , emotionally unstable , and enjoyable to read about . The storyline spins off numerous tangents and undertones that suggested a fully functioning , realistic world that presents real-life human troubles.This is far from a typical RPG . From its conception , it redefined the genre and introduced the RPG to about 3 million new gamers . Saying that Final Fantasy 7 single-handedly elevated RPGs from niche to mainstream status would be far from an erraneous statement.Considering all of these things , a person skeptical about playing Final Fantasy 7 should grant reconsideration . Though it is far from the prettiest and most unique of games , it does represent the model that all of today 's successful RPGs follow . And , in this case , the model is more radiant than its spinoffs .	1
Thanks for this classic Final Fantasy game . This will be the first 3 disk long rpg I 've played though but who cares . It 's great !	1
WELLLLLL ... THIS IS YOUR TICKET ! Final Fantasy VII is the ultimate in what is the most successful ( and also greatest ) series of role-playing games of all time ! There are all sorts of pros to the game , but only a few cons ... and the cons barely matter ! Pros : -An incredible story.-Deep and engaging play.-Beautiful battle graphics and CG cinemas.-Plenty of subquests.-VERRRRY lengthy ! -Unique characters.-Hollywood-worthy music.-Plenty of plot-twists.Cons ( there are few ) : -Sometimes a bit tedious-Battle system is a bit flawed.-Terrible land animation.-If you devote your life to gaming , you may have to say goodbye to your family and friends.The bottom line : this is an altogether gaming masterpiece spanning three discs of epic conflict , timeless romance , and magical battles . If your forte in gaming is roleplaying in general or the Final Fantasy series , then I highly recommend this game ! P.S.WOW . I ca n't believe how much the price of this game has SKYROCKETED . I 'm lucky I bought this game when it cost a whopping $ 15.00 ! People if you have this game by all means HANG ON TO IT !	1
When My friend told me about this game , I was like whateva . When he went home he left it at my house . I decided to se what it was all 'bout . When I played it , I started to enjoy it , and I played it for 5 hours , 'till I got dizzy . There where a few problems , but I did n't give ... 'bout it , cuz I enjoyed the obsorbing storyline , and gameplay . Pros and Cons of the gane wherePros : A Storyline that is maxed out to 90 hours7 characters that are wit ' uGreat FMV SequenceMakes u wan na git everything at the end before u fight SephrothAlot of bad language for a game thats rated T ; I like thatA beutiful 3D backround , and world mapMakes u wan na play for hoursCons : Too many random battlesGraphics on characters are outdated ( Looks like little kids runninTakes too long to git limit breakNo talking at allTakes too long to level up materia	1
This game is one of the greatest Rpgs , or games ever ! And now that it is only 20 $ you must buy it ! And whatever you do spend your money on this game not 8 ( blech ! ) The characters are great with the magic system dealing with materia which have different spells and effects so in other words your characters are all costomizible . The plot is great , always surprising and pretty scary ! This game is worth every single cent when you buy it , and its only twenty bucks .	1
Sure , the word & quot ; epic & quot ; is thrown around a lot on the back covers of games , but this game really is one . Of course , you can probably tell that from the fact that it 's three discs long . From the great music to the excellent battle system to the plot with a depth rarely seen in video games to the wonderful graphics ... okay , so the graphics are n't wonderful . In fact , they suck . The exception to the graphics comes in the fairly cool looking occasional movie scenes . Not being a huge RPG fan , I took the fairly direct route through the game . RPG extremists have a ton more to do , from raising chocobos to fighting that ( expletive deleted ) Ruby Weapon . Also , the special attacks are really cool . They range from fancy swordfighting techniques like cross-slash to a guy who turns into popular horror movie characters ( a Jason imitation , complete with chainsaw , helped me defeat Safer Sephiroth ) . Anyway , this is a great game that is worth more than twenty bucks , so get it .	1
I was in 7th grade when this came out . I saved up and bought it . I 've played through it many times . This game not only brought the console RPG 's into the spot light but it also brought A LOT of fun to millions of fans.Ignore all of these peole saying it 's `` nothing special '' because they compare it to everything that came after it . In 1997 this game was TON of fun , but if you are going to buy it now and expect bells and whistles like all the more current RPG 's then you will be disapointed . I have nothing bad to say about FF7 , it 's a great game and will always be one of my all time favorites .	1
I found the only challenge to be the weapons and the final showdown with sephiroth . This was a great game but way to easy to play because i played Phantasy Star prior to this . On the other hand it had a slew of extra missions and hidden items and stuff to play for . Find the ribbons and sephiroth will be a lot easier to fight . I found two . The graphics were terrible , lets not lie ok ... and to add insult to injury there was never a remake . In a way it makes me hate the game a bit more than i already do , even though it was a game i spent most my time with ... .	1
Ilove this game , its its just breathtaking . It has a great story , but the graphics could have had a bit of work . If you love a good RPG get this game . I said get this game ! ! ! !	1
This Final Fantasy 7 is one of the most influenced games of all time . The fan bases for this one game blows out all FF fan base out of the water . Never has any other FF game seen such an influenced with multiple related games/story characters found in different games . Multiple Movies . Toys , cards , etc based on this game . Why was that all necessary for this one game ? It 's just that DAMN AWESOME ! This game has everything ! Story , characters , battle system , music , humor and more ! If it did n't why else did this game influenced so many other things that followed it after ? Because it was just damn awesome ! You can play this game over and over before getting tried of it , but you will keep it in your hearts forever . The amazing game play , the amazing characters , and amazing graphics . ( Back in those days . ) They just ca n't make anything that even comes close to what they did back then . I wish they did , but they ca n't ! It was just too well done ! lol	1
I think that this is truly one of the best rpg 's of all time for the PS . It is very fun and addicting I have played it for around 60 hours and it is still good . It takes a while to beat and get everything so you should play this game for a good amount of time so it is worth buying . Also the summonings in this game are cool . The only down side is that the cg 's they are alright for when it came out but now . Other than that this is proably one of the best games I have ever played for the PS .	1
The first Final Fantasy on a system is always the best , as it seems to bring out the best in Square 's developers . Final Fantasy VII is no different , with the perfect amount of Playstation flair to compliment , not overtake the strong story and game system that are the series ' hallmarks.While old-school gamers may prefer pre-defined roles for each character , the Materia system is still meritorious on its own , allowing uncomplicated customization of characters and adding great depth to gameplay . Character development proceeds well , with nearly every battle in the game having purpose ( unlike some RPGs where hours are spent `` leveling up '' to get characters past an obstacle ) , and the in-game pointers help clarify locations whenever the lush graphics are unclear . The soundtrack is otherworldly , with several haunting , beautiful songs that are simply unforgettable.But Final Fantasy 's core has always been its great storylines , and this installment has one of the best . Characters develop and mature realistically , and you get to know each one intimately , almost feeling kinship with some of them . The plot is suitably but not comically epic , and the main struggle plays out better than most Hollywood movies . Nearly everyone will laugh and cry at various parts of the game , a feat precious few video games have ever accomplished . From a storyteller 's perspective the shocking twist at the game 's midpoint is perhaps too easy a way to draw emotion from the player , but there is no denying its effectiveness , as it is one of the most memorable scenes in video game history.Square has released many RPGs on Playstation , some of them terrific on their own , but none have topped their first , a must-purchase for all Playstation owners . If you like incredible stories but do n't own a Playstation , it 's worth buying one just for Final Fantasy VII .	1
By far the BEST final fantasy ever madeIt was the first FF to be made on psx and the gameplay graphics were OK . But the CG graphics were really REALLY good.I was speechless at the end of the game where everything comes together and the big twist is revealed . That was awesome.So basically I give it 100 stars cuz I LOOOVE it .	1
This is a fantastic game . Its got a great storyline full of twists and turns . It has a lot of optional dungeons and bosses an optional characters too . Its your average 40 hours but obtaining the gold chocobo and gttings couds final limit break can be chalenging and take hours themselves . I recommend this game .	1
bought the game cause i love the series and shockingly this game is the same age as i am feel great to hold a piece of gaming history in my hands storys great every aspect of the game is great	1
This is the best game ever . It 's more than a game , it 's more a way of life . It draws you in and you feel part of the whole gaming experience , something that Final Fantasy VIII fails to do . The storyline is immense , the characters are varied , there is a piloe , a dog type lion beast , a cat on a mog and an Ancient , unlike the sequel where everyone is a human . Materia collecting is fun , the fights are testing , the towns and destinations are varied , the world map is huge ( until you get the Highwind ) and the sub games are superb.The only fault with the graphics are the on screen characters which are too cartoony . Apart from that though , the graphics are brilliant , the music is one of the best soundtracks ever and the gameplay and lifespan are both excellent . Defenitly worth the money . Buy it now .	1
classic storyline , good music , sweet battle system . One of , if not the , best game ever made .	1
There 's nothing much to say about this game ... it 's the best game I 've ever played , and ... well , if you have a PS or PS2 and you do not have this game you are stupid . Go and buy it NOW ! ! !	1
This game is very fun . Though this game does have graphics that are n't nearly as good as , say , Final Fantasy X or Final Fantasy XII , it is still an extremely fun and addicting game . I would suggest this game to any one who likes video games and owns a playstation .	1
-- -GRAPHICS : 4 of 5 -- -MOVIES : 5 OF 5The graphics for the opening sequence was amazing - a huge jump from the graphics in FF 6 . Right from the start you could tell that the graphics for this game was going to be of a level that we had never seen before on SNES.WORLD MAP : 5 OF 5The 3-D , rotatable graphics on the world map was also amazing - there were times I would just walk around just to look at the graphics - it really felt like I was there.BATTLE : 5 OF 5* It was really nice to see a character with realistic proportions fight instead of the deformed chibis we saw in FF 6 and before . * It was really cool how the characters flashed before doing a limit break . Reminds me of Street Fighter characters right before they do a super combo . * It was interesting how each character had a different winning pose . * A movie for the summons was nice , although it got time-consuming after a while.EVERYWHERE ELSE : 1 OF 5Outside of the movies and world map field , the characters were so tiny they were hard to see . I ca n't count the number of times I got lost . And when there was a closeup of the characters , they were very blocky and of low quality . Even if the graphics are beautiful , if I ca n't see where my characters and the exits are , then it 's more of a hindrance than a sight to behold. -- -MUSIC : 4 of 5 -- -Some of the songs for this soundtracks are the best video game music I 've ever heard - in fact , my most listened to song on my iPod is the world map theme song , which I 've listened to over 2,000 times . I also like the Battle music , the music on the bridge ( slower version of theme song ) , Anxiety , the opening movie theme song , and Yuffie 's hometown song.The only reason I give the music 4 of 5 is because some of the music was annoying , such as the slum music . Was I happy to get out of there. -- -STORY & CHARACTERS : 5 OF 5 -- -PROS : * Cloud , Aeris , Tifa , Barrett , and Yuffie are easily among my most favorite video game characters of all-time . * The date scene for all of the characters was interesting and even very humorous depending on what choices you made . * Aeris was developed so well that she was the reason I cried while playing a video game . * I also like some of the sub characters , like Elena , the man and woman with a distinctive laugh , and the boss who did n't like the man 's laugh . The only other sub characters I 've ever liked are Tanya from DQ 6 and Gilgamesh from FF 5 . To have 4 interesting sub characters come from a single game is simply amazing character development.CONS : * Cloud 's memory loss was implausible and confusing . * Whatever happened to Sepiroth in the end to become whatever he became was so confusing I still do n't understand what happened to him to this day . * I do n't understand why a mechanic is an expert with the spear . * Vincent was developed poorly - he was not memorable to me at all . * Stats wise , the characters are n't different enough . It does n't really matter who you give materia to , they can still be just as effective as the next character if certain stats boosts like HP up are added.Despite the flaws , any video game that can make me cry deserves a 5 of 5 for story & character development. -- -BATTLE SYSTEM : 5 OF 5 -- -This is hands down the best battle system I 've ever seen.PROS : * Pace that abilities and spells are learned is perfect with the ability system and slots . * The types of combos that could be made with the materia was simply amazing . * The idea of using slots helped to minimize any single character from becoming overpowered . * Limit Breaks was a very innovative idea.CONS : * Having more than 1 of each materia could lead to insane overpowering , such as having 8 counters . * Most of the Limit Breaks are the same - they just do damage . I wish there was more variety . * Summons could use more variety - 3 Bahamuts were excessive . I missed the Golem and Carbunkle . * Getting the materia that had a lot of abilities in it led to overpowering characters . * Only 3 characters in at a time without being able to switch out hurt.Although this system had some flaws , it 's clearly the best I 've ever seen before and since . I really wish the later FF games improved on this to make it perfect. -- -MINI GAMES : 3 OF 5 -- -PROS : * I really loved the Snowboarding & Condor Fort.CONS : * I died multiple times trying to beat the submarine mini game . * Some of the mini games were annoying to beat , like doing the correct soldier moves . Can I just defeat a tough monster instead of playing these silly games ? -- -CONCLUSION : 5 of 5 -- -FF 7 is by no means a perfect game and has its share of flaws . However , the good points of this game outshine the flaws to such a point that I have no choice to give it a 5 of 5 . I never thought in my wildest dreams that a video game could make me cry . Clearly one of the best games I 've ever played in my life .	1
Pros+A Very Deep , Engrossing and Heartfelt story+Memorable characters+Very Customizable game+Enriching soundtrack+Very detailed cinematics and incredible looking pre-rendered backgrouns+Tons and tons of optional things to doCons-The characters may be memorable , but the game does little to develop them beyond a certain point-There 's no big incentive to use one character over another-It may very well be one of the easiest Final Fantasy games in the seriesAfter eleven years , Final Fantasy VII still manages to be a beast in the RPG field . Boasting a colossal story and a few memorable characters . Final Fantasy VII is the game which made the JRPG genre big in the West and eleven years later it still ranks as one of the greatest games of all time.Final Fantasy VII centers on Cloud Strife . A mercenary who has joined the rebelious group known as AVALANCHE , who are taking on the Shinra Corporation , that is slowly draining the planet of its life . The story all comes together by Cloud 's mysterious past , a terrifying villain and some heartfelt characters . The story of Final Fantasy VII spans so much more than just an evil Corporation . You 'll eventually find yourself on a journey that involves you saving the world . Even compared to today , Final Fantasy VII is an RPG that breaks the rules of traditional storytelling . Rather than being a band of teenagers out to stop some evil adults ( as the JRPG has been drowned out in in recent years ) , Final Fantasy VII puts you in the role of characters about something more . If there were any criticism of the story , it would be that it 's a lot to take in . Some things never really come together in the end and you 'll be left with a lot of burning questions . Much of this , you can bet , is due to some of Final Fantasy VII 's shoddy translation . There were some pieces in the localization process that were left out entirely and make the story come off as a little more sloppy than it was intended to . Another small criticism comes with its characters . While they 're memorable , they often times take a backseat to some of the stories progression . Once we learn what we need to learn about certain characters , the game never really touches them or makes them integral to the plot itself again . If it were n't for their stark personalities , funny quips and own charms , you might forget them.Ever since Final Fantasy IV , the series has used the ATB battle system and Final Fantasy VII is no exception . Every character has an ATB gauge that lets them take action once it 's filled . Pretty basic , but Final Fantasy VII gets a bump by being very customizable . The Materia system allows for nearly endless possibilities for its characters . There are several different kinds of Materia . There 's your basic magic materia that give you spells to cast , but there is also materia to give you more battle commands such as being able to steal or throw items at an enemy . There are other materia there just to boost your stats and others that enhance your spells by giving you the ability to hit all the enemies at once or to absorb health from your enemies . There are far more in each category and they give you infinite ways to play Final Fantasy VII.Without materia , though , your characters are naked and can only attack . This brings about small problem . The first being that there 's is no incentive to use any one character above another . Final Fantasy VII remedies this by givng its character ultra powerful limit breaks . Every character has a limit gauge and when it fills up as they take damage . When full they can let forth a brutal attack . Characters also have limit levels for different limit breaks and the higher the Limit Level the more damage you have to take before its full . Unfortunately , this is all that makes any character different in battle . Materia gives them legs , but you can always transfer over anyone else 's materia to anyone else . In the long run this wo n't bother anyone , but it leads to a lack of variety in the characters and you more than likely wo n't need limit breaks that much to begin with . Final Fantasy VII 's pros more than outnumber the cons . The amount of customization is great , but it still would 've been nice to need one character 's ability over another.Final Fantasy VII is by no means a hard game . It is arguably one of the easiest games in the series . In particular , the final battle turns out to be one of the easiest fights in the game against someone who has often been labeled one of the most threatening in history . Yet Final Fantasy VII makes for that with several hidden goodies . You wo n't find too many optional dungeons in Final Fantasy VII , but you will find an incredible number of optional things to do off the beaten path . From breeding and racing Chocobos , to finding hidden materia , to taking on ultra powerful bosses and even finding hidden characters who have more than just a face , but actually play into the story itself . There are more secrets in Final Fantasy VII than even most RPGs of today.Graphically Final Fantasy VII is a mixed bag . In 1997 these graphics were phenominal . the pre-rendered backgrounds are still incredible looking even to this day . The seventh Final Fantasy has a lot of style . The polygons are charming though they do n't look as cool as the rest of the environments . The FMVs are still amazing and wonderfully detailed for its time . There are a couple of moments of slowdown with Final Fantasy VII , however , and some of the summon animations can get lengthy and repetitive . But they do n't take away from its wildly detaile environments.The music score may actually be the most rewarding thing for Final Fantasy VII . The music score manages to fill the situations for the right moment . But it also is n't afraid to showcase a lot of emotion either . There are some moments where it can be dark and others where it 's very light . In particular , the character themes are really nice and memorable . Final Fantasy VII does n't have the best soundtrack within the series , but it has some of the most memorable music numbers of the entire series.After eleven years Final Fantasy VII is still a force to be reckoned with . There are a few gaps in its storyline that you may have to read a bit more deeply to learn about ( as not all of it is within the game itself , but if anything confuses you there have been countless FAQs written as well as spin-offs and sequels ) and it shuns some of its characters at points , but the package is still one of the best Playstation outings of all time , and every gamer should pick up and play Final Fantasy VII at least once .	1
This game really & quot ; IS & quot ; the best game in existance . It is just wonderful , great , best ... I could go on like this telling how good it is , however , I can only put 1,000 words in my review . This game almost makes it to being perfect ( almost ) . Here are my ratings and my discription of this game.Graphics . 3 1/2 Stars : Graphics are alright . When it comes to how they look for 3D I would say & quot ; good & quot ; but for realism ( during game play ) I dunno . They ( Characters and people and things ) look ... not so good . However , the graphics during battles are very good ( also during cut scenes/movies ) Music : 4 stars : Really very good music.I espicially like the battle music and the ancient city/city of the ancients music . Oh , and the chocobo battle music.Story line : 5 stars : very good story line , alot of different things other than Shinra and Sepheroth.Characters:4 stars : I like most of the characters , except for Yuffie . Here is a hint , do n't look for her if you get this game.Overall : 5 stars : Only problems are : random battles can get anoying , you ca n't skip cutscenes ( I guess that 's not too bad but the movie at the begining I wish you could skip atleast ) , takes too long after birth or breeding for a chocobo to be able to breed again.You play ( well you actually play several characters ) Cloud Strife , an ex-member of Soldier ( kind of an army police sort of thing working for Shinra ) who has joined with a team Avalanche who are against Shinra ... a corporation that is draining mako energy out of the planet with reactors ( without mako energy the planet will die ) . But what starts out as a mission against Shinra becomes a struggle to save the world . It 's more than that , though , so I will leave you to find out for yourself . There are alot of side quests too . Like chocobo breeding ( Oh yeah , You got ta try that ) or the gold saucer which is like a big arcade.Disregard all negative reviews about this game ( they do n't know what there talking about ) . Go out and get this game ... and if you do n't have a PS ( Playstation ) get one just for this game.So go out and get Final Fantasy 7 NOW !	1
That is a quote from the back of the jewel but I wasnt quite sure to believe it . I saw it in stores 5 years ago , had heard all of the hype and figured I 'd spend the 50 bucks to get it . It was one of the best 50 I have ever spent . Now wait a sec , dont think this review is just biased raving claiming this to be the best game ever of all time and for the rest of time . While at this point I would like to say that , I realize that saying it wouldnt help much , so I 'll focus on the actual game.Okay , so it is from 1997 , and it is currently 2003 . That makes this game 6 years old . The graphics have to be pretty bad , right ? Wrong . While the realtime graphics do n't compare to current games , the cutscenes are FANTASTIC . Really , they are beautiful . Lots of games have the power to make great graphics , and they do , but these are put together like a movie in that the camera angles are great , the render engine is stunning , and not to mention the scene layouts are incredible . Some of the really great cut scenes dont come until later in the game , but you wont be bored during the wait . That brings me to the next subject . The gameplay is very well executed . It is a turn-based rpg , which means battles are seperate from when you walk around and such . Your moves are executed in the ATB ( active time battle ) system where you dont wait your turn , but rather a time meter fills up that determines when you attack , defend , cast a spell , etc.. There are several characters , you can cycle between who is in your party at most times and they each have their own strengths and weaknesses . Skill is aquired by gaining experience points and leveling up . You can also get better armor , shields , weapons , etc . Apart from the battle system , there is the final fantasy unique 'world map ' . It means that instead of having levels/stages/boards , you can explore , gain experience and level up , etc . by going wherever you want on , literally , an entire planet . Although the storyline restricts this at certain times.Okay , so now that we have the graphics stuff out of the way , let 's move on to the story . In my opinion , the story is the best part of the game . If no other part of this game remains the best for all time , then the story will . I truly believe that this is the best storyline EVER in a game . Although it is slightly cliched , I will say that it is a touching but exciting story about love and hate , good and evil , the horrible effects of an evil corporation 's technological expansion killing the planet , and very ORIGINAL story points that , unfortunately , trying to explain could very well ruin the game for you . You 're just gon na have to spend the 50 to find out . I would pay 100 if I knew how great it was gon na be.Finally , the music score . For a video game , this is unbelievable . FFVII pulled the game industry out of the horrible pit of MIDI blip sounds and other bad music , with a HUGE bound . The soundtrack is huge , every single song from the opening menu to the ending credits 70 hours later is absolutely incredible and I would venture to say epic . Each one is wonderfully written , ranging from lighthearted and happy to melancholy and sad to powerful cut scene tracks ( If you like them enough , they have an 80+ track soundtrack available ) .I could go on forever about how great all of these things are , but I imagine that the review readers would n't appreciate that , so I will cut the rest short.This game was stunning in 1997 , and it is stunning in 2003 . It is like no other game I have ever played , and is definately for a more mature crowd , as some kids would n't understand the plot , and some of the themes/language might not be very appropriate for kids . I am not kid bashing here . Some can understand it , but it is all maturity level that counts , not age . Just use discretion.As for weak points , good luck finding any , because I sure have n't . Well , I hope my review has helped you make a better choice . But for [ $ $ $ ] ? Come on , give it a try . You will at least be somewhat entertained for the 60 or 70 hours it takes to play all 3 discs . Happy gaming !	1
Final Fantasy is the most popular game in Japanese RPG game . The popularity is devide to Dragon Questo ( warrior ) in half . Final Fantasy1 is the work more than 10 years ago . The hard system was Nintendo Family computer these days . And in Final Fantasy 4 the hard changed to Super Family computer . In this Final 7 the hard changed to Play station . As my title , the hard spec extended very much by changed from Supaer famicon to Play station . Concletely the soft system changed from casette to CDROM . For that , the garafic and sound etc got to be very real . the difference of Final6-7 was remarkable more than other title of Final series.The most remakable difference was the changing from 2D to 3D . I memorized the first moving when I played Final7.Thank you for reading poor English .	1
FFVII is the best ! In this FF , you get to equip stones called materia and use abilities based on what the materia is . And the best part is , after a while , when you bring a materia to its higest level , it will form another materia of the same type . The amount of materia you can equip is based on what weapon you have equipped . And you can improve materia with other materia , on some occassions . There are five different types of materia : a ) Magic Materia : lets your character cast spellsb ) Command Materia : lets you character use commands such as Steal or Enemy Skill ( also known as Blue Magic ) c ) Independent Materia : gives your character improved stats or passive abilitiesd ) Summon Materia : lets you summon characters such as Ifrit or Shivae ) Support Materia : Allows you to add abilities to linked materiaThere is , however , one slight problem about a certain materia . In this game , there is a Support Materia called Elemental . What this materia does is it adds a connected materia 's element ( s ) to your attack ( if equipped on a weapon ) or protects you from connected elements ( if equipped on armor ) . The problem comes in play if you equip this to your weapon . If you run into an enemy who is strong against the element ( s ) that is/are attached to Elemental , you have no way to change the elemental properties that the weapon currently possesses . So , you may have to start back to your last save point if the situation gets really bad and all you can do is attack.This is the first FF to have `` Limits '' . Basically , this lets use a unique , and usually strong , move when you character takes enough damage , so it 's kind of like being in a rage . And as you use Limits more and more , you can get more and more different attacks you can use when you reach your Limit Break ( when you can use a Limit ) .If you do n't already have FFVII , hurry and get it ! You wo n't be disappointed .	1
I wanted this game so badly for years , so I finally just went for it . I heard it was one of the best games ever made , and it is true . I actually beat it today and am so happy . It was made in 1997 and still competes with games made today . It has a great story and some of the best characters ever . I got so attached to these characters . I wo n't get into too much detail because other reviewers already did a good job explaining that , but it truly is a great game . The graphics are fine for an old game , and I find the character design very charming . The game is really fun , too . I just could n't stop playing , I always was so excited to play more and see what would happen next . I even knew a good amount of what would happen ahead of time because of what I had read and seen , and it was still exciting . There is also a lot to do . After about 40 hours , I still have n't done everything.I have a few things I want to add . If you 're wondering if it works well on a PS2 . Yes , perfectly . And one more thing . I bought the game used , not greatest hits , and it had trouble because of the condition it was in , so I bought a new copy that is the greatest hits version . The older one comes with a case that is very annoying because it is really hard to get disc 2 out . I was worried about having to bend the disc to get it out . I would highly suggest buying the greatest hits version because the case is made better . All of the discs come out easily , so no disc bending.So in short , if you want to see what all the fuss is about , buy it and see . I loved it .	1
this is possible the greatest game ever , only out matched by super mario bros. 3 ! THis game is both challenging and fun . NUMBER 1 in my book of greatest hits for the PS1 !	1
Final Fantasy VII is easily my favorite Final Fantasy game , and I know them all . I own FFIV , V , VI , VII , VIII , IX , and X and have beaten FFVII , VIII , IX , and X and this one is the best . I have to recommend it to everyone , RPG fan or not . Squaresoft was at it 's prime in this period what with FFVII & Xenogears , my favorite Squaresoft games . The battle format is the tried and true Active form ( you have a `` Active Time Battle '' gauge that fills and when it fills , the character can attack . Enemies do n't have to wait for you to use your turn to use theirs ) . There are tons of commands ( Ex . Attack , Deathblow , Magic , Item , Morph , Steal , Mime , etc . ) but many require Materia to use . Materia is what you insert into your weapon and armors empty Materia slots to gain the Materias ability while it is equipped . You gain AP as well as EXP and Gil ( $ ) after winning a fight . AP levels up your equipped Materia . It is important not to overload your character with Materia though , because as Cloud says in a tutorial , `` It acts as a double-sided sword . While it gives you abilities , it also can subtract from your stats . '' The story starts small as a rebel group AVALANCHE fighting the Shinra Corporation that is turning the only huge city on Gaia , Midgar , into one big industrial market . They are putting up Mako Reactors that suck the energy from the Earth and convert it to power . AVALANCHE destroys a couple of these in missions and Shinra devises a plan . 18 year old Cloud is just joining AVALANCHE , but reluctantly ; he is very cruel hearted and troubled do to his past in the beginning , but that changes . Quickly the scheme becomes much more grandiose as Sephiroth gets involved . AVALANCHE falls apart and the core members and a few other characters leave to follow Sephiroth , while Shinra searches for `` the Promised Land , '' a land with tons of Mako energy . The story is serious . A main character even dies at the climax of the first disc . It leads you through tons of places and aquaints you with many people . Of course the ever popular Biggs and Wedge return , as does Cid ( you may not get this if you are n't big for Final Fantasy games ) . The Limit Breaks are cool . During battle there is a gauge called Limit Break which fills when you are attacked . When it fills all the way , you can use Limit Breaks which are very strong attacks . You learn new ones by using previous ones or a variety of other ways for certain characters . The status effects such as Poison or Mute are used . The ammount of Materia is staggering . The summons are great , but one stands out as fairly impossible to not be a one hit kill , besides on Safer Sephiroth if he has on Wall , or Emerald and Ruby Weapon regardless . This summon is common knowledge for Final Fantasy enthusiasts , Knights of the Round , where 13 knights attack the enemies . If you have a good magic stat , they do a good 9000 damage per attack ( 9000 x 13 = 117,000 damage ) . The graphics are standout awesome for their time , but nowadays they are n't special and the character designs are a disaster , but again , they were awesome back in the days . The sound is top notch with awesome music . Just like Xenogears , it 's one of those few games where I like the music . There are a few huge [ disappointments ] ( the chocobo battle music ) and a few instant favorites ( the Safer Sephiroth music , `` One Winged Angel '' ) . The game length is about 40-50 hours , but you 'll keep playing it to get to level 99 and complete every last side quest ( like me ! ) and clock in 70 hours if you have one ounce of common sense . The control is flawless except for the X for cancel and Circle for confirm , but that can be fixed with the customizable controls very easily . I just ca n't believe that you 're still reading this review ! Buy the game already , you wo n't regret it .	1
If you 're a fan , then there 's no need to read this any further . I wo n't say much , but this is truly one of the greatest RPG 's ever made .	1
FFVII is a role playing game where your decisions during the game will effect the overall outcome of the game . You are in control of a character named Cloud , an ex member of the famed Soldier from Shinra Inc . Cloud , along with a group of freedom fighters by the name of AVALANCHE , try to free the city of Midgar from the evil clutches of the president of Shinra Inc . Along the way Cloud befriends a young flower girl , a scientific experiment specimen , a fortune teller , an assasin , a ninja , and an ex pilot who help him in freeing Midgar . But there is an even deeper evil at work here as Cloud and his friends discover that the greatest Soldier in the world , Sephiroth , plans to destroy the entire world . Now with the help of his newfound comrades , Cloud must face his teenage past , and face his teenage idol in a climatic battle for the freedom of the world and the destruction of evil.Final Fantasy VII introduces a new time based system for battle sequences . Instead of taking turns hitting each other , the time based system makes it so that you have to wait a specific amount of time to attack again . The world map lets you travel anywhere and do almost anything . With stunning cinematography and dazzling graphics , Final Fantasy VII is truly the cream of the crop and the best role playing game this world has ever seen.Bottom Line : Arguably the best game for the Playstation console . Final Fantasy VII caps them all .	1
This is one of the best Final Fantasy games there is it re-wrote the video gaming at the time and introduced a new system of magic and weapons to the FF series . It is a lot of fun to play and I would buy it again if my copy ever got damaged .	1
Final Fantasy VII has the absolute BEST storyline in an RPG . Period . I know very few ( if any ) people who have started and not finished this game with a smile . It 's extremely addictive and you wo n't get bored with it before you finish it . I just love this game so much !	1
I just finished writing a review of the excellent soundtrack to this game and realised I had n't even written a review for the game , so here goes . In my opinion this is the greatest video game of any genre , of all time . The Final Fantasy series in general is probably my favourite series of games ( awaiting XII eagerly ) , and VII is the best of all.What makes it the best ? It has to be the plot , which by gaming standards is superb , the angst driven main character is overdone in RPG 's but it works to good effect here . Sephiroth is another reason , he is the best bad-guy in a game ever , he is just pure evil . He causes the plot to be more unpredictable than your average RPG , who honestly expected him to kill Aeris , when they first played through ? Main characters rarely die in these sort of games . It is just a joy to play in every sense , the mini games compliment it well , including in the Gold Saucer . The soundtrack is great , of course the graphics are now dated , but it does n't detract from the gameplay at all , a true masterpiece , if you do n't own it already , you could n't do any better than to buy it now !	1
I had never played this game until this year ; I wanted to see if this game lived up to its name.My previous experience with this series includes X , XI , and a touch of XIII ; I have to say that while I enjoy parts of X , on the whole I hate these games . Most of this hatred stems from having more hours of cut scenes than hours of actual gameplay . I also like RPG 's to have a roaming element ; I like being able to explore and I like finding sidequests and items . I did not get that with these titles . I expected FFVII to be the same and just riding its reputation.Bad news first . This is a PlayStation 1 game , and oh my does it look it . This is an ugly game . Battles are n't bad and cut scenes could be worse , but walking around is bad . When exploring an area , it 's often difficult to identify exits , ramps and ladders , and various & # 34 ; switches. & # 34 ; There 's a command that highlights ladders and exits to other areas , but ramps and switches are still hidden . This option has saved me some headaches , but it 's aesthetically displeasing . RPG 's had n't started the & # 34 ; journal & # 34 ; thing yet , so skipping dialogue ( even accidentally ) or coming back to game after a busy week can lead to some confusion . I 'm not crazy about the combat system . Combat is n't intuitive and that there are far too many status effects.Good news . The characters are varied and this together with the materia system allows for a wonderful amount of customization and different play styles . The characters themselves , while definitely cliche , have decent back-stories and fairly strong characterization . I 've heard a lot of complaints about character angst in this game , but I think those complaints are exaggerations and what little angst is there matches the story and characters well . The plot itself is solid and has plenty of twists . The combat system works . I say it 's complicated and unintuitive , but it functions well and allows experimentation with different tactics . Most sidequests are fun , and while you do n't need the sidequest rewards to beat the game , those prizes are often very powerful . The cut scenes are well done , always convey something relevant , and never overstay their welcome.Summary : The graphics are bad and can get in the way of the game , but this is the only thing that does n't hold up well . It 's a long , fun game with plenty of replay value . The combat is complex , but it works well and that complexity allows the player to be creative and to try some very interesting things . This game certainly has its problems , but its quality is undeniable and it 's rapidly becoming my favorite game .	1
I have played thousands of games , spent countless hours on them . I have played the best with titles such as Grand Theft Auto Vice City , and I have played some of the worst like TOtal Recall . However throughout all the games that I have played only one stands out as the number one game of all time . That title is Final Fantasy 7.What makes Final Fantasy 7 so great , especially considering the past titles , the sequels , and other great titles such as Dragon Warrior Series , BReath of Fire , and so on . It has a special something that few games really have . Any game can draw you into a story , hell old NES titles such as Ninja Gaiden and Zelda could do that . However what makes this so great is that it is one of the select few titles in the relm of video gmaes that can do something that no other games can , but I shall reveal that later . LEts talk about the game.FInal Fantasy 7 starts off like an action movie might . You control Cloud Strife , an ex-soldier ( equivelent to the NAvy Seals ) who is now a mercenary for hire . He is currently working for the terrorist organization known as Avalanche ran by Barrett , a big burly black man with a chaingun for a hand . His second in command is a girl named Tifa who was a childhood friend of clouds . After a few succesful missions cloud is seperated from the team where he meets up with a young girl named Aeris . Little does cloud realize at first is that Aeris is beign pursued by the conglomerate Shinra ( Shinra is what Avalanche is trying to bring down. ) . CLoud decideds to help her out but when she is kidnapped he must rescue her . MEanwhile a ghost from the past returns to not only haunt him , but destroy the world.This is the main focus of the first few hours . The story itself will slowly evolve into something that if you show dedication to than you will be very satisfied when it is all said and done . Now lets talk about some technical aspects.The graphics for the time are outstanding , however when compared to today it is proof of how dated graphics can get quickly.COntrols are fluent enough and the menues are asy to scroll through.COmbat is never really one sided however if you do n't build up your levels ( by the end of Disk one should be level 40 or higher for the whole party ) you will be whipped.The music is what seperates this from most games . The music is the pinacle of greatness here . As I am writing this I am listening to Aeris Theme which is one of the greatest tracks in gaming history . This alone seperates this from most gaems past and present.However there is one factor that seperates this from most games . The secret to why this one of he best is that it is one of the few games that can touch you emotionally . Any game can give you an adrenaline rush . However it is very select few gaems that can touch you emotionally , and even make you cry . Final Fantasy 7 has accomplished this . THis is one of the select few titles that has ever done this . To date the only other title to do this is the cult hit Ico.In conclusion Final Fantasy 7 is the greatest game of all time because it has an incredible story , incredibel music , and the fact that you will be sucked in if you give it time . But that is the thing , you must give it time and dedication . This is however the greatest game of all time .	1
And I finally got my own copy a few days ago . The graphics for the characters are 'blocky ' , but I like them because they make me think of Legos and it amuses me . I think the quality of the graphics actually work better in certain scenes , like with Don Corneo . Better/updated graphics would ruin the whole 'corny ' angle . Though updated movie scenes would be nice . The playable characters are nicely varied , from all walks of life . Of course I hate the time-consuming leveling up part , as I do in all RPGs , though the Materia add-ons are the best ones I like of the Final Fantasy series so far ( played them all from the original up to XII , with the exception of V and IX ) . The story does take a while to get interesting , but that does n't bother me too much , with all the side quests available .	1
Being a diehard Final Fantasy fan , I just had to get this game . While I enjoyed it for the most part , I was disappointed by the & quot ; feel & quot ; of the game for lack of a better term . It was not fantasy , it was more science fiction , and I really could have done without the awkward-looking polygon characters . But the music is fantastic , the storyline is moderately interesting , and I think it just depends on what kind of gamer you are as to how much you like it . Most newer gamers really love it , so if you are hesitant rent before you buy . ( They finally listened to us old-school gamers and did us right with Final Fantasy IX , though ! Marvelous ! ! )	1
My 21 year old plays this so I do n't know anything to say except she loves it , as does my wife .	1
As the title says , this game is old , but it 's still epic . I 'm a HUGE fan of the FFVII saga and I 'm glad that I got this because I played the other one so much that I had to get another one . I must be getting rusty because the boss battles in here I 've had some trouble with . But , as always , I find a way to beat them all.If some are use to playing 3D games , then ... uhh ... dude , go back to 2D if you 're a true gamer . Even after 10 years , the grafics are good , the fighting is awesome , and the story is always as epic as ever knowing that it 's from Square Enix . Ha , I just feel old playing this and I 'm not even 20 yet ! But it 's a really good game and you should play it for sure .	1
I like how 90 % of people either rate this game absolutely perfect or a complete waste of time with almost no 2-4 star ratings . Complete fanboyism or complete anti-fanboy , fanboyism . Let it be known that I did not grow up with this game so I do n't have the nostalgia glasses on when reviewing this game . So , let me grab my anti-flame shield to avoid being destroyed by 30-something-year old , butthurt fanboys for giving this game a star less from absolute perfection.1 . Gameplay/Battle System - The controls are intuitive and easy to understand . Nothing complicated there . The game 's challenge comes in the ATB where characters have to actively wait before acting on your commands . It creates a tension in battle because you have to quickly decide what to do before time is up and you ca n't afford those precious seconds wasted , especially during boss battles . The game is neither too hard nor too easy . Power leveling is n't required for normal battles . Grinding a level or two is required for some bosses , especially the secret ones . Ohter than that the game does a good job with difficulty . The materia system takes some getting used to however . That is the complicated part to really grasp and use intelligently . Some characters , like Tifa would n't be a good healer , so white magic materia is useless to her . You have to take each characters stats into play when equipping them with materia on their weapons . I like the strategy system in play , though some felt it to be somewhat overly complicated.Plotline/Characters - Many people consider this the best part of the game . I think it 's a very intelligent story , even by today 's standard . In fact , it 's better than about 90 % of video game plotlines . No exaggeration and I played this game in 2010 . It really does get you caring about the characters . One thing I did n't like however , and this is kinda big , is the main protaganist Cloud Strife . He 's just plain unlikeable and has n't the slightest inkling of a distinct personality , BUT the storyline justifies him being the way he is and I understand his appeal to young people , but I just plain do n't like him . He has basically no personality . Everyone else , especially Tifa are very likeable and you find yourself involved with their personal place in the overarching plot.Graphics - First rpg with 3D rendering that complimented the gameplay and story . PSOne graphics aside , they are groundbreaking like everything else.Overall , this is a fantastic game . A few unanswered story elements and an emotionally dead protaganist are my only real gripes.If you have a ps2 , buy this game . Do it . Forget the hype , haters and fanboyism and enjoy this marvelous experience . Cheers and happy gaming !	1
EA need to re-make this exciting game for ps3 or ps4 no doubt about it . they need to have hardcore NFS gamers back bring back what made NFS need for speed . not auto-log or alldrive crap 2 player racer with criterions Hotpursuit graphic is all we need .	1
it was a great game of the time and lots of fun though an arcade game the graphics r good for the time period it was made but dosnt compare to most other raceing games now	1
the graphics used to look great but now I 've played PS2 and I think they look kind of bad but this is one of the best playstation games out there use the code to get the ford indigo its the best car	1
This is a great game . Lots of fun ! If you are a game collector I would suggest you grab this game ; )	1
OH , Dreamcast , How do I love the ? Let me count the ways : Power Stone , Sonic Adventure ( 1 not two ) Bangai-O , Dead or Alive 2 ...	1
You ca n't go wrong with this game . The character schemes , the fighting mechanics , the play-style , the music , the stages ; they are all extraordinary . You 're gon na like this game for sure , I guarantee it .	1
I love this innovative game . The combat system is so fun . Picking up objects and throwing them at your oponents will give you significant advantage over them . The transformation after you collect all three power stones is so cool ! I like the fact that everyone gets a chance to evolve and to become the strongest fighter .	1
Power Stone is one of the great gems on the Dreamcast . This game was a breakthrough among fighting/action games . It is a 3D versus fighter , with tons of special moves , destructable environments , weapons and other items you can pick up and use , environmental traps and gadgets that can help or hinder you , and environmental objects you can use to jump off of , climb on , tear down , etc . It is a combination `` capture the flag '' /fighter where everyone goes dashing around for powerups and attacks each other to get them to drop their power stones . Once someone collects all the power stones , they go into their super mode and it becomes a game of cat and mouse until the effects wear off and the power stones fly off in random directions . This game is totally fun , totally original , and totally worth buying a Dreamcast if only to play this one game .	1
Do you like fighting games but wish they had a little more depth ? Well then Power Stone might be for you . It 's a great game where the 3D arenas , fast speed , crazy weapons and powerup moves really get your heart pumping . Everything here can be used to your advantage , from street polls to swing on to boxes & amp ; cafe chairs to throw . The different environments really give you something to look at and each player has their own unique power moves . Unlike other games , this game makes you look for Power Stones , which transform you into a person with enhanced powers . Then they can really do some damage . Just getting to the stones first will be hard enough , along with defeating your foe . It 's a cool game and I highly reccomend it .	1
Good , the price should have been cheaper for how old this game is . Game was just the way I played it years ago !	1
Capcom continues to make great fighting games , but this time out with Power Stone they create something special . Power Stone was one of the first Dreamcast games out for the Dreamcast and helped make the system worth buying . You can go anywhere , grab anything , and then beat the hell out of your opponent . Its a great game , the only problem is that there is so much going on during the game you can lose your concentration at times , but thats the only flaw . Otherwise , its a great game .	1
Power Stone is a fun filled action game that every one will like.It has fast action ! Fast pace baby ! The way I like it.The desighn is great . The level desighn in Power stone is awesome.Gameplay is great ! Thats what it 's all about . Gameplay . It 's also easy to use and learn . The game will last for awhile but You will eventually get bored with it . But not for awhile.This game is great ... I give it 5/5 ... .It 's really good trust me.I have n't played Power Stone 2 though . But get this game ... ..Later ...	1
This is one of the best fighting games that i have ever played ( other than killer instinct ) , and i have to congratulate sega on it . The graphics are amazing there are plenty of characters to choose from , the levels are all varied and the two player mode has kept my friends and I busy for months .	1
There are so many reviews of this top game around , that I will keep to the vital points . Is this the best Resident Evil game yet ? Yes , It looks absolutely fantastic , but due to familiarity , it 's not as scary any more , unless you have no idea what to expect . The zombies do n't even fall to pieces in chunks any more ! WHY ? ? ? Is it in complete 3D ? NO ! This was hyped up pre-release , but the truth is that , although the camera follows the characters around a little , all scenes are viewed from selected , semi-fixed view points , and you can not look around at will . Shame ! If you make it through to the Bonus game , you can play in first person , and really see the amount of detail present in those scenes . I actually like the fixed perspective of these games , as it looks so cinematic , but imagine the whole game with this freedom ... Is it value for money ? Yes ! This is a long game that rewards some serious time investment . There are many , many locations and places to explore However , although it is a very long game , it 's not that difficult ! Claire has to battle the Tyrant in the back of a plane halfway through , and this is the only really tough challenge , the rest of the encounters are a bit on the easy side . You should not die much if you are a seasoned player . But the positive details override these small let-downs . Everything looks real ! Locations and characters are perfectly realised , and Claire 's lighter provides a really beautiful effect . The sounds and music are also excellent , you get to play as three people , and what a story ... Dreamcast owners can really boast about this addition to SEGA 's line up , and it has to be one of the must-haves of the system .	1
Resident Evil : Code Veronica.This was originally released on the Dreamcast and originally intended to be the third of the Resident Evil series . However , that went to what we now know as the excellent Nemesis game for playstation.This game was the first to be set in full 3D with no pre-rendered backgrounds . This game has held up very well and the graphics are more polished on the PS2 and gamecube versions.It follows the story of Claire Redfield after the events of Resident Evil 2 and also reintroduces us to one of the heroes from the original game , Chris Redfield . It features new enemies , weapons and entirely new locations.Something about the location did n't set right with me . Oh , I know ... it 's not Raccoon City . Well , I guess they could n't help that after Nemesis , but still.I say this is where Resident Evil started to go down hill . That does n't mean this is a bad game , but this does n't feel as fresh as the others before it , who still play great in 2009 . I 'd recommend this as it is better than Resident Evil Zero , 4 and much better than 5 .	1
The Resident Evil games have long been a Playstation staple , having had three wildly successful games in the series . Well move over Playstation , because the franchise is moving to Dreamcast and going hi-res ! Resident Evil : Code Veronica takes place between Resident Evil 2 and 3 , and once again features Claire Redfield and her brother Chris . This time Claire is being held prisoner on an Umbrella-owned , zombie infested island far away from Racoon City . On her desperate attempt to escape the island , Claire meets several characters - some helpful , but most not so helpful.Code Veronica plays exactly like the other Resident Evil games ( I 've got them all ) , so if you like that style of control , you 're in business here . What really sets Code Veronica apart from it 's siblings , however are the graphics . I think I can confidently say that this is the best looking zombie game ever made . You can see every pus-oozing sore on those pathetic zombies , and environments are fully rendered in 3D.This game is a slam-dunk if you like the survival horror genre .	1
This is the Resident Evil game that all people have been waiting for , even if they do n't realize it yet . It was so good that it refused to die with the failing Dreamcast and dove across to the Play Station 2 ( I hear the graphics are n't as good on PS2 ) . It is the ultimate survival horror game.What make Veronica so great ? The graphics are no small part . Sure , I reveled like the rest of us in the exploding zombie heads of RE 2 and 3 but I loved the brain splatter of Veronica . The Tyrant from RE 2 , with his blank stare and overcoat never conveyed the sheer life of a bendersnatch as he trapezed across the room and crushed your head , all the while looking at you with those oh so human eyes.What else you ask , makes this game THE RE ? Well , the story is superbly done and Alexia is the most ... AWESOME bad guy ( errr ... Girl ) that has ever graced the screen . And all your old favorites are back too so expect to see some old friends and new enemies as you crawl and run around.Oh and there is more ! Guns have always been great in the Resident Evil games but these guns are crisp . By that I mean they may not be awe-imspiring like the electroshocker from 2 or as satisfying as the enhanced shotgun rounds from 3 but they will do the job exactly like you would expect . The twin uzi 's will stop a zombie in its tracks but the spiders will laugh as they pump poison into you . But you can show them who is boss with a blast from the grenade launcher , now better built to kill groups . Across the board the guns will satisfy.And there is just so much else that I can not write it all . But needless to say , if you own a DC or PS2 this is a good purchase at any price . Get it , buy it , steal it , love it . Come be a zombie killer with the rest of us .	1
I played RE2 and loved it but Code Veronica for Dreamcast was everything that was great about the series and completely perfected it.Perfect atmosphere.Scary music.Spot on controls.Devious puzzles.And of course ... ... .zombies , zombies and MORE ZOMBIES.Gorgeous graphics , stunning for its time.A story line that advanced the whole series quite a bit.I really have nothing bad to say about the game.The only thing I did n't like then is the same thing I do n't like now ... ..the crate pushing.Why is there crate pushing in every RE game ? How often do you need to push crates in real life to get from one area to another ? It 's not like I walk down the street during lunch break and encounter random crates on the sidewalk.It might be kind of cool if I did though.Granted , I do n't run into zombies either ... ... ..hmmmm ... ... ..do the working people downtown count ? I 'll have to say yes to that one.Never mind ... ... .RE Code Veronica.Took the formula of the original RE and perfected it.A must play for survival horror fans.Recommended .	1
Thanks again i didnt know if the other feedback went through or not but i wanted to make sure you got a good review and thanks for the valentines day wrapping sweet as ever .	1
Is n't it time they brought Claire back ? And not in no & # 34 ; Operation Raccoon City & # 34 ; neither . Five , four , three , two , one .	1
Every part of this game has been permanently burned into the recesses of my brain . Maybe not the specifics of plot or location , only the fear , that sheer terror I had from beginning to end . This is what video games are all about - the ability to step inside a movie or novel and live those incredible moments as if they were your own . I forgot I was sitting safely in my house , my life was on that screen.If that does n't tell you this game is good , I do n't know what to write . The plot is unbelievable , the graphics are unbelievable , the game is unbelievable , the only problem I have is that you are n't really motivated to play it again after you finish it , but the game is really long , so I 'm not too disappointed . I 've had a PS2 since Xmas , and I still have n't seen graphics to beat this game . The story rivals my favorite movies , and I HATE video game plots !	1
Graphics wise this game is awesome . The control is easy to get used to and it is fun.The problems with this game begin early on . The main problem is the puzzles and bosses . There are many times when you will get stuck because you did n't move some block 8 hours ago , of course you ca n't go back so your only alternative is to start over . Very frustrating.Graphics : 9/10Sound : 7/10Fun : 7/10Control : 8/10	1
I have to admit that I had never been much of a fan of the Resident Evil series on Play Station . But then Code Veronica came out on Dreamcast , and I quickly became a convert to the school of & quot ; survival horror & quot ; after watching my brother lay waste to a few zombies . This game will have you on edge -- the story is suspenseful , and the enemies who pop out from behind corners can even make your heart jump if you try playing at night with the lights off . This is an A+ title that belongs in every gamer 's collection . Even if you did n't like the other games in the Resident Evil series , Code Veronica will thrill you !	1
The latest inclusion in the Resident Evil series is quite simply the best thus far , with some fantastic if obvious plot twists it leaps ahead in the survival horror genre.Im sure you all know the story by no so I ? ll comment on the graphics which are still awesome , This is without a doubt the best game on Dreamcast even a year after it ? s release it still crushes most other games . The gameplay is only slightly improved from the originals but hell , ? If It Ain ? t Broke , Why Fix It ? , The game is well structured with a variety of puzzles , suspense and plenty of action.Unlike the rest of the games in the series , if you didn ? t like the others this game ? Will ? change your mind , fans of any genre with love and respect this game for years to come and justifiably so . The voice acting is spot on and the characters facial details when they talk is phenomenal , to the extent that it ( at times ) surpasses the almighty Shenmue . In conclusion this is one game that defiantly does the Dreamcast justice .	1
Follow Claire Redfield of Resident Evil 2 as she searches for her lost brother Chris , only to uncover another sinister plot to unleash a horrible curse on the world in the name of love . Rescue your brother only to be rescued by him . & # 34 ; Code Veronica & # 34 ; made for an awesome pre-Halloween gaming experience , kicking back in a bean bag chair with a bag of candy corn and the lights turned down low . & # 34 ; Code Veronica & # 34 ; is the true third installment in the franchise , but given Capcom 's contract with SONY to produce a main-series title on their PlayStation system , their & # 34 ; Nemesis & # 34 ; spin-off took this game 's place , and regrettably . & # 34 ; Veronica & # 34 ; is certainly a better game , with a better plot , better graphics , and better gameplay . Additionally , & # 34 ; Veronica & # 34 ; marks the series ' last game in the Survival Horror genre before & # 34 ; Resident Evil 4 & # 34 ; branched the series into an on-rails pseudo-shooter action-adventure nightmare ( no pun intended ; this analysis is accurately and justifiably harsh ) . It is the only game for the DreamCast , all in all , worth playing . It makes little use of the hardware 's potential , and is only enjoyable insofar as it is a Resident Evil game .	1
Resident Evil : Code Veronica . If I could only say four words about this game , what would it be ? BUY IT RIGHT NOW ! If you liked the classy feel and mood of the Pre-RE4 games , with the shuffling zombies , limited health , and your nervous system going haywire because so many signs in the game scream 'DANGER ' , then this is definitely a game for you ! However , just let you know , this game does still have the 'clunky ' 'tank controls ' associated with RE games . However , due to the Dreamcast 's analog stick , it will be slightly easier to master the steering of this game then , for instance , the Gamecube REmake.Story : Roughly Three Months after Claire Redfield , Leon S. Kennedy , and Sherry Birkin escaped Raccoon City , Claire has found her way to Paris , France , the main headquarters of Umbrella Europe Inc. She infiltrates , but after a stunning cinema that impress even to this day , she goes down fighting HARD ! Roughly 10 days later , WKD4496 , aka Claire Redfield , is transported to Rockford Island , a prison facility and military training ground . While there , a bombing raid occurs , releasing the T-Virus onto the island . Claire 's wounded prison guard releases her , but warns that there is 'No way off this island'.However , RE 's favorite rebel biker sets out to prove him wrong , fighting hordes of the undead , along with freak mutations , while meeting some enemy faces like the Ashfords , and some slightly-irritating ones , like Steve Burnside . While there , she stumbles upon secrets about the island 's owners , the Ashfords , and dark secrets on the history of Umbrella , taking her as far south as one could imagine , and even towing her lost brother Chris into the mix.Why would I recommend this game ? : The challenge . This game is very good at starving you of health . Probably the second half of the first disc I was wandering about in danger , hoping to find at least a green herb while trying to keep the undead and mutants away from me.However , like RE3 , it makes up the lack of health with a crap load of ammunition . If you play your cards right , nearly half of your inventory at the end of the game , before the final boss , will be back with guns and ammunition . Your classic RE weapons are here , Shotgun , Handgun , Grenade Launcher , etc , but so many new types are added it 's not funny ! Also , the Knife and Bow Gun in this game , they are OVERPOWERED ! Four slashes can kill your average Zombie . About 12 Bow gun arrows will take a Zombie down , as opposed to the 20+ slashes and arrows in RE2 . Not to mention that if you combine Regular Bow Gun Arrows with explosive powder , you have the most powerful weapon in the game . However , there are not many of these in the game.The story is very clean as it progresses , taking numerous twists and turns throughout , but still being easy to follow.The characters are hit-and-miss for most . Chris and Claire are spot on , along with a familiar face from a previous game . Steve can get a bit annoying , but by the time you get to the second disc , he 'll either have grown on you , or you 'll loathe his guts . The Ashfords , while annoying , have their parts done perfectly.After completing the game . *Which , first time around , will probably take about 10-12 hours* , you unlock a Battle Mode Reminiscent of the Saturn port of RE1 . It 's entertaining , although limited.Just to note : Maybe except RE0 *I 've not played that game yet* , this game has fewer unlockables then most other RE games . You only get the Battle Mode , a special weapon for battle mode after A-ranking that , and a special weapon for normal mode if you can complete the game under 4 hours with NO deaths , NO First-Aid Sprays , NO saves *Except for the one they prompt you with between discs* , and NO continues . While the first half of the game could easily be done that way , the second half is near impossible with the *shudders* Hunters and Claire 's final puzzle in the last part of the last disc . There are no 'bonus costumes ' , save for Claire 's alternate in the Battle Mode , no other extra weapons , etc . Compare that to RE2 , with alternate costumes , extra weapons galore , EXT battle mode , and Hunk/Tofu story.Just to let you know , this game can be purchased for the PS2 and GC , with some added cutscenes in those versions . However , for me , having the original Dreamcast feel is where it 's at . If you own a Dreamcast , or any console that carries this game , go for it !	1
This is the best in the RE series yet . It looks wonderful on Dreamcast . Clear and fluid graphics with solid gameplay . The ability to use 2 weapons in 2 different directions is a new feature that has really added to gameplay and gives the player an opportunity to make it safely through tight situations . It is a must buy , if you have a new Dreamcast make this one of your first games !	1
I 've been playing RE since it first came out for PS and back then it scared the living daylights out of me . Nowadays , it still is . This game is just too good to pass up . I highly recommend everyone to buy this game if you are even just a slight fan of the series . I hate myself for waiting this long to buy it . By the way , when you first see those Arm Stretchers , prepare to have an extra pair of BVD 's on hand . Yikes !	1
This didnt have the best plot as the other res do , but was a hell of alot challanging . Your Claire Redfield looking for your brother Chris Redfield . You meet Steve Burnquist who eventually dies im sorry to say . I dont wan na spoil any more but anyway , Your main goal is to survive on the umbrella base owned by Miss Veronica . She is the master of all the ashfords which are a family of very wealthy people . Youll meet Alexia and Alfred . They are deadly so becareful . The graphics are the best part . Youll see a world of reality when you first see the first fmv . The Plot is good but not the best . And the handgun you get as your first weapon , lol sux . But you will not be dissapointed when you first turn the game on . You also will play as Chris Later in the game so have fun while the game lasts .	1
OK , I 'll admit , when I first saw that Sega was going to take over the production part of the game , I hesistated . Being a fan of the Resident Evil series , I thought that it should 've stayed with Sony . All of the games on Sony ( except for the ... Survivor shooting game ) were awesome , bringing me to new levels of terror and fear . Code Veronica , however , surpasses them all to the point where you will have nightmares.The story takes place a bit after Res 2 ( which happened before and during Res 3 , if you can keep up ) . Claire Redfield , while looking for her brother Chris , has been captured by Umbrella and detained on an uncharted island . Of course , zombies come out from nowhere , and Claire has to find a way to get off the island . The plot is top notch , and some parts had me going , `` What the heck ? `` , while the creatures had me saying other words I should n't say . The game is engrossing , and with the addition of a dark room and surround sound , it 's really creepy . Creaking sounds and footsteps will have you wondering what 's behind door # 1 ( giant spiders make quick thump-thump-thump sounds with their legs before they come to chew on you ) , and the beasts are rendered nicely ( in a scare-you-silly kind of way ) . The puzzles will make you think , as checking everything you collect is the only way to get through.The graphics are excellent , as shading and cutscenes are beautiful to watch . When Claire lights her lighter , it 's a sight to behold , as it flickers realistically . The only problem is the clunky control , as it seems to populate this series a lot . It 's a problem , but one you can adapt to ( and you 'd better , before you become lunch meat ) .The replay value comes in the battle game . Beat the game , and that becomes available ( successfully complete a puzzle in the game , and Steve becomes available ) . You can play as Claire , Chris Redfield , Steve , or Wesker , each complete with certain weapons ( Wesker 's game is insane ; you only fight with a knife ) .All in all , with the Dreamcast becoming more affordable , I 'd suggest you pick this game up . It 's easily the best of the series .	1
Simply put , Code Veronica is the best in the series . After RE2 I did n't think the series could get any better but I was wrong . CV had an amazing graphics and a superb camera system . The story was HUGE and awesome so this was the most time consuming RE at the time . I think the remake of RE on the Gamecube is longer ( and 10 times scarier than the PSX version ) . If you have a Gamecube or DC and love adventure/action/horror games than Code Veronica and the rest of the series is definately for you .	1
Without a doubt the best Resident Evil game ever made , & quot ; Code : Veronica & quot ; will amaze you with it 's beauty , and scare the hell out of you with it 's zombie shooting action . The graphics are super superb , looking almost movie like and giving you such a surreal feeling its like your interacting with a movie rather than playing a game . And like true horror should be , there 's plenty of thrills , chills , and a hell of a lot of spills to behold . Never has being scared senseless been so fun . Essential for the Dreamcast owner .	1
Resident Evil : Code Veronica on the Dreamcast has the same mutant/zombie killing and gore everyone would expect from a Resident Evil game . The graphics are considerably better in this latest installment of the series , and there are plently of new monsters to exterminate . As for the weapons , there is n't much new here ... but at least it 's kept relatively realistic with shotguns , pistols , and sub-machine guns , ect . The story is involved and although at some points predictable , it 's executed well from start to finish . Unfortunately , as in the other Resident Evil games , there is a lot of back tracking that must be done to complete the game ... and having limited item space makes it all the more time consuming . If you 've played the previous Resident Evil games , you know what to expect . There 's also plently of fun secrets to unlock ( like Battle Mode ) , and they add a considerable amount of replay value . Resident Evil : Code Veronica is yet another great reason to own a Dreamcast .	1
This is the ultimate Resident Evil . It has way better graphics , better sound , a better story ... Everything is better , but it does feel just like the old Resident Evil game , it has the same feel to it . If you do n't have this do n't consider yourself a fan of the series .	1
This is truly the best Resident Evil made so far ! When i first turned it on and watched the first opening movie i was amazed ! The graphics are great ! So after that i got the first moment of gameplay . Same controls . Im used to em but they were a little difficult to master when i played the first resident evil.I go up the stairs what are there ? Zombies ! Different zombies actually . There graveyard zombies ! I have a knife and try and kill em . I somehow do it . Im thinking ugh this game is gon na be hard ! What do i do ? Keep playing and run oit of ammo fast and die ! If you really want to be able to beat this game you need to buy some kind of strategy guide or something . So why are you reading this ? Go buy the game ! Its the best so far !	1
This Resident Evil is the best out of the lot . The graphics on this are the best that i have seen of any Resident Evil game , and the puzzles have been taken afurther which i am glad about as in all of the other Rsident Evils all of the puzzles were similar . The game is longer than all of the other Resident Evils , and in like some of the previous games you get to take on the roles of other characters . The zombies are more intelligent and there seems to be a better feel to this game than all the others . Congratulations to Sega for producing the best game out of the series	1
[ Baio Hazard ] series have the most popularity in Japan . Especially Code Veronica is one of the most favorite thing . Because it game is very real gurafic game used the spec of Dream Cast ability very well . Even if it is now time that there are more great spec hard , PS2 , XBOX etc , you can play the came with the joy and the satisfication.Vaio series is , if I say to that simply , a active horror and action game . The main character of the game collect many weapons and curing items etc , you defeat the monsters that get to be stronger and storonger as story advance . The weapon is real too . For instance , the sound of the bullets , gravity feeling when the character have his gums at the ready ... When you use your bullets , there is fun that you consider the remaining bullets . And the sound is the horror sound . The monster are horror too.Thank you for reading poor writing .	1
When I bought code : veronica i was an amateur with resident evil game , but after playing two discs of resident evil pleasure , i can beat any resident evil game . Gaming is my profession , so the game wasnt too hard to beat for me , but it would be , on a scale of 1-10 , the hardness is an 8 , for average gamer , so be resident evil experienced befor you buy this great game , but other than that , the game is excellent , so the $ $ doesnt matter , the game play is worth it !	1
I did n't expect this game to be so fun . I just picked it up , just expecting to shoot things . I could n't of been anymore wrong . This game is the best game out for the Dreamcast . No question in my mind . First off , you just do n't shoot thing . There is actually a real plot to this game . Which sometimes lacks in others in this genre . There are puzzles to solve , so you actually have to think to play . But the best feature in this game is the mood . It 's just so morbid , you feel like your in the game . No joke . If I see a zombie , I start to wig-out . It draws you in . I really ca n't describe it . The only way you 'll know what I 'm talking about is to play the game . It 's the greatest .	1
Resident Evil Code : Veronica was the best selling game on the Dreamcast . Luckily for the PS2 owners Capcom has ported a version for their system . But it all started on Sega 's system . C : V was the first game in the series to feature highly detailed polygon backgrounds , tapping into the power of the DC . This coupled with some of the deepest most challenging , frightening gameplay in the entire series , and you have a game that is a must-have for both Dreamcast collectors or those who need absolutely every RE game ever made .	1
Like I said , I 've played a lot of Street Fighter games in several arcades and I 'm truly amazed with each and every one of them ( except for some of the Street Fighter EX series ) . Street Fighter Alpha 1 and 2 were excellent games and they sold well in the console market . Street Fighter Alpha 3 improved over all of the Street Fighter games when it first came to the Arcade and PlayStation . When the Dreamcast came out , I had second thoughts about the PlayStation version . I have no problem with the PlayStation version , but the only thing I hated about it was the loading times . On the superior Dreamcast version , there are absolutely no loading times in this one . The graphics moved at a solid framerate , the gameplay still remained solid , and for the first time ever , you can duke it out with people from around the world using online play ! This is the first Street Fighter game to ever achieve and online play feature . Remember that sorry excuse for a Street Fighter , Dan Hibiki ? Well his Shinku Gadouken can go faster and farther ( but stops at a certain point ) and now it looks bigger than before ! You get to play as several characters like Evil Ryu , Fei Long ( the Bruce Lee look-alike ) , T. Hawk , E. Honda , Ken , Chun Li , Ryu , Charlie , Blanka , Rainbow Mika , Gen , and more ! Wan na add a Street Fighter game in your Dreamcast library ? Get this one !	1
If you 're reading this , then this game may not be for you . I say that because the type of person who 'd enjoy this game most likely already owns it . If , however , you 're looking to see what the Dreamcast version has to offer , or you 're trying to break into the genre , read on.First and foremost , fans of strictly 3D fighters ( a la Tekken , Soul Calibur , or Dead or Alive ) need not apply . This game is 2D only , and if you 've grown accustomed to the slower pacing of most 3D fighters , the transition can be a bit of a shock . You should know what it is , exactly , that you 're buying before you order . Also , this game is n't the best looking 2D fighter you can buy . While it certaintly looks nice , it does n't look really any better than the arcade version as far as character animation and such goes.So why the 5 star rating ? Simple . The gameplay . This game has it in droves , and this is n't the instant pick-it-up-and-master-it-in-10-minutes kind of gameplay . The multiple single player missions , character saves , three different `` isms '' , and the overall deep build of the game make it seem more like an extremely high speed game of chess than a $ 20 fighter . A good player can soundly trounce those with less experience , and it 's very rare that a new player can sometimes one-up a veteran through luck and button mashing . Tekken has this problem , though some do n't consider it a problem . I , however , prefer a system that rewards those with the patience to master it . To each his own.This game can , and will , teach you if you 're willing to learn , however . A very good single player element lets you build up your characters in a quasi-RPGish manner . The better you fight , the more points you have to spend on making your character more powerful . You newly beefed character can either be left to complete the single player missions on his own ( which are very creative and fun with set objectives like `` beat 5 characters at once '' or `` use only super moves '' ) or can be exported to the arcade or vs. modes . For added fun , find a friend with a character he 's made , and pit your two characters against each other . Or , just play it in regular old arcade mode , which is perfectly translated and looks just perfect on the Dreamcast . If you thought the PSX version looked nice , wait till you see this . It wo n't turn any heads who are used to 3D , but as far as 2D goes , it looks mighty good considering the age of the game.All in all , an excellent choice if you consider yourself old-school fighting gamer and have the patience to learn . For those who prefer quick , painless , flashy , and shallow , look elsewhere.For those in the know , this is Capcom in top form .	1
I have been playing fighting games all my life mostly Mortal Kombat , Street Fighter , Virtua Fighter , and Tekken games.I recently bought this game on Amazon , and it 's so much fun in dramatic battle 2p co-op against the computer . This game is such an awesome game and has so many different fighting modes to choose from.I like the World Tour Mode , you build up up your character every time you beat an opponent.This game is like the Playstation game except the graphics and sound are way better , also their is little or no loading.This version is just like the arcade version except their is more modes and more replay value.Their is so many characters , but some are almost the same like Juli and Cammy they have almost the same moves.The fighting is almost the same as Street Fighter 2 , but it has fighting styles like A-isms , V-isms , and X-isms they are just different ways to do super moves.My favorite fighter is Shin Akuma.I played Street Fighter 3rd strike and I prefer this game over it because this one has more modes and extra characters.This game plays just like Super Street Fighter 2 turbo which is another classic game.This game is recommend if you like the Street Fighter or just like 2d fighting games.This game is really fun when you play it on a X-Arcade joystick or Hori arcade stick with a PS adapter to get the arcade experience.Pros : great selection of fighters , tons of modes , fun 2p co-op mode , fun game for playing with your friends , arcade perfectCons : too many similar characters , not everyone likes 2d games	1
I bought this because i had recently aquired a dreamcast and i wanted to collect games for it . I bought it because it was fairly priced but when I received it in the mail ; to my surprise , it was in perfect condition . It felt like the original owner took care of his stuff as the package it self was carefully made .	1
If you thought Street Fighter Alpha 3 was great in the arcade , you ai n't seen nothin yet . The graphics are crisp , clean , and very colorful , and the best part is there is virtually no loading time whatsoever . The World Tour mode is great and the regular arcade mode is still as fun as its always been , and at this price I 'd get it now if I were you 'cause it wo n't be around for much longer .	1
Street Fighter Alpha 3 is what the dreamcast needs at the moment , ands thats an excellent fighting game that is familiar with everone . All of your favourite characters are in the game ranging from Vega and Chunli to Deejay and Cammy . There are various modes of play and the two player option makes this game more appealing as you will have great fun repeatedly beating your friends	1
great , but you can get the entire Alpha collection for cheap on the PS2 nowadays ! still , a classic !	1
This is an amazing fighting game , you can pick from 15 characters which include ( IN ORDER ) Chun Li - Ryu - ZangiefMorrigan - Captain Commando - Mega ManStrider Hiryu - Spiderman - JinCaptain America - Venom - HulkGambit - War Machine - WolverineThe fighting is awsome when you connect on a hyper combo , you can go from 10 hits to 30 and beyond ! If you are very good you might be able to connect on a good aerial combo . Sure this ai n't no Marvel VS Capcom 2 but this is still a great game . The last boss is Onslaught which I find to be pretty hard and frustrating at times , the modes in this game are*Arcade*Versus*Survival*Training*Cross FeverIn this game Ryu can transform into either Ken or Akuma , pretty neat , and all with moves of their own ! Charecters with some of the stronget specials would be in my opinionZangief , War Machine , Ryu ( Akuma ) and Jin . But the best player to use for combos would have to be Strider , if you know how to use him he could possibly be the deadliest character in the game . Heres a little secret , once you have beaten the comp or your friend when right after it says KO and the stats appear press START and then you will be able to move around and attack your opponents dead body . But I seriously think you should see your doctor first before playing this because the flashes in this game are extreme , the specials make the screen flash in many different ways that can make one have a seizure or get dizzy . But this game is a milestone in fighting game history !	1
Pros : - Fast paced- Flashy super moves- 2 characters per team , 3rd characters acts as assist only- The team hyper moves are actually a bit better than in Marvel vs. Capcom 2 in my opinion.- Combo system allows for many consecutive hits- Colorful levels ; more comic book looking than Marvel vs. Capcom 2- 6 different characters to unlock- Great cast of characters- Will keep you entertained for hours , day , weeks , and possibly even months.- Two player mode will keep you entertained for years ! - The Dreamcast version of this game is much better than the PlayStation version . They removed tag team fighting from the PlayStation version due to its memory limitation . That takes a lot of fun out of the game.Cons : - If any , it would be for there to be more characters . Considering when it was released , it does have a very large character line-up .	1
I said it before and I 'll say it again in a different way . I 'm a 2D fighting veteran and I know which 2D fighter is worth playing all over again and which is worth ditching . However , the PlayStation version of Marvel VS Capcom is just one of those games that needs to be ditched , except for the Dreamcast conversion . Unlike its unworthy PlayStation apprentice , the Dreamcast version of Marvel VS Capcom is 100 % arcade perfect in every way ! Allow me to give the lowdown on this game ! The graphics are far by , the best I 've seen . Although they seem a bit dated to some people who never played or doubt the VS series , the animation is seamless , with no frames chopped off . The characters look brighter and they move much faster and smoother than that of the arcade version . Including the backgrounds which looks very colorful , but some of them looks like they 're featured in an enhanced 16-bit game . But despite of that , the Dreamcast 's power is capable of making 2D fighters look better than any other 2D fighters on different home consoles . The sound still remains the same as the arcade and PSX original . The music sounds fairly catchy , but could 've been better if Q-Sound had n't made the music too loud and too flashy to bother even the most patient person in the house . As for the sound effects , almost as similar to that of the earlier VS series , but much improved . You 'll still hear a whole lot of the same punching noises and the same hits taken from a super beam or a flame toasted fist . And for the voice acting , the same again , but the only voice that changed , was Ryu 's . His character sprite may be based on the original Street Fighter Alpha character , but Capcom designed him to give him his old red headband he had while he was growing older , and make his voice sound a little deeper . As for the gameplay , very well done . The PSX controls did n't do much of the justice but the design of the Dreamcast control fits the gameplay very well . With the DC controller , Marvel VS Capcom plays like a charm ! Yes my friends ... it 's that good ! And plus , you get the tag feature , where you can switch your characters anytime you want , especially when your first character is losing energy . And as for the game modes , you get five of them , which should be enough to please you . You still get the Arcade mode , along with the 2 player VS mode , Survival mode , Cross Fever mode , and Training mode . As for the selection of characters , it 's okay ... I guess . You get characters from the Marvel universe from the US and the Capcom universe from Japan . On the Capcom side we 've got Ryu , Chun-Li , Zangief , Mega Man , Strider Hiryu , Jin , Morrigan , Captain Commando , and Roll ( as a secret character ) . On the Marvel Comics side we 've got Wolverine , Spider-Man , Venom , Gambit , Hulk , and War Machine . The Marvel side does have its share of secret characters , but all of them are alternatives of the same character . But still , while the DC conversion has some flaws , it 's still arcade perfect and furthermore , it has no loading times . Marvel VS Capcom for the Dreamcast is one game that should n't be left behind . I know what you 're saying . I did n't really explain that much detail on the PlayStation version . But the reason why , is because its hard to explain complete details about a horrible port of a true Capcom classic . The DC version was simple to explain , because it defined arcade perfect with a vengeance ! Like I said , if you want the true Marvel VS Capcom experience , play the arcade version or just play this one ! You 'll be proud you did !	1
I absolutely had to have this game when it came out . It was such a great time when console games were finally living up to there arcade counterparts and even surpassing them in ways ( MvC2 had better graphics than the arcade ) . In Marvel vs. Capcom you select two fighters composed of either Marvel or Capcom characters ( or both ) . You can switch between them during the fight which had n't been done yet on home consoles due to RAM limitations . Such a great game and I 'm glad to have it in the collection because it 's as good as having the arcade machine itself .	1
You pick from 15 charactersRyu , Strider , Mega Man , Zangief , Morrigan , Captain Commando , Captain AmericaSpider Man , Venom , Jin , Hulk , Wolverine , Chun Li , Gambit , War MachineOnslaught is the boss in this gameAkuma , Ken and Onslaught are playable with a codeThis game is fun and has hyper fast gameplay.The game has 15 characters which is not that much , but it is made up in fast , nice gameplay.Some people whine about the graphics and say its `` bad '' and compare it to Tekken , those games are not in the same category.The 2d games are drawn and 3d games are polygon based graphics they are different types of things.The Dreamcast joystick is no longer made , but still want to play the game ? , I got a solution , get a Playstation 1/2 adapter and buy a ps2 or Psone joystick and then have fun just like the Arcade.I recommend this game to people who like the other cross over games like X-Men : Children of the Atom , Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter . This version is the best because its arcade perfect and its to pick up and play when you feel like fighting your heroes.Pros : Fast gameplay , Great graphics , awesome characters , fun to play , pull off huge combos , when using the arcade stick enhances gameplayCons : not enough characters , dreamcast controller not good for this game , 2d graphics not for everyone	1
This is a classic that took fighting games to a new level . Although i am a Mortal Kombat fan , i admit that this game is actually cool to a certain point . The second one is alot better and the third one is pretty sweet . However , you must remember the humble beginings of Super hero/ Street fighter games . I like it .	1
Until the Dreamcast came along no other system could handle the 2-D graphic processing power of a lot of 2-D games without a lot of loading . Marvel VS Capcom is better on the Dreamcast than it was in the arcades , the control is easy , the graphics are sharp and crisp and bright , and the action is fast , so fast you might lose track of what your doing . Though it was overshadowed by it 's superior sequel , Marvel VS Capcom is a must own Dreamcast title on its own . Also recommended is Marvel VS Capcom 2 , Power Stone 1 & 2 , Capcom VS SNK , Street Fighter Alpha 3 , Dead or Alive 2 , and Soul Calibur .	1
This game was good but not great . It was the very first MVC game and started the ball rolling . I had this game for the Dreamcast and played it the arcade for awhile . I thought it was pretty cool but just like XMen vs SF or Marvel vs SF. , but the difference was that people could call out special assists characters . I give credit though for starting the idea of having 3 on 3 matches in MVC2 .	1
There are secret ways to unlock alternate versions of some of the characters , and even unlock Onslaught . You 'll have to beat the game using certain techniques . In order to beat the game very easily , I personally found it best to use Ryu and Venom on Easy mode . Use them to beat the game multiple times and you 'll be able to unlock all of the secret characters.PROS:1 ) The vibration feedback is extremely sensitive ! ! ! You feel every bump and hit that you give your opponent.2 ) There is an Easy mode , which strangely is not in MvC part 2 . The Easy mode allows you to use Chun Li 's lighting fast kicks.3 ) There are a few super moves that are not in MvC part 2 . Like Chun Li 's has four supers in this game , while she has only three in part 2.CONS:1 ) There is a little slow-down with a few characters like War Machine and Strider . These characters move a lot faster in MvC part 2.2 ) You can not select the same person twice . In MvC part 2 , you are allowed to select the same person so you may have a team of three Akumas or whomever else.Overall , it 's a great game , and I urge you to buy it even if you already own MvC part 2 . I own both games and love them equally .	1
This is just as perfect as the arcade version . However , I did find that the music is a bit hyped up comparing to the arcade . Too bad there is n't really any new secrets in the game . The only thing I still do n't like is that out of all the versus series , Marvel vs Capcom has the worsest looking energy bars for your fighters . The dreamcast control pad is n't too great for this game either especially when you try to do striders 6 hit chain combo from jab-roundhouse . Still , just do n't let the controls bother you and if you are willing to spend $ 60 for the arcade stick then this game is definetly for you .	1
Intro : Ok , who would pass up an oppertunaty like this , unless of course you have the chance to buy the 2nd one , better , but yet not as valuable as the first , considering they DO N'T MAKE THE FIRST MARVEL VS. CAPCOM ANY MORE ! This game has crisp anamation , smooth gameplay , CRISTAL CLEAR sound and an awsome soundtrack that pumps you up and gets you in the mood for fighting ( In the game anyway ) . Do n't Pass up this golden oppertunity , get it if you can find it ! First one also available for the Sony Playstation , and 2nd one also for the Sega DreamCast and Sony Playstation 2 , and soon for Microsoft X-Box , and Nintendo Gamecube ! Characters : The list of characters consist of the following 25 : From The Capcom Universe : CHUN-LIRYU ( with Ken and Akuma Mode ) ZANGIEFMORRIGANCAPTAIN-COMMANDOMEGA-MANSTRIDERJIN.From The Marevel Universe : SPIDER-MANCAPTAIN AMERICAVENOMTHE INCREDIBLE HULKGAMBITWAR MACHINEWOLVERINE.Secret : From The Capcom Universe : LILITHSHADOW LADYROLLMECH ZANGIEFFrom The Marevel Universe : GOLD WAR MACHINEHYPER VENOMORANGE HULKONSLAUGHTSCORE : 4-5 ( The Character Roster could have included : Armored Spider-ManBlackheartCammyCyber AkumaCyclopsDanDark SakuraDhalsimJuggernautMagnetoM.BisonMephistoNashOmega RedRogueSabretoothSakuraShadowShuma GorathStormU.S.AgentOk , they did include a few of them , but only as helpers , if they made them as default playable characters , this game would have been way more awesome than it already is , and that would totaly rule ! ) Gameplay : The gameplay is based on how fast and fun the game has , and how much slowdown the game experiences during play.The gameplay is lighting fast with absolutly no slowdown when I play it unless it is so little and the game is so fast paced that it 's not noticeable , and that just makes the game even better . The game is also ultimate fun especially with playing with the younger kids , because the look on their face is priceless and hillarios when you pull off a huge combo with a great character , like Mega-Man for example.SCORE : 5-5SOUND : Sound score is based upon voice overs , SFX , and music.The music 1st of all is awesome , they use origonal music from origonal games , it starts off with the P1 's 1st Character music , like if P1 's 1st character is Mega-Man , then it starts off with Mega-Mans Music Used in the game , then after a character is killed the next character to pop up has his/her music played , like if Mega-Man is K.O.ed then the 2nd characters music for that team plays . The SFX rule , they are so good , thats all there is to say . The voice overs are perfect in every way and could n't be any more precice to the characters.SCORE : 5-5GRAPHICS : The graphics in this game are so beautiful and unbelievably awesome looking , that you ca n't even believe why they did n't do this in the earlier vs. games . If the graphics look this good on the 1st for Dreamcast then they have to look way better on the 2nd for the Dreamcast , and they do . I definetly have to give the graphics.SCORE : 5-5OVERALL : This is not an average , this is what I think about the whole game , as a ... whole game , anyway.SCORE : 5-5Get the game , unless you ca n't find it , then get the 2nd one !	1
Buy ! Best Graphics on the Dreamcast that I 've seen , and Fun gameplay to boot !	1
Old school , but great fighting .	1
You know , the only reason I wanted Dreamcast was for this game . I did n't care for other games except this game . THIS GAME rockS ! ! The graphics are the best I have every seen and there are like 100 moves for each charator . The great thing about this is that you can unlock charactors after you have beaten the game with other charators . THere is also mission mode where you go on & quot ; small mission & quot ; and then you can unlock stuff like stages and special features There is practice mode which I find very useful because I can practice my moves without getting disturbed or attacked by other players . My personal favorite is Maxi because I luv the Nunchaku and the moves look so good and his moves are easy and powerful . My least favorite charactor is Yoshimitsu because he is weak and does n't have very powerful attacks . I have the prima official strategy book and that tells be all the secrets about this awesome game . Let me tell you a little about the story line . THere was once a night of Cervantes and he had the soul Blade . He was a great Knight and ruled for many years until Taki and Sophita destroyed the ( all these charators you can play in the game ) . So One day , a young german knight named Siegfried came across Cervantes body . THe body burst into flames and Siegfried is now Nightmare . You are trying to get the soul edge and deafeat inferno.This game is very interesting because of its story and the way the charactors battle . There is going to be a SOul CAlibur 2 for Playstation 2 , Gamecube , and XBOX ! I ca n't wait to get it because this game is the best game of all time . I still think that this game is the only good game for dreamcast ! They sohld make this game for every system like the Tony Hawk series becase this is a great fighting game.Let me tell you about Maxi . His weapon is the nunchaku and it is very fast and only very experienced people could see his moves soming . They are also very coolto watch . You might find yourself trying to do those moves ( I tried to do them ) He has a lot of combos.The most powerful person is Nightmare . He has the Soul Blade and can destroy a lot of things in his way . But beware ! His moves are sooo slow , everyone can counter them ! The weakest person I would say is Taki or another chinese girl . THe are fast and efficient but you would find yourself trying to puch and pull . They are n't that strong . To make up their strengh , they have quick speeds and fast attacks.Here is a study for the boss , inferno . He is a flame and to my opinion the hardest to beat . He only has like 4 moves of his own but every time you battle him , he can be one of any of the fighters . When I mean that , He has a same weopon as that fighter and the same moves but He is still a ball of flame . His moves are really powerful and you can like take the person out in like 3 moves . His stage is in Space and very creepy compared to some of the other stages.Edge master is just like Inferno except he does n't have any & quot ; only him & quot ; moves . He is the master of weapons but not as powerful as Inferno . He is a old man who has a very long beard . His hair is either red or white depending on his costume.AHH . Soul Calibur is a excellent game and I hope if you have a dreacast , BUY THIS GAMEthanks for taking the time to read my reviewAlan Y .	1
There is doubt about it , this was the game that showed the dreamcast could be a major competitor . Being a big fan of the arcade version , I must say ( for the billionth time ) , that this one surapasses the arcade version . This is a very strategic fighting game , And it is extremely deep gameplay . Although my only compaint is that a button masher can beat the computer . That is my compliant about all 3-d fighting game ( as opposed to earlier , Street Fighter2 , And Street fighter alpa , series games . ) , is that button mashing can get you over . Although , in 3-d fighting games ( like Tekken and , of course Soul Calibur ) , you cant pull off impressive , beautiful , combos with just button mashing . For the most part , this game has alot of relay value , lots of of unlockable characters . The mssion mode , which adds even more to replay value , and the cool museum mode . In my opinion , Time attack mode , is useless . The survival mode , while great , is just too easy . Another problem , the final Boss , Inferno . He is pretty easy as well . But this is common in 3-d fighters . But all in all this is a solid fighting game . It is just a bit too easy . Even ultra hard mode , can be easily won by a competent Soul Calibur player . ( although button mashers can win the first two stages ) . This game is a must-have for Dreamcast owners .	1
One of the few games I actually bought for the Dreamcast while I owned one.I was raised on a steady diet of Mortal Kombat and nothing really prepared me for how hard this game was.I 'll keep it short.The graphics ? Astounding.The game play ? A brutal revelation.Incredible story lines.This game can be picked up and played by anyone but trust me ... on the more difficult settings this is no button masher.You better know your character inside and out or you wo n't last a minute.I 'll sum it up.Awesome weapons based combat.One of the deepest fighters out there.Not for the fighting faint of heart.Recommended .	1
Until Soul Calibur 2 hits the shelves , I am not going to disconnect my Dreamcast . Soul Calibur is still the best game ever , and for the prices they are now , is better to buy a Dreamcast and this game than to buy a $ 50 game for any other console .	1
Even with the new consoles on the market , this game is still the best fighting game out there . Just so you all know , the Dreamcast is a 128 bit system just like the others . So , the graphics can be just as good . Could have used a few more fighters , but that 's my only complaint . The backgounds are breath taking . The fighters have THE coolest specials moves I 've ever seen . And , the special moves ar n't really all that hard to use . You can get to them a lot of times with just a bit of luck . Some of the other fighting games I 've played , I was never able to make them do the really cool moves because they were too complicated to pull off . So , I never got to see them . This is a must have game for Dreamcast owners.Revision : This is still the best fighting game out . Even with the XBox and PS2 out . Me and a friend still hook up the old Dreamcast to play this from time to time . Ca n't wait untill the next one . As of this new review , this will selling on Amazon.com for more than it was when Dreamcast was still out . I guess that tells you a little something about how good this game is .	1
I got this game back in 1999 when I first got my dreamcast . This game is still coming out with sequels . I think that this is a great game !	1
This game was the best thing that came from the Dreamcast , aside from HOUSE OF THE DEAD . This was one of my main reasons for getting the Dreamcast . The graphics were awesome and the replay to this game was great.The second installment of the very popular Arcade smash Soul Blade , had much better graphics than the first , very fluid fights , new characters that rocked ( and also a surprise cameo by Tekken 's Yoshimitsu ) . Plus a lot of new weapons and fighting styles like a 3/4 staff , a sword with a chain attached to it , the Shaolin sword style and even some returing favorites like the short sword and Samurai sword.This game rocked ! I still play this game eventhough the Dreamcast is more or less no more . This is a great game , if yuou have a Dreamcast , you need this game . It 's almost a requirement !	1
I have been a fan of fighters for some time now , old and new and one seems to stand out . Soul Calibur is the fastest , strongest , and most entertaining of all . It 's got everything a fighter should have with no hang ups at all . A large selection of characters ( loads of unlockable ones as well ) , Number of stunning arenas , and multiple modes of game play that will never get boring . I reccomend this title to any gamer no matter what you like . Ca n't go wrong . The best fighter to date , Weapons down .	1
Great game one of the best for DreamCast especially if you like fighting games . If your just picking up a dreamcast and looking at games and own the later soul caliburs ( SC2-4 are out at the time of this review ) you will in my oppinion still find this game enjoyable its fell is much the same as SC2 . Though I personaly enjoy this SC over SC2.The only con to this game is the lack of costumes for characters ( Most have two a select few have an unlockable 3rd ) . Also mission mode is a little on the short side a little easier then SC2 . Other then those two things this is a great game . A must have for DC .	1
I have owned my Dreamcast for nearly a yera now and had been waiting to find a solid fighting game . Many people say that Tekken Tag Team for the PS2 is amuch better game , but it is basically the same as Tekken 3 with enhanced graphics and does n't have all the things that make Soul Calibur so much fun . I was thinking about looking for Virtua Fighter , but then saw a review that gave Soul Calibur 10 out of 10 . I read the review that it was like Virtua Fighter , but with way better graphics , more fighting stages and of course , awesome weapons to fight with . This game has several modes in it including vs. where you can play head-to-head aginst a friend , and arcade mode which is the best and most fun mode in this game . In arcade mode you chose one of several characters to fight with . Each character has different weapons like axes , swords , num-chucks , etc . and different strengths and weaknesses . After you have succesfully beaten all 8 stages you will un-lock a new stage to fight on or a new & quot ; soul & quot ; or character to fight with that is usually much stronger than the normal characters . If you are looking for a fighting game for your Dreamcast , Soul Calibur is a must-have . And at the price of Dreamcast games these days , you just ca n't pass up the price on this great game .	1
Even though it 's over a year old , Soul Calibur is not only the best-looking Dreamcast game there is , it 's the best 3D fighting game on the planet . Period . Nothing comes close . A lot of people say Tekken Tag for the PS2 is a better game , but Tag is merely a rehash of Tekken 3 with updated graphics , and Dead or Alive 2 just does n't have the same shine . Soul Calibur introduced so many new ideas to the genre of 3D fighting that it 's hard to think how anyone will surpass it : the 8-Way run system and Guard Impact are just two of them . The graphics are flawless 60 fps glory , the sound crystal , the backgrounds enthralling . Mission Mode and the huge unlockable Art Gallery send replay value through the roof , but the true treasure here is the combat system . Helped by pinpoint control , beginners and veterans alike will find no end to the depth of the fighting engine that the 8-Way Run system opens up , allowing your fighter mobility across the entire surface of the arena . People are still talking about the huge leap Soul Calibur represents for fighting games . Namco has produced a work of art that also happens to be the most flawless game I 've ever played -- a year later it 's still the most played game on my Dreamcast and I 'm still discovering new moves and techniques . Soul Calibur has sold many Dreamcast systems ( my own and all my friends ' as well ) , and at the price the system and the game are now , it 's an ABSOLUTE STEAL . Everyone who 's even remotely interested in gaming owes it to themselves to experience this piece of history -- games like this do n't happen often , folks .	1
Not that this game is `` old '' , but when you consider it 's a game from 1999 that 's exclusive to a dead console system , it 's amazing to realize that this game is arguably better than any other combat game out there even today . The graphics made full use of the Dreamcast 's capabilities , and even now it is one of the most beautiful games I 've ever seen . The combat moves are fluid and based on real martial arts ... there is even a martial arts display mode where you can see all the characters doing various weapon katas ! It is a good game for both button mashers and pros . There is no `` blood '' which makes it a bit unrealistic when you see someone getting hacked with a huge axe and not bleeding ; but that does n't detract from the experience because this is n't that sort of game . The abundance of modes allows for a high replay value . The only thing I would knock is the end-stories , which are a bit corny and considering the animation in the gamplay itself , it feels a bit like a copout to see the endings as just still life . However , that 's all nitpicking.This game is the reason to buy a dreamcast , and it is still worth it to buy this game and then go find someone selling a dreamcast so you can buy and play it . Have fun !	1
This is a really amazing game , and I 'm not even that big of a fan of fighting games.The graphics , moves , settings , and so on are just incredible . I 've played some 3-D games where bad camera angles gets to be an annoyance , but this game seems really smart about that - you do n't even notice it most of the time , feels very cinematic.A good variety of characters , each of which is very unique in style , moves , and controls.I think the best thing about it is the wide variety of modes . There is a regular arcade mode where you strive to beat computer controlled enemies , or duel with your friends . There 's a practice mode where you can learn all the cool moves for your character ( including lists of all the moves and demos of how to do them and what they do ) . There 's a mission mode where you have to achieve various goals in the fights ( such as , number of hits rather than life totals decides the fight ) or some things are different ( the one where the rats crawling around will bite the characters in the feet and bring them down is hilarious ) . Achieving the goals , or defeating the solo arcade version of the game , can make available new characters , costumes , and settings . And some other modes that I have n't explored yet ! The tight outfits and realism of the graphics make for a fair bit of beefcake/cheesecake , so if you find that sort of thing offensive , be careful . It 's still pretty tasteful in that regard . If you 're offended by violence , well , this is a fighting game ! Although there 's no gore , you do get to do things like whack your opponent a couple of times after you 've defeated them so that you can watch them writhe in agony.Thanks to the practice mode , even an old clumsy person like me can learn enough of the wild moves to make it really fun . Of course , I still get destroyed against people who know what they 're doing ( there 's a lot of depth to the blocking/countering strategies ) , but it 's still a blast . I 'm always seeing new moves and other things that surprise .	1
Hands down the greatest fighting game ever made . Almost a decade after its release it still tops of even the newest fighters out there . Dreamcast had the most potentioal over all the other systems , to bad Sega Sold out . Every character , level , skill , story goes above and beyond . Top 's the most recent Soul Calibur 4 that was released this past July . This game should be ported exactly the way it is to Next-Generation systems with a graphic enchancement.To bad many have not been able to witness the first Soul Calibur because it was on the Dreamcast.It needs to get recognized by the Nex-Generation gamers .	1
It received rave reviews as essentially flawless at the time and the graphics definitely hold their own over a decade later . How many games can you say that about without being unrealistically optimistic ? Soul Calibur for Dreamcast has highly fluid game play , taking the very best elements of other fighting games of the time and turning them into something beautiful . If you have a Dreamcast , this title is essential . With unlockable characters and story mode , replay value is extremely high . If you have a & # 34 ; got ta catch 'em all & # 34 ; mentality , the story mode will keep you busy for a very long time . I can not recommend this game highly enough .	1
The Dreamcast certainly had an abundance of fighting games . You could easily fill your shelves with Capcom 's fighters alone . But one title stands as not only the best game on the system , but the one of the greatest games ever made.Soul Calibur was a launch title for the DC but you would n't be able to tell by the level of refinement , both in asthetics and gameplay.First , the graphics are phenomenal for their day . Nothing looked this good back in 1999 on the consoles . The character models were heads and tails above anything gamers had ever saw ; they were clean , smooth , detailed , featured flawless animation , with fantastic effects like clothes and hair waving in the wind . The backgrounds are amazing too , various settings from underground caves , deteriorating castles , and Japanese style training grounds.It also rus in progessive scan with a framerate that never falters no matter how intense battles get . Not only that it looks better than the arcade version , quite possibly the first game to accomplish this feat.Sound is excellent too , even today , the voice work sounds great ( although it is in Japanese , so I ca n't understand it ) . Sound effects are equally impressive , the clash of swords and other weapons sound great , nothing is overdone , or repetivive . The music is wonderful , it 's great to hear it has aged so well , even after all these years . Namco could have easily thown togther some bland 80 's rock styled music , but it would n't have done the game justice . The sweeping classical tunes work rather well with the fast paced , yet tactical gameplay.As far as the gameplay itself , it 's perfectly paced , not too fast , not too slow . It is a game that is easy to learn hard to master . In my opinion , Soul Calibur is the most balanced of any 3D fighter . Even a beginner can pick up a controller , understand the basic concepts of the game and have some success just feeling out the game . However , it 's not like Tekken ( Namco 's other 3D fighter ) that allows button mashers to cheat their way to victory , if a person bothers to learn a characters moves , he can easily devistate a beginner . There are tons of advanced moves beyond just learing a command list , there are techniques such as the advanced guard and the 8-way run to master that seperate the average player to the advanced one . Combine this with strategies that a factored into most 3D fighters like forcing the ring out and using the clock to your advanage and you have a fighter with a serious amount of depth.While soul caibur has tons of depth , it would have not have reached a perfect score had it not taken it to the next level , and by that I mean modes . That is the mistake that Virtua Fighter 3tb made . Namco saw fit to make Soul Calibur on the dreamcast the most ambitious 3D fighter to date , and they succeeded . They did a wonderful job of adding a fully featured versus mode , team battle , survival , and extra survival ( one hit kill ) , modes , but they all pale in comparison to mission mode.Mission mode is by far the greatest feature of Soul Calibur . Unlike Soul Blade where you had a handful of character specific missions that were n't very fun , Mission mode allows you to pick any character that you desire and progress at your own pace . Missions range from winning with a ring out , to survival matches , and later throw in more obsure challenges . While they are challenging , they are for the most part , fair . As you beat each of these mode you will acquire points to buy artwork ; purchasing this artwork will unlock more missions , costumes , characters and stages . By the time you finish this mode not only will you be an accoplished swordsman , but you will have a robust amount of content to show for your efforts.There is a reason Soul Calibur has the reputation that it doesn 12 years later . The game is simply stellar . It has aged rather gracefully and is the best game on the DC . The game is also available through Xbox live for $ 10 but omits the mission mode and has everything already unlocked . This is truly the version to get if you want to fully experience the games as it was intended by Namco . I highly reccomend this game as one of the greatest games ever made .	1
I am a huge fighting game fan , but I 've never liked the button mashing variety of fighting games.Until now . Soul Calibur is a fun game that keeps me coming back for more . From powerful brutes like nightmare and asteroth to fast fighters like Sophitia and taki to everyone else in between , this game is one of my favorites.It 's simple enough to pick up for anyone . 1 button for horizantal strikes , 1 for vertical strikes , 1 for kicks and 1 for blocking . But the strength likes in it 's combo system . Even a newbie can get some combos by mashing buttons , but someone who knows what thier doing can wipe the floor with all challengers.In short , Best fighting game ever .	1
So I 'm sure you 've played fighting games before , well forget & quot ; Mortal Kombat & quot ; , and & quot ; Tekken & quot ; because & quot ; Soul Calibur & quot ; is the new wave of fighting games . & quot ; Soul Calibur & quot ; is n't just a fighting game , it contains other great elements such as Misson battles in which you are given a mission by the game to complete . And in completing the mission you are given points to unlock items in the Art Gallery which contains drawings and artwork from the game ( very interesting to look at might I add ! ) . The game also allows you to unlock new characters as well as choose another look for your character . This game is very entertaining as it breaks the rules of fighting games . Because it is n't JUST a fighting game , there is so much more you can do . There also are other modes such as & quot ; Time Attack & quot ; and & quot ; Survival & quot ; that put you against the CPU in a race for time . The background music is wonderful , the graphics are ahead of their time , and its great to hear the characters speak in Japanese . Again , this is a superb game this is worth owning a Dreamcast for !	1
Soul Calibur is the classic version of the arcade game , and is only available on the Dreamcast . For many , it 's the main reason to buy a Dreamcast ! You get a nice selection of characters , both male and female , young and old . If there 's a complaint about the characters , it 's that the females tend to have VERY skimpy outfits that mostly show off jiggly breasts and lots of underwear . The guys tend to have fully covered bodies . Something 's not quite even here.There are a number of modes , between simple arcade mode , one on one combat , training demos , and more . As you play through the game you earn points , which let you unlock more secrets . It encourages you to go through the game as each character , learning their best moves and techniques . Each character has his or her own favorite weapons and combat style.As with all fighting games , you have to get used to the violence . The characters are bashing each other with some rather nasty moves - and it does n't necessarily stop when one person is defeated . I 've seen my character kicked to the ground , the game announce my defeat , and then the enemy throw in a final , gratuitous kick . It 's very discouraging.The different levels are fun , with their atmosphere and backgrounds . The music is on the generic side and does n't go themed with the world you 're in , as more modern fighters tend to do . Also it is sometimes fairly easy to simply knock your opponent out of the ring and be done with it.Also , on the sounds angle , there are only a limited number of things that the announcer says . So if you play a given character through an 8 round series of fights , you are going to hear the same thing over and over again.That all being said , this is a true classic of a game and many people have become quite fond of the sequels . So if you 're into inexpensive fighters , or if you 're a Soul Calibur fan who wants to see where it all began , this is a must have !	1
Soul Calibur is one of the best games that I have ever played on any game console . Mitsurugi is my favorite character but there are several characters that I like in the game . The graphics are very impressive , second only to Dead or Alive 2 as far as fighting games are concerned . But what makes this game one of the best fighting games on any system is that it is the most sophisticated fighting game that is out now . You have arcade , team battle , time attack , survival , extra survival , practice , mission battle mode , exhibition mode , battle theater mode , art gallery mode , profile mode , several different extra characters , and tons of other stuff . The Mission battle mode along has several different ways to play the game which will add interest to playing the game for a very long time . First you have to earn most of the secrets in the game by beating the mission battle mode and then after you beat it ( very long and challenging ) , you can still play it again . Anybody that has a Dreamcast and likes fighting games should definitely get this game .	1
Hands-down , this is the best fighting game that I have ever played . The fighting system is deep and complex , but does n't have the huge learning curve that Tekken does . I have heard people call battles played by expert players to be like a dance , with blocking , parrying , dodging , and a variety of attacks used to keep your opponent guessing . A good selection of characters are available , though some are just mirrors of other characters with a few different moves . There is also a practice mode that helps you to learn button combinations for the 50 moves for each character ( pretty standard nowadays , but Soul Calibur was one of the first to do this to my knowledge ) . The soundtrack is excellent , the gameplay is excellent , and it 's just an overall awesome game . Back before the ps2/gamecube/xbox came out , this was the REASON you bought a dreamcast . If you dont own those 3 systems and ca n't get Soul Calibur 2 , get the original . It 's very much worth it .	1
Soul Caliber - Circa 2001GOOD : - Good/Tight controls- Nicely balanced gameplay- Lots of different and unique fighters- Minutes to learn years to master gameplay- Some nice unlockables like new Fighters , costumes , stages and other bonuses- A 3D fighting game that really uses the 3D space ( with eight way run ) - Considered a classic to many hardcore fighting fanaticsBAD : - Non- traditional fighting gameplay , might alienate some more traditional fighting game fans- Have to unlock most of the game through the story/quest modeIF IT FITS YOUR TASTE : - Has medieval theme , both European and Chinese/Japanese- Not traditional fighting game in the sense that there is no real combos and supers , or even projectile moves- Game has built in quest mode , where you pick a fighter and complete a number of challenges , the end result is you unlock more content and are a better player- Fight with weapons , like a 3D Samurai ShowdownGAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO : - Soul Caliber 2- Tekken 3- Samurai ShowdownADDITIONAL NOTES : - You can unlock a mode that lets you Customize your intro ( by picking who will be in the intro of the game at which points )	1
By far one of the greatest games i have ever played . Great story , mind-blowing graphics , awesome characters and more . Everything about this game is incredible , right down to the realistic breathing motions of the characters ! The soundtrack is the best I have heard out of any fighting game to date . I am desperately trying to find it , but i still ca n't . Let me know if you do ! Lots of game modes and jam-packed with secrets . It will take you a long time to get bored with this game ! This is the only reason I have n't sold my DC yet , since Sega abandoned it .	1
This is without a doubt the best game for the Dreamcast . If you own this game and you have friends or family for competition around to compete with then you know exactly what I am talking about.Classic fighting game . Namco did something right here . They created a perfect fighting game . This was an arcade , but did n't get any attention like the great Teken series.This game looks just like the arcade if not better . Sega really came though . I have a dreamcast and only 3 games . This is one of them . This came is the main reason I purchased the Dreamcast almost 2 years ago.The characters are the best I have ever seen . With ease they blow away simple characters like Sub Zero , Ryu , or Paul from other fighting games.The weapon advancement to each figher is pretty brillant also . The sound for this classic is nice too.Each character has his or her own stage . The stages are mind-blowing . Do n't just take my word for it , rent the game and waste 4 or 5 dollars becaues after you play it you are going out to your local Best Buy to get this game.ITS THAT GOOD . Give credit where credit is due . Thanks Namco for making the perfect fighting game .	1
When Namco introduced Pole Position , they revolutionized gaming forever . When Namco introduced Dig Dug , they revolutionized gaming forever . When Namco introduced Pac-man , they revolutionized gaming forever . When Namco introduced Soul Calibur ... you know the rest.The unanimous vote for best fighting game ever made was given to this game . Soul Calibur is indeed the best fighting game ever made . With seemingly endless & quot ; goodies , & quot ; intense battles , beautiful artwork , incredible graphics , Namco has once again revolutionized gaming forever ( surprise ! ) . With nineteen playable characters ( I think ) , this game never ends.There is a Mission Battle mode in which you fight battles to earn points which , in turn , will buy cards with artwork on them . Some cards unlock costumes , some unlock whole levels . A few unlock whole new modes . That 's all I have to say about this , except for : BUY THIS GAME ! !	1
One of the first games ever released for the Dreamcast , and one of the best , Soul Calibur is amazing from start to finish . The graphics , control , special features , and fighting engine are superb , and this is the one game that if you own a Dreamcast you must have this as well . However , good luck finding it , when the Dreamcast came out , it sold pretty quickly , and Namco only released the game in limited quanitites , but this is one hell of a game , and its a better investment to buy a Dreamcast and this game rather than lay down 50 bucks for a single game on any of the other systems .	1
Namco has set a new standard of graphics and gameplay for the fighting game genre with Soul Calibur . This game surpasses every 3D fighting game in a number of categories . Fresh characters , responsive and balanced gameplay , incredible graphics , jaw dropping animation , lots of replay value , and even great music can be found in Soul Calibur . Not only is this a perfect arcade conversion , it actually has even better and more polished graphics than the arcade game . If you have a Dreamcast and are a fan of fighting games , your collection is not complete without Soul Calibur . Play it for yourself and find out why . Hopefully Namco will take their time with the sequel , because it 's going to take alot of effort to make a fighting game better than this .	1
First of all this game has awesome graphics , nothing on any other system/computer compares to them . The game is fun with a bunch of characters , and several that are unlockable , plus a mission mode where you have certain goals with story elements that comply with the story of the game , playing through the mission mode you earn points so you can spend them to view artwork , viewing the art can unlock new options , arenas etc . Buy it .	1
I 'm make this short and sweet . This is the greatest fighting game ever . And this is a DC exclusive and will forever be one of the best DC games ever . It has everything I love about fighting games . First off the visuals are just so juicy . Not as sharp as SC2 but still great visuals even for this time of the year . The game has some really great things added to this DC version such as a mission mode , it 's like a story mode , what you do is buy art galleries to start new mission , trust me it 'll keep you in for weeks especially since it 's for EVERY CHARACTER ! The game has some other neat things added to this game such asPracticemodeMission ModeSurvival ModeARCADE MODE , which you can unlock characters.And some other neat things but I will tell you right now if you do have a Dreamcast do n't keep it to dust and play GTA on your Ps2 . You need this game for the Dreamcast . This is one of the reasons people got a Dreamcast ... .I got it as a gift from my aunt and took advantage of it by getting the games..And this gem was one of them . Listen..do your self a favor and get this game ... heck even Gamespot gave this game 10 and it 's extreamly hard getting a good score on this game.. The visuals ar n't as great as SC2 and that is pretty much the only thing wrong with it.. Bottom lineGoodSuperb Visuals on the DCGreat extras for the DC versionMISSION MODE ROCKSControlls are easy to get use toLoads of play time and Arcade Mode is a blastBad..Hmmm ... .NothingUglyNothing ... GREATEST FIGHTING GAME EVER ONLY ON THE DREAMCAST ! I give it a 5 out of 5 stars ! ! Lates	1
The only draw back with this game is it gets kind of boring but its a great game that put bypassed the arcade by far ! This is a game I wont forget .	1
Soulcalibur is the best game on the Sega Dreamcast- it 's as simple as that . I ca n't even explain in words what this game has to offer ! I had never been a huge fan of fighting games , but when I played this , the tables turned . This game has the most depth and detailed graphics of any I 've ever seen by far . It has probably the most beautiful backgrounds ever , perfect gameplay , an astounding soundtrack , fast weapon-clinging action , just to name a few . That 's not even mentioning all the game modes and the exquisite art gallery . The character detail and design is so colorful , real , artistic , and smooth it 'll blow your mind . This game is the mother of all fighting games , blowing any Tekken ( especially Tag Tournament ) into the ground . Tekken would be good if you could move faster than a turtle . Plus it 's some really good epic scenes of each character , and each character is unique , in both multiple costumes and weapon use . Their names are even awesome , their outfits , moves , fast action combos , etc . This game is just too much to talk about- you have to see this for yourself ! Fighting has never been better ! If I owned Sega , the Dreamcast would come with this game at a minimum ! This is a MUST OWN title for this system- it 's incomplete without it ! Buy it today !	1
In 1996 Namco released a game called Soul Blaade in North America ( known as Soul Edge in Japan ) and it was a game that focused on weapons based combat and centered on several characters going after a sword called Soul Edge . Either to destroy it or attain it for their own means . When Namco began talking about a sequel one of the first things they knew they wanted to incorporate was the use of the entire arena instead of just characters moving on one line . This eventually lead the creation of 8 way run . Where one could -- literally -- walk circles around their opponent . But was it right to simply call it Soul Blade 2 ? Project Soul thought not . Instead they called their new creative and innovative fighter : Soul Calibur.Though not having a fantastic run in Arcades , the game was ported to the Dreamcast in 1999 and launched with the system . When it was released it was such a smashing success and offered so much for players that we had a new champion of fighters . It was simple enough for newcomers but had enough depth for experts . But more than that , 8 way run and the detail the game had was , at the time , just unheard of . Looking at it now , it 's hard to believe the game was originally made in 1998 . It was not only well ahead of its time , but the only game that really seemed to give it any competition was the release of Soul Calibur II years later . Since it 's release the original Soul Calibur has gone on to be recognized as one of the greatest and most innovative games ever made . And to this day , the only game that is really like Soul Calibur are the other Soul Calibur games.Many fighting games are not much for their stories . A lot of them can tell a story but they 're primarily about the fighting . The original Soul Calibur is the same way , but there is actually an emphasis on characters and the relationships that these characters feel they have with other characters . Every character has their own unique ending to Arcade Mode and every character has a biography that you can read to learn about them . There 's definitely a story and a narrative at work here . As you read about the characters you 'll learn as to why each of them are going after Soul Edge . Their stories are tragic but interesting . It 's even more fun for those who played the original Soul Blade . Things had n't become quite convoluted with the story yet . And when you read about all these characters some of them you 're bound to find intriguing in their own way . You may even find yourself having a favorite . Not just because of how they fight ... but because of who they are as a person . They 've got personality here and it shows not only in their exchanges in combat , their endings in Arcade and their biographies , but also in just how well they fight.Soul Calibur has a simple way of fighting . You 've got horizontal , vertical and kick attacks . You can also guard and , of course , move all around the ring . You can also combine attacks by pressing two buttons simultaneously for different attacks . The implimentation of 8 way run really increases the number of moves which can be done . It 's simple to pick up Soul Calibur but the game itself is fairly difficult to master . Unlike other games , there is actually qutie an emphasis on pokes , precise strikes and quick moves rather than emphasising the need to learn tons of special moves and combos . It certainly does n't hurt to learn these things , but no one will feel powerless when playing Soul Calibur . But it does have a few complex moves and combos none the less . Some characters have slide input movements while others may have attacks that require much more precise timing . Anyone can pick up the game and utilize pokes , but a true master will actually have to sit down and train with some of their favorite characters.It 's also to no surprise that Soul Calibur does put a huge emphasis on the player 's ability to move all over the arena instead of just in a straight line where they my have moves that step to the side . This is emphasized by the fact that any character can also attack while circling another . Or they can use this to side step opponents . This was n't just some gimmick thrown in , this was pretty much what Soul Calibur was all about . To put more emphasis on this , Soul Calibur allows players to knock one another out of the ring . If there was anything that stood out in Soul Calibur as a real flaw it MIGHT be this little tidbit . Unlike future games in the series , the first game made knocking someone out of the ring a fairly simple thing to do . Characters went out of the ring far more easily than otherwise . And while it 's great to snatch a victory through ring out , it can be a pain when you suffered a ring out just because a very small portion went over the ring.Aside from that , Soul Calibur was a nearly flawless game . It managed to do this by offering players what the Arcade could n't . Before Soul Calibur came out in 1999 if you wanted the best graphics and best experience with fighting games you typically went to Arcade to have it . Soul Calibur was one of the games that helped to change this , in part because of the Dreamcast . The Dreamcast version of the game looked and sounded better than the Arcade version . The stages were more detailed . The backgrounds , rather than being pre-rendered , were actually in 3D . The game was the prettiest thing on the market in 1999 . And the characters were also detailed . The console version of the game also offered different modes . You had the typical Arcade mode , but the game also gave you a survival mode and things to keep you busy such as the game 's Mission Mode . Where you went to various stages to partake in missions . These missions earned you points , which you could exchange in the Art Gallery . Sometimes when you bought art in the gallery you unlocked other missions , stages or character exhibition theaters . There was a lot to unlock in Soul Calibur . It was an experience you simply could n't have in the Arcade.As a result , Soul Calibur has also managed to age well , in part because it was so far ahead of its time . In fact , its sequels can only seem to do worse because aside from tweaking characters and adding moves , there is n't really much you can do to improve the experience of Soul Calibur . A franchise that achieves this much critical and commercial success right out of the gate does n't really have anywhere to go but down . And indeed , the Soul Calibur series has often been criticized that not much has been done to the basic formula as the years have gone by . But when you play the first game it becomes apparent that it 's really hard to build on that particular foundation . We 're talking about a game that was hailed by critics and consumers as one of the greatest games of all time when it first dropped onto the Dreamcast in 1999 ( and is one of the few games on Amazon that still retains a five star rating years later ) . Where exactly do you go from `` Greatest , '' exactly ? No where , really . But it seems to be a testament as to how powerful and impactful Soul Calibur really ended up being . The original still manages to be a strong game even by todays standards.The Soul continues to burn bright and those who still have their Dreamcast should own this game . It is not just one of the best games you can find on the system , but still remains as one of the greatest games ever made .	1
Forget any other reason for buying a Dreamcast -- Soul Calibur remains as the sole good reason for spending the money . It 's worth the money , it 's worth the money , and it 's worth your time to check it out . You may have some trouble grabbing a copy of Soul Calibur , because every Dreamcast owner probably purchased this at the counter when picking up their system . Soul Calibur is the ultimate in fighting games - sleek , graphically unparalleled , and deep - and ranks as the best fighting game out there . It 's set apart from its competitors by the double knockout of a great look and solid game play . Based on last years hit arcade game , and a sequel to the smash PlayStation hit , Soul Blade , Soul Calibur pits ten fighters against each other in a standard two-out-of three battle for supremacy . But might does n't always make for right in this game . Soul Calibur is unprecedented in its game balance , with large , impressive bulky fighters on the same ground as small , fast players . The ten starting fighters are just that - a starting lineup . Through game play and advancement you 'll uncover many cameo fighters , like Yoshimitsu from Tekken , and Seung Mina and Hwang from Soul Blade . There are also mystery stages and costume changes to uncover . Soul Calibur also offers many new options that the arcade version could n't . Battle Mode , Team Battle , and Survival modes all lend the game an enormous replay value , while the sometimes complicated move system is helped out by a very thorough Practice mode that explains every move and shows you how to execute them . Graphically , the game evolves past its arcade counterpart in every respect , with incredible detail and superior polygon counts . Soul Calibur on the Dreamcast is without a doubt the best looking fighting game ever , with nuances like muscle rippling , facial expressions of pain , fear , and anger , and caustic lighting effects that dazzle the eyes . The game also excels in the area of sound , achieving what other games only dream of - the perfect balance of music , voice , and sound effects . Clashing swords , primal yelling , and blood-pumping heroic themes course through the game , all meshing for the perfect sonic mix . Namco has retooled the fighting dynamics so that both button-mashers and serious students of ass-whupping can both benefit and prosper in the game . Although novices can easily beat the game on easier settings , the game definitely favors those who understand Soul Calibur 's complexities , like dodging , vertical and 8-way run attacks , and stagger blocking . Someone who has mastered the arcade game will find the differences in the moves trifling , while every one else will scarcely notice . What are you waiting for ? Sonic can wait , TrickStyle will still be pulling tricks next week , and NFL 2K has a millenium ahead of it . There 's no excuse for you not to be enjoying the best fighting game this year , and possibly the best ever . Power Stone and the laughable Mortal Kombat Gold ca n't touch the soul of this fighter , but you can .	1
One of the best fighters ever made , actually quite possible the best fighter ever made thus far . Graphics far superior to Tekken or Dead or Alive 2 , this game rocks . There is so much to do , you unlock all kinds of good stuff by fighting like galleries of art new costumes , and levels to fight on and more . This game has great strategy in it as well as it is not like Marvel vs Capcom where you just push buttons and pull off random power moves . This game is exceptional and I own it since the Dreamcast debut !	1
I grew up playing Mortal Kombat . I was a fan of the series up to it 's 3D debut , when it really began spiraling down-hill . Soul Calibur is the first 3D fighter that I felt is worth the buy . It has a deep storyline , as deep as fighting games get . It includes TONS of secrets that can be accessed by playing through the games on various modes . The graphics are the best you can find on ANY system . Buy the game if you even remotely like fighting games . If you do n't ... what is wrong with you ?	1
You ca n't beat the classics : NES SNES and now even N64 is considered classic . Mario Golf will be fun for the rest of my life . The game itself is in great condition and I will be playing this one frequently .	1
When I first played this game , I knew next to nothing about the sport of golf . I rented it for three days , not only learning how to play golf , but quickly becoming horribly addicted to it.A month later I now own this fabulous game , and I also play golf too , although my real game needs some work , Mario Golf does n't . It 's fun , challenging experience that everyone can enjoy . Bring over your three friends and play all night , it 's the best golf game ever made .	1
Awesome Golf game for the N64 if you are an old Nintendo freak add this one to your collection it provides hours of fun .	1
The Golfing Is Nice And Smooth In This Game And Also There Is Lots Of Playable Characters.The Golf Courses Look Very Good And Just About Everything In The Game Has Nice Things To Offer.Any N64 Owner Should Defintely Check This Game Out	1
I was the biggest fan of NES Open , one of the last games made for the original Nintendo Entertainment System . It was a golf game that featured betting , longest drive contests , and a tournament where you could name all your competitors . Most golf games I 've played focused more on having a big name ( i.e . Tiger Woods ) than fun . But NES Open was great fun , and I thought it 'd never be beat . I 'm eating my words . Mario Golf is one of the most fun games , period . So many options ... you can play the tournament , ring shot , speed golf , play characters and keep them , mini golf , skins and more . The suspense of the match game is the best . It 's going to take me forever to achieve everything on this game . The ONLY complaint is that the mini-golf is really uncreative . Other than that ... it 's perfect .	1
Love this game . Play it non-stop and might just be re-addicted to it . Works great , and have had no problems with it .	1
I 've played this game extensively , and it really is my favorite golf game . I even prefer it to the more realistic games out there . It has perfect control , fun and varied courses , Nintendo characters , and four people can play at a time ! It 's just plain fun .	1
This game is excellent . The replay value is infinite- there are many characters , courses , etc . available for the dedicated player to find . On top of that , there are multiple modes for up to four players ( Two or three players is usually enough though- with 4 players people usually get bored ) The graphics are adequate for the game . However , the sound is pretty abysmal . The music is absolutely terrible on almost every course- and it is recommended that you turn it off.I also would have enjoyed a create-a-player mode . However , this game is the best fun golfing can offer with its many courses , characters , and game modes .	1
Not that many golf games in the video game industry can actually sell very , very well . Most of them use a major player 's name , and suppose to have their `` skills '' in the process . Not that many of them can have a strong sense of enjoyment in the golf world , where everyone wants a more serious side in the sports world with football , and basketball . However , Nintendo seemed to hit the nail on the head with their 2000 creation.With Mario Golf , the game consists of the start of four golfers , including Baby Mario , Peach , and a couple of others . Throughout the game , you can access the Get Character mode , which can help you challenge other characters like Mario , Bowser , and Yoshi . Once you win the character , you also need them , the harder the challenger in the round . It is also important in the Tournament mode , where you can also earn enough points toward newer golf courses and challenging holes in the process . Each course reflecting on the cute , Mario Brothers themed style , which makes it appealing to all ages old and young , where the other games do n't seem to have that sense of enjoyment.Although Nintendo stopped making games for the Nintendo 64 , Mario Golf is only one of the very few sports games I highly recommend for the system . Although many people might not see the review , because of the newer game system reviews and newer games of the Gamecube , Xbox , and Playstation 2 .	1
Really fun game for a group of people . Easy to learn how to play . Good variety of courses . I would recommend this game to anyone .	1
I was skeptical when I first rented this video game . I never thought that anything related to golf could be interesting- and ironically I ended up buying this game a day later and playing it for hours and hours , hopelessly addicted to it . Mario Golf has many different playing modes to entertain you - Tournament ( challenging tournaments where you compete for the gold cup ) , Play for a Character mode ( to unlock another character ) and many various speed trials . The characters are the classic Mario , Luigi , Peach , Toad , Bowser , Wario , etc , plus a many more new characters ( kids , snobby golf experts , slick pros ) . This game is challenging but not too hard ( do n't worry , no golf knowledge is required ) . So , basically what I am saying is that this game is excellent- do n't hesitate to try it out !	1
i love N64 games , and this is one of the most fun ones i have . Love the fact i came play as different characters . fun for all ages .	1
If you have any interest in video golf whatsoever , you need to get this game . Nintendo has succeeded in making a golf game that is fun and challenging for young and grown-up people alike.There are several different types of play in the game . You can play by yourself in tournament mode , in head-to-head mode against the computer or other golfers , in ring mode , speed mode , or in mini-golf.Tournament mode is the big one - you start with a variety of Nintendo characters to choose from and one course to play on . Completing rounds earns you experience points , which are used to unlock other courses and characters . You also get trophies for finishing in the top three and Birdie Badges for getting a birdie ( or better ) on a hole . As with similar games , your goal is to unlock all courses and characters and collect all the badges.Head-to-head mode provides another method of unlocking characters . Beating a character in match play enables you to use it in the other modes . The game also saves your records with each character against all the others . The best play with this mode , though , is against other players . You can set handicaps , bet on each hole , the front nine , back nine , closest to pin , longest drive , and you can even play slot-machine golf , where each player gets only a random wood , long iron , and short iron for each hole - if you 're lucky and get three stars , you get the full complement , but if you only get one star , you get one fewer club . Try playing a par-5 hole with your longest club being a 4-iron ! The ring-shot mode is challenging as well - you must hit your ball through one or more rings on the course and finish the hole in par or better . Clearing rings will unlock characters as well . If you think the first few tasks are easy , they will get tougher as you advance ! Character-by-character progress is saved for this as well.Speed golf is interesting - your fastest times on each course are saved , along with your corresponding scores - but not quite as much fine . Mini golf is included as well , but without any rewards I noticed.If you think this is a good game so far , wait till you play the Game Boy version as well . You can use the Transfer Pak ( sold separately , for some reason ) to move your Game Boy character to the N64 version , where you can use your experience to build your character . This is essential for mastering the harder courses and beating the top golfers - your GBC character can become stronger than Wario and hit the ball straighter as well . You can also pit your characters against your friends ' characters or trade them ( if you 're so inclined ) . Finally , you can send your N64 status back to your GBC and view it in more detail there - you can see each character 's best score on each course.Even without the GBC version , this is a top-flight golf game in its own light . Add the Game Boy Color version and a Transfer Pak and you have a keeper .	1
I love what I got and I do n't worry about it not having a case as cases waste space ! Thank you !	1
Allright , I admit It When it comes to Gameplay This Game [ loses ] But When It Comes To Creating Wrestlers This Game Is Revolutionary . The Create-A-Wrestler Feature On This Game Is So Detailed That You Do n't Just Pick The Face , You Pick The Eyes The Nose and The Mouth . You Also Can Put Lettering On Your Clothing , And Have A Wide Variety Of Masks , Face-Paint , And Apparel . With This Game You Could Create The L.O.D. , And Even The Insane Clown Posse ! The Create-A-Wrestler Mode Is So Detailed This Game Is Worth Playing Just For That . I Only Wish That Modern Wrestling Games With C.A.W . Mode Would Take a Page From This Game .	1
Smackdown : Just Bring It for the PS2 and Smackdown 1 and 2 for the PS1 are better . But it is nothing compared to WWF Raw for the XBOX . Raw for the XBOX is better than any of them . But if you have'nt got a PS2 , XBOX , or Gamecube yet this is a must get game . Gameplay is good it just takes a day or maybe a little more to get use to . If you want to save money rent it and smackdown 1 or 2 and see which one you would want to have the most .	1
It is a fun game to revisit after several years but it does get old quickly with having to memorize moves and limited wrestling moves you have access to . It is still an enjoyable game for a few weeks .	1
I personally own this game and can testify to how good it is . WWF attitude has eccellent character selection , and create a player mode ... .for its time . Unfortunately it is getting lost in the shadow of games like Smackdwon 2 with its quick executing of moves , unlike Attitude , and its enormous backstage area , unlike attitude . But on the good side it has some things other games do n't , tag team Gauntlet and its huge hidden character selection that you are always trying to unlock . Great game , i would reccommend it to anyone who likes slowerpace games .	1
I get it , it 's features are lame but for me this game is cool . It was fun to wrestle with even though there were times where the wrestler would run and stay running and never move again , or when you would lift up a wrestler to perform a finisher and they would stay dazed for like a few minutes , corny moments but still good .	1
I enjoy seeing the PPV , smackdown and raw . this one is a rare one to get if you like wwe wrestling .	1
After having pretty bad luck with trilogies ( see Twisted Metal 3 ) , I was somewhat wary about renting Resident Evil 3 . I mean , how could they top a classic like Resident Evil 2 ? And that 's where RE3 is hurt - it 's overshadowed by it 's perfect predecessor and to do anything but copy it would be less than perfection . Given all this , Resident Evil 3 is still a fun and very scary game . The & quot ; fork-in-the-road & quot ; choices you have to make are fun and give the game tons of longevity , as what choices you make change the course of the game . The puzzles can be frustrating and drawn out . Resident Evil 3 is basically Resident Evil 2 with none of the bad points , but missing some of the good points . The infinate ink cartridge is definately welcome in my book . Nemesis is an incredibly scary character . The thing that I was disappointed in was the lack of actual story or any real characterization . There was nothing really added to the storyline that we did n't already know . It was basically just solving puzzles , fighting Nemesis 10,000 times and the big ending . Given all this , Resident Evil 3 is still a fun game that will keep you on the edge of your seat and playing well into the morning hours . Oh yeah , and the bonus game is pretty fun !	1
Resident Evil 3 : Nemesis is the third game in the series ( though it was not intended to be , that was supposed to be Code Veronica , but whatever ) and it is the third best . And that is NOTHING to be ashamed of.This game had a lot to live up to coming on the heels of what is arguably the best game for the entire playstation system , Resident Evil 2.Does it ? Yes and no . It is an amazing game . Jill is hot . The graphics are nice , the music is great and Nemesis is awesome . The only thing this game had going against it was the length felt a bit rushed . There 's not quite as much substance here as in Resident Evil 1 and 2.But Capcom has made up for that with the live decisions that alter gameplay and even endings and the randomness of the game in terms of enemies and items . You never know quite what you 'll get on any given play through.Bottom line , get this game only after getting the first 2 in the series , but please get it . It is much better than Capcom 's lackluster effort at modern Resident Evil games.This game still has soul .	1
This is another great R.E . game with a cool mercenaries game at the end .	1
this i got for my son who loves it more than i can say !	1
Resident Evil 3 : Nemesis is sometimes called the forgotten installment in the Resident Evil series . Other people just call it the least popular . Let 's face it : all the attention went to Resident Evil 1 and 2 because those were the games that were revolutionary . Those were the games that not only brought realistic , never-before-seen gameplay and 3D survival horror graphics to the original Playstation , but the Resident Evil series also made it *very* difficult for any imitators to come along and try to overtake the popularity and success of the Resident Evil series . Capcom knew they had something amazing with this series , and that 's why when video game fans think about being scared and trying to stay alive , the Resident Evil series *immediately* comes to mind.Now , here comes Resident Evil 3 : Nemesis . Correct me if I 'm wrong , but , at the time of its release , this game did n't receive NEARLY as much attention as the previous two Resident Evil games . Maybe it had something to do with the fact that video game fans were anticipating the upcoming release of the Playstation 2 in the year 1999 , or maybe people thought the Resident Evil series was starting to run dry . Nah , I highly doubt that second one is true . Nemesis was just the Resident Evil game that did n't really stand out , despite the many positive reviews of the game that I 'm sure you 've read about . Yes , the game is fantastic , and the fact that so many people would agree with me is more proof that the Resident Evil series was nowhere NEAR ready to be forgotten . Not in this lifetime , baby . It 's just that Nemesis was n't really a drastic jump forward in terms of innovation , like Resident Evil 2 was.I honestly believe , if you have an appetite for running around destroying zombies , that Nemesis is the *perfect* Resident Evil game for you . I was completely taken by surprise as I continued to progress through the game and notice that the amount of zombies and other familiar enemies are absolutely LOADED almost everywhere you go . Zombies left and right ! At the very beginning of the game , when I looked inside that giant item box beside the typewriter , I could n't believe Capcom was so generous as to give me more than enough ammo right from the beginning . I really mean it- you receive a LOT of ammo from your item box . After beating the game , I had a ton of ammo leftover . Now , I realize people will probably look at this as a bad thing , and complain that lots of ammo greatly decreases the challenge and makes progressing through the game a cakewalk . They 'd also have a point if they wanted to complain that giving you loads of easily-available ammo straight from your item box does n't really define `` strategy game '' , since you are n't spending the majority of your time dodging enemies- you can simply walk up to them and shoot them and have *more* than enough ammo available for the next enemy you encounter . They 'd be absolutely correct , on both counts.Capcom is also pretty generous when it comes to those green herbs and first aid sprays . You can find plenty of them throughout the game , just sitting around on the table or floor , making the challenge level go down even more . Oh , and let 's not forget that , in addition to having lots and lots of ammo generously offered to you , you also receive a few awesome weapons such as a machine gun and a shotgun straight from the beginning of the game . Another thing- when you pick up , for example , handgun bullets , you actually receive a LOT of ammo . I believe in Resident Evil 2 each of those orange packs of ammo contained about 15 bullets . In this game , you receive , and I 'm honestly not kidding , around 40-50 bullets per pack . Capcom made running out of ammo something you will NEVER have to worry about.However , in a few ways , the challenge has been increased from Resident Evil 2 . For example , remember how slow the zombies would walk up to you in Resident Evil 2 ? You could practically stand next to them and blast away , and not have to worry about taking any hits . In Nemesis however , zombies are almost RUNNING at you , forcing you to turn around and allow yourself room to shoot . This is awesome , because you wo n't know which zombies are slow pokes and which ones are speed runners until you see one on screen . Oh , and thankfully a quick turnaround button has been included . Press down on the directional pad + the run button to turn right around . Very convenient button.This game is also much scarier , not to mention much bloodier , than the previous Resident Evil game . The last time around , only *sometimes* zombies would break a window and try to attack you ( along with crows , dogs and other dangerous enemies ) . In Nemesis , not only do windows break all the time , but zombies can pop out of cars , jump down from buildings , and other incredible things . Many times you will be caught completely off guard when it happens , too . This is awesome.I love the fact that you actually go back to the police station from the previous Resident Evil game for a short while . You go back , grab some things , and then head back out to the streets again , where most of the game takes place . Interesting how the music from the main hall of the police station has remained exactly the same , and it 's also interesting when you notice certain places blocked off that were very important to access in the previous game with Claire and Leon as your playable characters.You 're probably wondering why the game is called Nemesis . Well , Nemesis is the name of an enormous , persistent and dangerous maniac that , throughout the game , constantly tries to attack you . He can either smack you with his arm , or shoot rockets at you . This does n't make the game as hard as you probably think , because most of the time you can simply run away from him . However , when he appears , get ready to either fight or run away . Do n't stand around too long . Decide quickly ! I want to set the record straight about something . People writing reviews for this game will probably tell you that Nemesis chases you around from the beginning to the end of the game . That 's not exactly true . Yes , it 's true he will be a problem for you until the very last level but , you should know that Nemesis does NOT follow you around for the entirety of the game- he just appears *sometimes* , messes with you by following you into rooms and whatnot , and then he disappears for a while . If you have n't played this game yet , some reviewers will have you convinced that Nemesis will be chasing you around ALL the time -nonstop- and this is NOT true.Probably the biggest challenge comes in the way of puzzle-solving . Now , think back to Resident Evil 2 . What did you have ? You had three or four puzzles to solve . And they were EASY ! In Nemesis , let 's see , you have 10-12 puzzles to solve , and some of them simply ca n't be completed unless you 're either a really excellent puzzle solver , or you look the answers up on the internet.Yes , I 'm talking about that famous , dreaded water puzzle near the end of the game . Honestly , the best way to successfully finish the darn puzzle is to just look up all the possible solutions on the internet , and then write them down . I found seven different answers so far . Do n't feel ashamed for having to look up the answers . This is one of those rare nearly-possible puzzles that you should n't feel bad about for not being able to understand it . Do n't get me wrong- once you find out how to do the puzzle , it 's easy . But if you happen to be mostly familiar with Resident Evil 2 , and think you can go through the game on your own without a walkthrough , looking up help will probably be the best idea when you finally arrive to this puzzle . You 'll be glad when it 's finished ! The game has a good storyline too ( well , by video game standards anyway ) with excellent , action-packed cutscenes located throughout the game . If you consider yourself an action-type person , you will enjoy some of these cutscenes a LOT . I guarantee it . One of them has something to do with a helicopter , and you 'll love watching it.Also , Resident Evil 3 includes an infinite amount of ink ribbons to save your progress , and you now also have an option to skip over dialogue conversations and cutscenes by pressing the select button . You did n't have this in the last game.Overall , I give this game the highest possible score you can give , and that would be 5 stars . It truly deserves it . The fact that you have to face about TWICE as many zombies this time around , and the fact that you are basically outside roaming the streets the entire time are major , major highlights for the game . These streets are deadly . Pick up this game today , and have fun .	1
I am a Dreamcast holdout . And I am proud of it . The DC is ... was the new Resident Evil Machine and every game in the series except for 1 was on it . Which brings me to Resident Evil 3This is the Survival Horror god . RE3 is perhaps the most scary ( insert shocking here ) game of the series I have played yet . Rather than face several boss charactors at obvious areas , Nemisis , the big , bad boss of this game will literally chase you throughout the game . I still remember fondly the first time I saw his distorted face . And I remember well his tenacious persuit of me causing my fingers to curl and my stomach to clench . He is scary.Added to Nemisis himself is the wonderful , useful dodge ability . Tired of Zombies walking through your hail of fire to rip open your neck ? Charge them and push them back ! Tired of spiders wraping their legs around you and pumping you full of poison ? Jump aside . It is so nice to actually roll out of the way of a enemies swinging claws . And RE3 is the only game so far where you get to do this.Finally , the gripes . Although I have not played 1 , RE3 is the shortest of the series I have played . It is also much less epic than 2 or Veronica . If it is lengh and amazing story you are looking for , go for RE code Veronica . But is you want to be gripping the armchair seat and shivering from overdose excitement ... This is the game for you .	1
for any resident evil player 's out there if you played and resident evil and resident evil 2 for the playstation version then you 'll like it .	1
This review is actually in reference to both the Dreamcast version and the Playstation version . For PS 1 , RE 3 offers some of the best graphics available on the system , on DC the graphics are a sore disappointment as there were only minimal improvements , and while it does look better on the DC there are other enhancements that I would have implemented . This game had scared me when I rented it on the PS 1 so bad that I set it aside . It had got my heart racing , the whole running away and running for dear life ... and me without a guidebook ! Several years later I buy the DreamCast version just to complete the collection , and while waiting for the remake of RE 1 for my GCN I dust this game off and played through it , without a guidebook . This time I did n't get spooked at all . I was up pretty late that night I got scared anyway.RE 3 : Nemesis focuses more so on action than anything else , and there is ( thankfully ) more than enough ammo and herbs to go around . I think that this is probably the easiest of the Resident Evil games , not saying that you wo n't encounter the `` You Died '' screen on occasion , but less often than in other installments . This is also the shortest game in the series . The voice acting is dramatically better than previous games , as well as the in game cut scenes a little more fleshed out . However the story is not as fleshed out as it should have been . The game does have some advantages . It is the first game to allow you to ascend and descend stairs without using the action button , and it was the only game of the series to have a functional dodge button , which was great . I also enjoyed the gunpowder mixing . All in all this game is a lot of fun , short , but sweet , and although it is not the pinnacle of the series it is a worthy sequel . Plus the DreamCast version has more than enough extras to keep a person busy for a while . Lie RE 2 this game is being ported to GCN with minimal improvements . I only wish that Capcom would consider a total remake of this game as well with more story elements . If future installments of RE are to keep the tank like movement than I hope that they will reincorporate the dodge button .	1
This game is awesome . The plot is intriguing , the characters are realistic and it has some references to RE2 . It posesses some of the problems that the other RE games had : The controls still { bite } and the inventory system is pretty difficult to deal with at times ( how does a key take up as much space as a shotgun ? ) but you get used to the controls and you just have to deal with the inventory . A nifty new edition is the ability to make new and stronger ammo by creating various combinations of gunpowders . You also become faced with situations where you have to decide what to do and your decision alters the course of the game ( and in one case , which ending you see ! ) which was not seen in the first 2 . You are also stalked by one of the coolest looking monsters ever : the nemesis . temporarily knocking this beast out can yield rewards that can make your life quite a bit easier , but be warned , it is no easy task . Make sure that you are at least familiar with the plot of RE1 before you play this ( RE2 never really comes up ) . very fun and challenging .	1
After replaying both RE and RE2 from my childhood days ; I could n't wait to buy RE3 since I had missed that one growing up and was dying to try it out . Well ... I 've had the game for a few nights ( 7 hours gameplay ) and have already beaten it . And I got ta say it was a fun ride , but I 'm kind of disappointed . I 'm a huge Resident Evil fan and I 've been wanting to play this game for years.Do n't get me wrong the game was very entertaining and still withheld the ability to scare the hell out of me . I did enjoy it a lot , but it just does n't justify itself as much of a sequel in my opinion.Here 's why.First off , whats up with the difficulty modes ? You 're only given two choices ; Hard or Easy . And their both screwed up . Why ? EASY MODE : - The game starts you ( Jill ) off with an assault rifle and 3 F.Aid sprays.- Enemies are way too easy to shrug off.- Jill can take up to 6 bites from a zombie and still be in `` Fine '' condition.- You have infinite ink ribbons.- All of the weapons in the game are already unlocked and located in your storage crate.- You have massive amounts of ammo for each gun already in the storage crate . ( And I 'm talking MASSIVE ) For example : 250 Handgun rounds , 76 Shotgun shells , and 2 100 % AR clips.- Picking up ammo , Gun powder , and health items is pointless since you already have enough of each to last you to the end of the game.- It is not much of a challenge.Needless to say , I quickly changed from Easy to Hard mode after the first 10 minutes of playing . I usually do n't like playing Hard mode on any game . But it did n't leave me much of a choice , and being a RE veteran I figured I could handle it . In other words , Easy mode was obviously designed for newbies and people that absolutely SUCK.HARD MODE : - You start with almost no ammo at all.- Jill takes too much damage even from the smallest attacks.- The new `` dodging '' feature is nearly impossible to use.- Nemesis is way too strong and can kill you in one or two hits.- Jill 's inventory is very small . Unlike the first Resident Evil.- Zombies respawn after you enter and exit a room . ( True , considering the situation and environment does make sense . Like its impossible to kill every zombie in the city . ) Nonetheless I completed the game on Hard . Having died 3 or 4 times being annihilated by Nemesis . My only question is ... why was n't there a `` Normal '' or `` Original '' mode to play ? I like to be challenged and enjoy the game at the same time . Playing on Hard was difficult and irritating . Especially when you have an 8 ft. monster on your tail most of the time.Secondly , the story.STORY : To sum it all up the story is about Jill desperately trying to escape Raccoon city alive . And the first part of the story actually takes place like a day before the events of Resident Evil 2 . The main conflict in the story is that Umbrella corp. has secretly dispatched a mutant tyrant called `` Nemesis '' into Raccoon city to seek out and destroy all the remaining S.T.A.R.S members . Namely Jill and Brad Vickers . I wo n't spoil the ending for anyone and I think most RE fans know what happens anyway.What I did n't like about the story was that it was too confusing . Like , who is Nemesis ? ? Where did he come from ? ? I mean seriously whats his origin ? Also , in RE2 Leon and Claire were looking for Chris , who we later discovered had traveled to Europe . But your telling me that Jill was in the city the whole time ? And not once did Leon and Claire cross paths with her ? Come on ... Another thing that does n't make sense ( keep in mind this is before RE2 ) is when Jill makes her way into the R.P.D . building only to find that half of the doors are boarded up/barricaded having no access . Which would contradict RE2 's plot altogether . How would Leon and Claire get around the building ? It does n't make any sense . Why did n't they just have all of the doors Jill did n't need to go in locked ? The story itself is pretty clustered . And it 's really not even a story , its more like a side-story . It just seems that it was really rushed through and not a lot of thought was put into it.Thirdly , the Nemesis.NEMESIS : Despite what I said earlier.. I thought that Nemesis was a great addition to the game . He definitely adds to the suspense and you never know when or where he 's going to pop up and surprise you . However , it does n't take long to get tired and frustrated with him . Mainly because there were a lot of areas in the city that I wanted to explore but could n't because I was being pursued by Nemesis ! ! ! And he shows up like 15 minutes apart from each appearance . So , exploring or not he 'll always turn up sooner or later . And yes you can fend him off . But there 's really no point since he 's nearly impossible to kill , and your only wasting precious ammo and health trying to fight him . By the way , some of you may remember Mr.X from RE2 ... well there 's a big similarity between the two . Their both huge mutant zombies that stalk you throughout the game . So its quite obvious that Nemesis was a variation of Mr.X.Pros : RE3 did improve and add some great new features . Such as ... The new `` dodge '' feature that really adds to the gameplay and helps a ton when your in combat . It took Capcom 3 games to finally add the 180 degree spin ; which enables you to turn around quickly and run to avoid danger . I also liked the new `` Gun powder '' mixing feature , which enables you to create ammunition for your weapons . There is a lot of action and surprises in the game . Adding the interactive environmental objects ( explosive barrels , etc . ) was a nice feature and really helped in difficult situations . I did really like the outdoor environment in the game . I thought that was a nice break-away from the first two games . And finally , you do n't need to press the action button to go up or down a flight of stairs.Cons : The graphics are the same as in RE and RE2 only with slight improvement on the character models and design . The pre-rendered environments do n't look as good or dark as in RE2 but are still nice . The game itself is very short compared to the first two , and the only playable character is Jill . The camera angles can get annoying sometimes , especially when there is an enemy blocking your view . ( This problem is in the first two games also . ) It was n't as scary , exciting , or suspenseful as RE and RE2 . But still has moments that make you jump out of your seat . And lastly , it lacks a story.Conclusion : Bottom line , RE3 : Nemesis is a good game . It 's fun , scary , and entertaining . And no its not the best , and in my opinion its the weakest game in the series . And anyone who disagrees , obviously has n't played the first two . But I will cut it some slack because Resident evil 3 had a lot to live up to . And it was because Resident Evil 2 really set a high standard for the series . Lets face it , Resident Evil 2 was a legendary game , and quite possibly the greatest sequel to any video game in history . I just think that RE3 could of been a better sequel . And it is n't as good as its predecessor.Final Rating : 3.8/5	1
So far , I 've played 1 , 2 , and 3 , and this is probably my favorite.Gameplay:10/10 : This time you are Jill from the original . Lots of areas , like the city , police station , hospital , park , clock tower , it 's a big game ! You also have a dodge move . And , the stalker zombie , Nemesis , makes the game shine , he 's fun to fight . You also sometimes make choices on events ! And a new Mercanaries mode adds to the fun.Music:8/10 : Your standard horror tunes . Got ta love Nemmy 's theme.Sound:9/10 : Decent voices this time , and cool sound.Overall , if you are looking for a top notch horror game , you got ta get this !	1
In Res Evil two , you had two discs of stuff to get done , one playing as Leon , and the other as Claire . In this one , you are Jill Valentine , and you ca n't really pick anyone else.Still , the weapons in this game improved a great deal ! You get the standard pistol , shotgun etc ... but there are improved bullets to be made , more powerful shotguns/pistols , M-16 rifles , and so much more ! Also , each time you defeat Nemesis in the hard level , he gives you a peice to a gun you wo n't find in the game , or something cool like that . Then there is the Mercenaries game after you beat the actual game through the first time . Mercenaries is a little bit redundant , but if you keep at it , you can buy unlimited ammo , start with automatic weapons and more ! This means any gun you find in the game never runs dry , and believe me , the first time through the hard level , you 're going to WANT more ammo ! Besides , as you obtain more powerful weapons , you can swat Nemesis like a pesky fly with the missile launcher , mow down Zombies with the Magnum , or mass-attack with the mini gun.The story is pretty much & quot ; get outta Dodge & quot ; , but the added affects of meeting various survivors here and there is kind of cool ( although some of the survivors are not always the good guys ) . Also , each time you beat the game , you get another peice of what is happening with Leon , Claire , Barry , and more ! I 'd suggest this one , I played it for a solid month , even after I beat it ( and I 'm still playing ) !	1
This game is very ominous and scary . I love the capabilities the characters have , and the scenery is spooky . It was one of the last PSone games , so the graphics are advanced for that platform . You can definately see the improvements between Resident Evil and Resident Evil 3 : Nemesis . I love playing this on my PS2 , and I 'm not even getting the gamecube version of it because it 's exactly the same as this version .	1
This was the third and one of the hardest installement in the series . Esepcially on hard mode . Here are some tips on how to beat this game on hard mode based of a speed run release early this year or late last year . Try to put on infinite help . If seeing how fast you can do this get the shotgun as soon as powerful and use it at close range when neccessary when fighting multiple normal enemies . When attacked by nemissi run away as fast as you can since he is programm to eliminate all sureviving mebers of star a millitray defense force created to expose the illegal umbrela corporetations experiment . The main character is injected with a virus but do to a cermun called thew T cell whgich delays the zombie fication program she still has control over here self . Get the shooty gun . At the end of the game you can hurt nemesis and after turning the power of in the final before the city is nuked of the map you have a choice of finishing nemsis of permantely if you have cheats one or can hit him fromn a distance with the shoot guns or the freeze gas and other weapons that you can find or unlock or if you have enough herbs to restore your health before you die . Running more will get you through the game faster and quicker which you want on hard mode if you do n't have life super armoor or infinte shotgun shells or something like that . They do n't mention nemsis orgin as clear parts of this game were partly based on the second movie resident evil reserection . Nemesis does not turn on the scientist that experiment on him at the last minute allow Jill a few second head start before the helicopter is shoot down and explodes in the movie but she survives . If you ernjoy this try the super hard resiodent evil four or the diono cris games	1
For anyone who has not played this stellar game series , this is what you call a `` survival horror '' game , which means you have a gun , you are alone and you have 1000s of zombies , dogs , ravens , monsters and mutants after you . The third installment of the Resident Evil game series actually takes place before the second game , so you are writing the future , playing as the lead heroine Jill ( who survived the first game ) . You start out on the streets of Raccoon City , which has been ravaged by zombies , and you work your way to the Police Station and back into the city streets , trying to escape the town , all the while being stalked by a huge ugly killer which appears every once in a while to give the player a scare . Unlike the other two games , Jill is armed to the teeth right when you begin the game . She has a handgun , shotgun , magnum and an assault rifle , however unlike the original two games there are not waves of zombies to go through , instead there are only a few zombies , but the city streets are like a maze , so there is lots of ground to cover . There are only a few improvements made from the first two games . In Resident Evil 2 , there were only 4 types of zombies , with this game there are dozens of zombies , such as fat zombies , beautiful zombies and so on . There is also a new system where you can make bullets for certain guns , but there is no chance you will ever run out of ammo . Another nice addition is that the player can dodge attacks without the player 's help . The graphics and sound are still excellent , but several graphics were taken straight from Resident Evil 2 .	1
This game is extream fun and entertainment , let alone being an awesome game itself . I felt once again like I was taking part in an adrenaline pumping movie once again , only this time , with more killing than ever before . To write this review , I will split the game into three sections : what was good , what was bad , and what made me really love this game.Now I will list the goodies . Well , to start off , just look at it ; if you notice , the graphics are crisp and insanely detailed . If that were n't good enough , the cinematics are also incredibly intense and clear , and they tell the story rather well . What 's good about the cinematics however is that they are very well directed and carry the mood perfectly . The mood of this game is magnificant , it 's like a blend of fear , anger and depression all at once . The music supports these emotions , which is esspecially good when they focus on a single emotion . Also , the sound is great , another advancement over the sounds of the previous entry . I loved the voice acting and the new clicking sounds to the guns , as opposed to the old popping sounds of gunplay . The gameplay is almost perfect as now you can auto-aim at the zombies , but not make it super-fake looking like it was in the original.The plot though , like RE2 , is the backbone of the game . The characters in this game are well done and all play roles in the story . The story constantly increases the intensity as you are pitched up against bigger and badder dudes , esspecially Nemesis . The opening was awesome , and this game has one of the most emotional endings I have seen for the PSX ( not quite Final Fantasy level ) .However , there are setbacks to this awesome game , as I will now mention . I will have to state that the storyline was n't as gripping as in RE2 , nor as complicated with multiple scenarios . The cinematics , while the finest I have ever seen , are very short in length , so their overall effect is n't as high as I could have hoped . Also , after beating the game so many times , this game is now to me very easy for I know Nemesis ' weaknesses , and can easily exploit them ( email me for free tips ) . Also , the music is n't for the most part as good or scary or sad as in RE2 . However , some of the tunes at the very end are absolutely astounding and alone are worth purchasing the soundtrack ( well , I did just for those three tracks ) .Now , I will tell you my favorite aspect of this game , my reason for giving it a five star rating without any hesitation . The reason is that it satisfies my male cravings to kill and win . Nemesis follows you around so much that instead of getting annoyed , you get ... . He constantly lowers your overall ammo amount and forces you to use up healing items . As you fight him , you lust nothing more than to give Nemesis as much pain as you can give to him ; you want him to die a horrible death . In all the times you fight him , he passes out when you win , and that 's the end . Then , the second to last time you fight him , you can use acid faucets to melt parts of him away . You can take off his arms , and even his head . And the last time you fight him , you set up the puzzle , and while you wait , you can unleash whatever firepower you want on him ; there 's no passing out and allowing your escape , the last battle is a battle of REVENGE ! I loved that , and I think any player who likes thrilling and fun games would love this game too .	1
This one is set during the time when Claire and Leon are surviving the night in Raccoon City , now Jill Valentine resigns from S.T.A.R.S . and has to survive the city to try to escape but there are dangers waiting for her while she tries to escape such as Zombies , mutants and a brand new foe called `` Nemesis '' , she joins up with a renegade and his crew on trying to survive her latest nightmare.Most excellent third entry using tons of action you can control , puzzles to solve , and ways to survive . This is also very scary , not for those who are light sleepers but a must play .	1
I did have this game before and since I could n't get through a certain maze I sold it along with other games to get the new PS 2 at the time in which was only the box version . I wish I never did sell it because now one you play Resident Evil 1 & 2 . Your almost prompted to play the rest of the games of this series .	1
Let me just say that I have been a big fan of the series since the first one arrived on the playstation and this one does not disappoint . The game play is one of the most important parts in any game and this one is no exception and excels from the previous releases and adds new improvements to keep the game play from getting repetitive . The storyline is pretty good too but is mainly to expand the story of the events of resident evil 2 , though there is a side story so to speak of jill trying to escape the current situation that she is in which is also a welcome edition . The graphics are some of the best seen on the playstation and the best out of any of the four resident evil game releases on the ps1 , the sound is also good too . This is the first re game that never made it to the playstation greatest hits lineup , but do n't let that fool you because it is still a great game and a worthy edition to the series . I have only one minor complaint though , the game is a little shorter than re2 in which I would have enjoyed the game more if it was longer , even though it is short it is also sweet . For anyone who cant understand or is confused with the storyline Ill explain : The commandos ( one of many groups of rescue teams sent by umbrella ) were there officially to rescue survivors , unofficially though the leader was there to keep umbrella up to date of the current situation in raccoon city and collect battle data specifically from the nemesis fighting the remaining s.t.a.r.s members . Nemesis was basically an improved version of the tyrant type 2 that was in resident evil 2 in which the first tyrant originated from resident evil 1 , at this point in the game umbrella knew the current situation that was occurring in raccoon city via the leader of the commandos so the only option to cover up the incident in order to remain in business was to kill the remaining s.t.a.r.s members who held the only evidence linking this outbreak to umbrella , so they sent nemesis ( an improved version of the tyrant and/or tyrant type 3 ) to assassinate the remaining st.a.r.s members thus destroying any evidence linking umbrella to the incident happening in raccoon city . Unbeknown to umbrella chris had already escaped before the outbreak occurred ( as explained in re 2 when claire was surprised to not find chris in raccoon city , so if chris had any chance to take down umbrella he would have to not tell anyone when , where , or what he was going to do at that time ) . Eventually all of the main s.t.a.r.s members ( barry , chris , jill ) that escaped the mansion incident escaped raccoon city before it was destroyed . Eventually the remaining s.t.a.r.s members exposed umbrella putting them out of business , though people like wesker still exist to continue the work of umbrella for his own nefarious purpose . I am not really impressed with re 4 or from what I have played of re5 so far because they are just not as good as the re series used to be , this game on the other hand is a testament to the fact that you can still make vast improvements in the re series without sacrificing what made the re series so great in the first place . Sadly though I hardly recognize the re series today , it just went downhill since re4 was released because changes that were made negatively affected more than benefited the series imo . I just hope that capcom wakes up and brings the old school style resident evil flavor with improvements like re2 , re3 , and re : cvx did for the series in the future for the series .	1
what is this monster who runs faster than zombies and carries some times rocket like weapon and say stars all the time it is nemesis a powerful mutant now jill is back and you will meet new peoples such as carlos . the nicole is the bad guy if you want to kill him than in dead factory in the begin you will two live section like.1=push him off.2=jump off.if want wish nicole die than select push him off because nemesis will kill him.so horror game in the series of resident evil.including new hidous mutants a mr.touhg guy nemesis.matt the new movie of resident evil is the nemesis which is after stars members . he is not after jill he is after us because we are take control of jill . more horror than resident evil2 but no speaical features . but dont turn your volume off because will say stars and you will konw that he is after you .	1
I bought this game 2 weeks after it came out , and was I impressed , the game had great features like bringing Jill Valentine back the RE games.This had good monsters like the zombies , dogs , likers and Nemisis.The only thing I did not like was how Nemisis kept stalking you 24 seven but other than that this was a very good game .	1
This game is if im right the last Jill Valentine Adventure which makes me mad but this game is excellent . Ive beaten it 17 times and still like it . You get to kill infected zombies use cool weapons and lots of other neat junk . And when you beat the game you get a game called Mercenaries . And you get a key for new dresses . The Goal in the game is to kill Nemeses who is a guenie pig infected with the G-Virus not T. The T virus is the one that makes people zombies . You will team up with 3 of Umbrellas BioHazard Forces Mercenaries and kill everything and risk everything to escape Raccoon City . But on the way , one of your umbrella buddies admits he is a supervisor and trys to escape alone betraying you and your friends . But he dies and so does someone else . This game is so much fun but you have to find everything on your own you cant just goto a shop and ask for ammo cause everyone workin there are zombies . Youll love this game i just know yall will .	1
Resident Evil 3 : Nemesis adds a nice touch to the Resident Evil formula . Not only do you have to deal with oncoming hordes of zombies , but now you have another worry ... being chased by a Nemesis that will come after you no matter what you do to try and stop it . The addition of Nemesis made this game one of the most enjoyable , and my favorite of the Resident Evil\ 's . The addition to now be able to walk up stairs without pressing a button really did help way back when , though wondering how that was ever not a feature in the games is a bit of a puzzlement . And on the subject of puzzles , the only flaw this game has is the \ '' water puzzle\ '' near the end of the game . Only because it is totally random . Meaning you can get lucky and solve it in 20 seconds , or it could take about 30 minutes to beat . But other than that , this is a great game that any Resident Evil fan should have in their collection . NnyCW for CapCity .	1
This game kept me on the edge of my seat for days . I highly recommend . Gameplay is awesome , graphics are perfect and the bonus game at the end of the main game is worth playing through the whole thing more than once .	1
As I have mentioned before in my past reviews , I did not and will not buy Resident Evil 2 or Resident Evil 3 for Gamecube , I just do n't feel like they gave the fans what they could have given them . In the fact that Resident Evil Remake , for Gamecube , is far better than the original Resident Evil on PSX 1.That out of the way , let 's slip once again into the Survival Horror genre with Resident Evil 3 . To be flat-out-honest I loved this game from begining to end . Never once did I find myself annoyed or slowed down with any problems while playing this game . The graphics and sound are not much more than Resident Evil 2 gave us BUT the game itself seems to flow seemlessly with RE 2 in every aspect.I feel that Capcom hit the nail on the head with this game as they did with Resident Evil 2 ... heck thus far they have done a real bang up job making these games . In closing all I can tell you is that not trying Resident Evil 3 would be a mistake ... as the game has everything in it that you would need for a heartpounding experience of fun .	1
Resident Evil 3 ( 1999 ) . Capcom 's third installment of their famous survival horror series.When Capcom unleashed the original Resident Evil on the PSX back in the spring of 1996 , they had no idea that it would become one of their most successful franchises to date . In fact , the series is still going strong to this day with new games on the PS2 and Gamecube . So Capcom heeded the fans ' calls for a sequel , and released RE2 a couple years later . This game ended up being much greater than the original and won over many more gamers with its intense action and edgy suspense . After RE2 received much success , it would n't be long before another sequel would be in the works . Come the fall of 1999 , RE3 would make its appearance.The first thing most gamers will notice is that RE3 is n't intended to be a full blown sequel , but rather more of a side mission designed specifically for veterans of the first two games who thought they were two easy and wanted something more challenging . Plus it would buy time for the next real sequel , RE : Code Veronica . It 's quite clear that Capcom had this group of fans in mind when designing the third game . There are two difficulty settings , and although RE3 is n't intended for newbees of the series , the easy mode does give you plenty of ammo to survive most of the game without any problems . Hard mode , on the other hand , is VERY tough and it teaches you to conserve ammo and health items until they are absolutely needed . And even though it was always important to save the game in the past , it 's STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that you do it here , because it 's that tough . The action is certainly more challenging , and it offers a plethora of small improvements over the other games.The game 's only real downfall comes from the fact that the story is n't anywhere near as compelling as the other games , as it just takes place in the same time frame as RE2 . Well , specifically , the first half of the game starts a day before the events of RE2 and then the second half picks up several days after that game . Basically , the plot consists of Jill Valentine ( star of the first game , and thankfully NOT played by the same voice actress ! ) trying to escape the streets of the T-Virus infested Raccoon City , all the while avoiding getting killed by the Nemesis ( a crazed rocket wielding monster who 's out to kill STARS members ) . There 's nothing really surprising to the story , although Jill does encounter numerous mercenaries from Umbrella 's evacuation fighting squad . Carlos is the only one Jill spends the most time with and he resembles sort of a love interest for her . Capcom does n't really succeed as much with these two as say the relationship between Ada and Leon or the young girl Sherry 's affection towards Claire , both in the previous game . Still , there are multiple paths and different endings to achieve , so plenty of replayability is here . Thankfully , any fallacy of the story is more than made up for by the gameplay.If you 're already a fan of the action from the first two RE games , then you 'll love RE3 because there are a TON of additions to make the action segments more enjoyable . For instance , you can now dodge enemies attacks and utilize a quick turn so that running around is a lot easier to do . Plus , there are now interactive environmental items that you can fire at to cause damage to enemies . There 's nothing more satisfying than being chased by a group of 8 zombies and then suddenly taking them all out by firing a single shot at an explosive . BANG ! How cool is that ? BTW , zombies can now run after you and chase you up stairs , so watch out ! Another cool feature is the ability to create your own type of ammo by collecting and mixing different gunpowders . Even on hard mode , with the right combinations , you can end up with a LOT of heavy firepower.As for the graphics , sound , and music , they are all nearly identical , so read my comments on them in my RE2 review to get the synopsis . Same with the music , although I will comment on the effectiveness of the music when the Nemesis arrives . It 's quite scary when you leave the room that the Nemesis inhabits and then slow eerie music starts playing . You know that the Nemesis is nearby and will attack you at any time . This aspect was done very well.There 's only one playable character this time , but the game lasts at least 5-6 hours depending on how fast you go . Not to mention that items and monsters are randomly placed each time you play the game . RE3 does improve on the lack of challenging puzzles from the last game by featuring ones that have random outcomes each time . In fact , one puzzle toward the end of the game took nearly an hour to solve ! The scare factor is n't quite as high as in RE2 , but a new fear element is introduced and revolves almost entirely around the Nemesis when he 's chasing you . The first time I played the game , I thought that killing the Nemesis was impossible , but now I know that even on hard mode you can still best him if you use your resources properly . After the game is done , there 's still plenty of unlockable goodies to acquire , such as a timed battle mini game , different outfits , and numerous epilogues to explain the story further.Overall , if you 've mastered the first two games and hunger for more , then by all means pick up RE3 . It 's not perfect , but any older fan will find this game worthwhile . However , NEW FANS SHOULD START WITH THE OTHER GAMES FIRST BEFORE TACKLING ON THIS ONE , AS THEY MAY FIND RE3 TO BE FRUSTRATING . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED .	1
first let me get something off here . resident evil 2 was the best but that doesnt mean to not get this one too because this is an incredible game very fun lasts long enough to keep you entertained from begining to end . and then when you beat it you will unlock the mercenarieswhere you can unlock unlimited ammo for your guns and i think you can unlock infinite health too . making the game like a movie invinsible characters and they will never run out of ammo . the reason this game is not as good as resident evil 2 is that it doesnt have enough bosses or big enemies even though you do fight nemesis a lot and always wondor will he stay dead this time or do i got ta kill him again . its still better to have more bosses .	1
Resident evil is one of the longest run PlayStation titles out there . It is really a shame that Gamecube is the exclusive RE platform now , because Playstation always did it best . Since th very birth of PS , there has been resident evil , and RE 3 does not dissapoint . RE 3 puts a great new spin on the series , through the arch super villan nemesis . Nemesis ( as you can see from the box art ) is a menacing tyrant , much like the tyrants in RE 2 out for the lead character Jill 's blood . The great part about this game is the difficulty setting . While they really make no difference , it can give the new gamers to this title a bit more edge , since this is one of the harder RE titles.The thing that makes this game so adicttive to survival horror junkies like myself is the claustrophobic action , Throughout the game you have the idea in the back of your head that nemesis could be , and usually is , behind every corner . For some this good , for some this is bad . Some people enjoy walking through the city for hours and not having to worry about running themselves out of herbs and ammo every ten minutes . However , for most others it adds a great suspensful feeling to the game , and makes you feel more and more like your action do matter a great deal.As for the controls , no one will like them at first . It is sort of an acquired taste that most survival horror games have when ti comes to controls . Since all the camera angles are stationary ( it makes the game look better so do n't complain ) this game utilizes the up arrow as always being forward . Some people seem to understand it better if you explain as being an RC car , whether face south , north , east or west , up wil always drive you forward . There realyl is no way around this configuration , it really is best to dive right in and get used to it , even if it means being massacred five minutes in a bunch of times.In conclusion , I would not pick this RE in particular for anyone new to the series . With the inclusion of nemesis , you are required to make split second decisions , and it will often confuse , a nd ultimately lead to the death of more novice players . If you are new to the series , try RE 2 , RE 1 has a few problems present for newer players , but RE 2 is the perfect balance of horror , and simplicity . If your a veteran to RE , look no further for fun , just do n't expect it to be a cake walk !	1
When I got Resident Evil 3 , I could n't wait to play it ! First of all , it has the beautiful , talented , and smart Jill Valentine . She is a fighter all the way , she does n't need no man to protect her , and this game proves it ! It starts out with Jill trying to escape from the zombie-infested Raccoon City . She finds Brad Vickers , another from the first Resident Evil . He tell her that & quot ; he & quot ; is coming for STARS members , which got me interested.Later something happens to Brad , which I wo n't ruin for those who have n't played it yet , but when I saw & quot ; him & quot ; I was scared knowing he was after me . The best part is that he chases you through the whole game , popping up when you least expect it.Jill meets up with Carlos , who is completly pointless , except for a little part you have to control him . Other than that Jill is the superb heroine ! Proving women can defend themselves without men . I would recommend buying this game and loving every suspenseful moment . Play it in the dark !	1
Resident Evil 3 was a well done game , great detail , along with a good story add puzzles and zombies and a huge hard to stop monster `` Nemesis '' Scary Tone and music and you have one hell of a game . A worthy addition to add to your collection of games . Recommende to fans of Resident Evil .	1
If you envy Resident Evil : Code Veronica envy ? Do n't worry about it , although the Dreamcast has Resident Evil : Code Veronica with it 's flashy graphics and all , the game is n't due for quite some time I think . Although the PSX may not have DC 's graphical capabilities they are still not bad , considering the DC is 128 bit , and the PS is only 32 bit . RE3 has some of the best looking graphics the PSX has ever rendered . The FMVs are perfectly compressed and they look better than those found in Final Fantasy 8 . The game still uses pre-rendered backgrounds like all the other Resident Evils as if it was a ritual . The character detail is fantastically smooth and the main character Jill is very nicely detailed . She is complete with some of the finest looking skin touch ups any RE game has had . As for the frame rate , it always stays perfect and does n't drop at all.Although some people might say & quot ; been there shot that & quot ; to RE3 , they should still play it due to the new challenging puzzles the game has to offer . The weirdest thing in the game is that it 's more of a prequel than a sequel . The game takes place 24 hours before the 2nd Resident Evil . It starts out with zombies attacking RPD members and ends up with all of the RPD officers dead , while there are still tons of zombies on the loose . You will eventually meet up with Barry from the first RE too . Now for those of you who find the Resident Evil series a little too hard , you 'll be happy to know that when starting Resident Evil 3 and picking easy mode , you start out with an unlimited number of Ink Ribbons , and a hefty amount of ammo . You just have to get in the office room at the very beginning of the game . You will also come across some very familiar places in RE 3 . Like the RPD conference room in RE2 , and the RPD station it 's self . Believe me this is by far one of the finest moments of the PSX , and is the best Resident Evil game ever ( even better than Code Veronica for the DC ) . The game also features tons of dialogue , which most of takes place during an FMV sequence . Your main goal is to stop Nemesis who is basically the granddaddy of all the Zombies.The game has admirable voice acting to make the gaming experience feel better . It 's voice acting is usually done correctly being very precise and on time so do n't expect voice acting timing like in Silent Hill . You 'll experience some great sounding explosions , and the gun shots sound unbelievably real . If you turn up the volume and play with the volume set on very high , when a zombie pops out you will probably need a diaper change , but you will get retribution by blasting his head of and hearing the clarity of sound effects.Those of you who have played the first 2 games ( Director 's Cut excluded ) will already be very familiar with the controls . But those of you ( all three of you ) who have n't , will have a little difficulty with adjusting to the controls . Me on the other hand , I 'm a huge fan of the series and I know the basic layout . But do n't worry about it , you 'll have time to practice your controls in the beginning.Wrapping up this review I can say that Resident Evil 3 is not only the best of the series but it is also one of the best PSX titles out there today along with the top quality titles like Final Fantasy 8 , Tony Hawk 's Pro Skater and Syphon Filter.9.3 / 10	1
this game is very fun , plays quickly and offer a lot new features , wish it was longer though but the game is a little more difficult than the previous resident evils but still fun .	1
OK this game was great . The time line is very interesting in this game cause it takes place before and into the same time period of RE2 . The added feature of having the main boss chase you the entire game gives the game a interesting challege . Just when you get all relaxed and are on a roll killing zombies , the music changes and your hear STARS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! So now you have a very ugly mean disgusting ... ..thing chasing from room to room . Ne ways this game is great a definant must buy for any fan of the series . And a great game for beginners .	1
Well Well Well Here it goesThis game has a just amount of creepy and Scary cutscenes but still i lowered the volume and but the hell outta this game.It gives ya a fright and takes u to the Zombie Kick Ass Game NOt the number 1 resident evil game ( 2s better ) But it sure worth it to give you a fright	1
UNLIKE MANY OTHER CRITICAL GAMERS , I FOUND THIS TO BE ONE OF THE BETTER `` RESIDENT EVIL `` GAMES ! DO N'T GET ME WRONG - THE FIRST TWO ARE VERY GOOD , BUT THIS BLOWS THEM AWAY ! YOU GET WAY COOLER WEAPONS , YOU CAN MIX YOUR GUNPOWDER AMMO , AND FIGHT TONS OF AWESOME MONSTERS ! NOT TO MENTION `` NEMESIS `` ON YOUR TAIL ALL THROUGH THE GAME AS WELL .. EVEN THOUGH IT MAY SEEM A SHORTER GAME , AND NOT AN ACTUAL SEQUEL TO THE SECOND ONE ; IT STILL HAS ALL THE ELEMENTS YOU EXPECT FROM A `` RESIDENT EVIL `` GAME ..SO TURN OUT THE LIGHTS , TURN UP THE SOUND , AND PREPARE TO BE SCARED TO SHEER ENJOYMENT . AND A CLOSING WORD TO THE WISE , STEER CLEAR OF `` SURVIVOR `` ! ! IT IS HORRIBLE AND NOT WORTH THE MONEY ONE BIT ..AND PICK UP `` CODE VERONICA `` AS WELL . ANOTHER CLASSIC ONE IN THE SERIES ...	1
I got this game when it came out wich was around 1999 and 2000boy did this get me scared . Jill returns in the game to escape a hellish nightmare that was once raccon city . The game has a lot of twist and turns so it will keep you on the edge of your seat . I was up till 2am and still wanted to play . I managed to get it finished and over with in 3 days . The puzzle solvingwas a bit tough near the end . Nemisis was by far the best re creature ever made . Just the way of his figure and look made me love this game . The game is overall fun and a little chalenginga bit . Jill will need to kill solve and trust her way into escaping raccon city . I baught the game also on gamecube wich had no difference with this versian except that gc had a tad bit sharper graphics but that was because it was an import form the dreamcast versian so theres really no versian . I recommend any versian for this game cause there all good and theres nodifference . The cgI of the game was also the highest point of the game.So go out and get the game . Its the best in the series.I also recommend the remake for gamecube and zero . AND 2 of course .	1
this game is excillent , the graphics are top notch , the game is chalinging but not to hard , it is just a great game , why did I only give it 4 stars ? because the stupid voice acting , and why do the characters always move thair hands like that , do you know anyone who waves thair hands in slashing motions while they talk . If they would stop the hand movements and tried harder on the voices , the game would be perfict ! Do n't let the voices discurage you from buying this game , thair is so much to this game , let me talk about replay value , almost every puzzle in the game is random , so you ca n't just use the same solutions every time through the game . Let me talk about the nemesis , he 's a 8ft ( I think ) tall monster that makes frankenstein look like a whimp , with a tenticle that spews poison at you , and equipped with a cannon . He sounds dangerious , you face him more than wonce in this adventure . After much time playing this game you could tell capcom put much time in this enemy , and he has the only voice in the game that is not annoing , as he only says & quot ; stars & quot ; .	1
The final instalment of the series on Playstation 1 does n't disappoint . This is a classic game , an all time great . Although not as good as it 's two prequals , Res Evil 3 makes up for it with improved graphics and an amazing mercenaries game . The hard mode also offers the most difficult of challenges ever seen on the PS One . If you are a fan of the series then you MUST own this . Some gamers may feel it 's too easy iof they complete the game but try it on Hard Mode and then try the mercenaries and you get all the challenge you could ever ask for . The only reason why I 've given 4 stars instead of 5 is the basic fact , Res Evil 1 and 2 are both better . But do n't let that stop you buying it , this is a game that offers challenge , new enemies , harder puzzles and throws further into the series ' evil , intricate plot . A classic game .	1
The hardest puzzle of all ( NOOOO ! ! ! ) .You need to line up wave lengths A , B , and C so that when they pile up on topof each other , they cause the result to look just like the sample . [ These from Jesse Main ( slipknot_957 @ hotmail.com ) ] There 's 4 possible solutions:1 . A - 4 right . B - 2 right . C - 2 left.2 . A- 1 right . B - 1 right . C - 2 left.3 . A - 1 left . B - 2 left . C - 2 right.4 . A - 1 right . B - 3 right . C - 4 left.Even with the solutions , it still might take a little bit to do this . Irecommend writing down what you do , then if it does n't work , do it backwards toreturn it to its original position . Then , try another solution.This is for the Water Purification Puzzle towards the very end of the game . ( If you tried something diffrent and got it , please email me tstrong2999 @ aol.com )	1
wow what a game I got this game and I tell you this is a great game from up to up it doseit matter this a great game buy it i loved it dont buy the 1st one buy 2 and 3 thats all !	1
Dino Crisis was released way back in 1999 on the playstation . It was directed by the same director of the original Resident Evil . ( and producer of the next 2 ) It came out at the peak of survival horror popularity but was more than just a clone of Resident Evil . Obviously if you 're searching for this game 10 years later you must know something about it and the genre . This is probably a must buy if you like these types of games . I would say get Resident Evil 1,2,3 and Silent Hill first , however.Dino Crisis featured full 3D background , not prerendered ones like Resident Evil . It was much more advanced . You have a limited inventory but have different types of healing items and ammunition for each gun.And of course no zombies here ... oh no , Dinos ! Much faster than those old creepy zombies . The game environments were excellent and the music really added to the atmosphere . It 's definitely in the `` style '' of a late 90s Resident Evil game , which is a good thing.Some came with a Resident Evil 3 Demo , which was cool , and Resident Evil 3 of course came with a Dino Crisis Demo . Pick this one up !	1
I loved this game.I like the fact of killing smart and fast dinos alot more than killing stupid , retarded , slow and mindless zombies.It makes the game a little more challenging and this game has so many surprises going from raptors poping out from a corner to rip your face off all the way to a gient T-Rex busting through a window to bite you in half.I must say that this game is very gory but in a way still can not compare to the goryness of RE games.I bet though that your wondering why I called this one of the best survival-horrors when I have only givin it 4 stars instead of a perfect 5.Well , the game seems to have to much puzzle solving and not enough killing dinos.Like there is about a dino in every hall and in a few rooms but after you kill them all your stuck with about 50 puzzles to open a new area and then you finally get the opportunity to kill a few more dinos and then the same proccess over and over.50 puzzles,10 dinos,50 puzzles,10 dinos.But hey , look on the bright side.The graphics are very great , along with the sound and awesome FMV 's and the game also has its great and fun moments like when the T-Rex comes out.In this game the T-Rex plays a simmilar role such as the Nemises does in RE3 because they are both constant enemys that keep showing up to ruin your day and they seem invincable.This annoys some because of the same boss showing up over and over but I think its great ! ! Plus if you have played RE3 and got annoyed by the Nemises showing up over and over , you may like this a little better because in here the T-Rex does not show up as near asmany times as the Nemises does.Aside from the T-Rex and the Raptors there are 3 other deadly dinos.One is the small and very very annoying Compys , who show up and theres about 20 of them you gota kill which wastes a great deal of your ammo.Anouther is the flying bird dinos ( I dont know how to spell there names ) and last but not the least , these very very strong and very big ( bigger than a raptor anyways but way smaller than the T-Rex ) wierd looking things that I do not have a clue to what there names are.Oh , now I would like to get to the ammo.Ammo is very very hard to find in this game , and there is not even that much to find ... But I suggest to you to get and infit ammo cheat because you 'll need it for this game.This games AI ( artificial intellagence ) is very good.The dinos are smart and if you are bleeding they can smell it all the way from a different hall and start stalking you.So over all this is a great horror-survival that has ( somwhat little ) but good action none the less.Buy it , you 'll love it ( exept if your not good at solving puzzles ) .bye now .	1
An awsome game ! The graphics are amazing , and what I found most impressive about this wonderful survival horror game is the fact that even the gameplay itself is like watching a movie . Just seeing Regina walk down a darkened cellar as things that tear and claw human flesh are active about , is an impressive cinamatic event and almost an FMW sequence within itself . The gameplay is fun , but at times a little frustrating , but almost every game is a little frustrating . A lot of gore , and although I 'm not into gore too much , I still thought that this game was an awsome event , and it 's something that you do n't wan na miss out on . It 's games like dino crisis which show off the wonderful and moneys worth of a playstation one , even if the system is considered a little outdated , which I do n't think is true at all , since I believe that Playstation is still worth playing . Get the game , it is so incredibly fun that it is unbelievable .	1
This game is n't historically important ( in the history of videogames ) , it 's derivitive , and flawed , but I still had a lot of fun playing it . It 's like a good b-movie . I tend not to like the graphics of playstation games , I preferred the snes back in the day , but here they work . The graphics lean towards realism but have a hint of anime influence , and I think they did a really great job on the dinosaur models , and most of the animations are pretty expressive , the limping of Regina when she 's injured for example . The grainyness of the graphics enhance the b-movie feel . The voice acting is n't great but each character has a distinct personality . I also enjoyed the item mixing system , this allows you to customize the difficulty of the game , you can choose to use weak items or level+ items . There is also a decent amount of strategy in the game depending on the kind of weapon you use : raptors will be unfazed , stunned , or knocked down depending on the strength of the weapon ; and there are also laser shields in some areas you can use to knock down raptors in order to run from them.Flaws : the first and most serious flaw in the game is that the areas on the map are n't labeled , this is idiotic , it means that when you find clues with room specific information then , unless you have a great memory , you wo n't know where to look . Another problem is that sometimes important objects in the environment will blend in with the background and look unimportant , there is a key slot that would have taken me hours to find if I did n't get annoyed and look at a game walkthough . Sometimes the camera angles can hide important objects too . There is also a problem with damage detection and hit point arithmetic : a raptor wo n't take damage during some parts of it 's animation , and if you get in some shot gun blasts then switch to the hand gun sometimes it wo n't count the damage done with the shotgun , both of these issues waste bullets . You ca n't group items how you want , sometimes you 'll want to upgrade just one item but are forced to waste two others because of auto grouping . The select sound effect gets annoying considering how often you have to go to your inventory . The save system is slow and annoying . The pace of the game gets stalled from puzzles sometimes , you 'll be running for your life but then have to stop and do a puzzle , and I never figured out the rules of the crane puzzle it just felt like trial and error .	1
I remember back in 1999 when I received Dino Crisis as a Christmas present . This was my first exposure to a survival horror game . Believe it or not , I actually did n't bother with the Resident Evil series until six years later , in the summer of 2005 , which is when I played Resident Evil 2 for the very first time.Now , let 's go back to 1999 for a moment . The world of 3D gaming was in full swing at that point in time . 1999 was a year when people were anxiously awaiting what the Playstation 2 would give us , while at the same time , we were appreciating what the original Playstation was offering . The original Playstation , as you may already know , is where the survival horror genre *really* became popular . Resident Evil , Silent Hill , and , the now underrated and unfortunately forgotten , Dino Crisis series.Over time , people have n't treated the Dino Crisis series with *nearly* as much respect as the Resident Evil and Silent Hill series . It probably has something to do with Dino Crisis 3 being a really bad game with horrible camera angles , which meant , after that failed experiment hit the market , people were n't interested in any more Dino Crisis games . But , you know , even before Dino Crisis 3 was released , people did n't respect the Dino Crisis series as much as the other survival horror games . I really have no idea why . Dinosaurs can be *just* as cool as zombies . Believe me . Perhaps it has something to do with the animation ? Even though killing dinosaurs is fun and addicting , Capcom made killing zombies slightly more interesting , thanks mainly to better animation from pointing and shooting your guns at a zombies head . It just looks and feels better in Resident Evil . This in NO WAY should be reason to avoid Dino Crisis . This also does n't mean Dino Crisis is flawed in the shooting department . Both Resident Evil and Dino Crisis offer tons of enjoyment . TONS of enjoyment . They are just separate beasts.The original Dino Crisis is supposed to be about making the right decisions when it comes to either keeping your ammo and health in one place , or making the decision to bring the ammo and health with you . It 's supposed to be about guessing whether or not the ammo or health will eventually be necessary as you progress through the game . However , on easy mode , none of this makes a difference . The game is *so* easy on easy mode , that you can literally get attacked by dinosaurs about five or six times before you even need one of those Med Pack M 's ( used to bring your health back to 100 % ) . Seeing as how there are n't many dinosaurs in the game overall , you will only need to use one of these health packs maybe two or three times throughout the entire game . Dino Crisis is *that* easy ! This means you will only have to bring one or two Med Packs with you , and leave the rest behind.To be fair , you ca n't just mindlessly shoot every dinosaur you arrive to , because you are n't given a whole lot of ammo . Certainly not as much ammo is given to you compared to how many health packs are available throughout the journey . Despite that , running out of bullets probably wo n't ever be a problem . Just make certain you avoid some of the weaker dinosaurs in the early parts of the game . That way you will have enough bullets for the bigger and deadlier dinosaurs in the later parts of the game ( which obviously require more bullets to kill ) .You are given the ability to mix things together , to create dangerous darts . These darts are used to kill dinosaurs *very* quickly , sometimes in a single shot . The problem here is that , on easy mode , the game is so simple that mixing darts together is n't even important . You do n't have to worry about dart-mixing on easy mode *at all* . You can simply shoot or avoid all the dinosaurs you come across on easy mode and not have to worry about dart-mixing EVER . That kind of ruins the whole `` survival horror '' aspect of the game . You should have been required to use at least one or two of these darts.People criticize Dino Crisis 2 for being just a mindless shooting game where you have to kill as many dinosaurs as possible to progress to the next area and collect bigger guns , but the honest truth is , the original is a MUCH easier game overall because you can simply run past all the dinosaurs that stand in your way . You ca n't do that in the second game . You have to stand up to them and shoot . So Dino Crisis 2 is a harder game , in my opinion . Oh sure , you are given an option to up the difficulty ( in both Dino Crisis games ) but the problem here is that the difficulty goes up SIGNIFICANTLY , making the game nearly impossible.Another problem I have with the game is the amount of cutscenes . You CAN NOT skip over them , so you are forced to watch almost every single one of them . Most of them are kind of boring because most of the cutscenes feature the main characters just talking to each other . Sometimes you will see a cool-looking dinosaur attacking something , though . But Capcom *really* should have given you an option to skip over the cutscenes like they did in the sequel , because most of them are flat-out boring . These conversations are supposed to create a spooky mood , but it does n't work in my opinion.I also have a problem with the INCREDIBLE amount of puzzles you come across . I am not kidding , there 's over 25 puzzles in this game . Some of them are just a matter of typing in the correct series of numbers , or the correct words to access the next area . Some of the puzzles are more along the lines of finding the right way to complete them , such as the puzzle where you 're pushing these Up , Down , Left and Right buttons to figure out how to sucessfully lift up and put down boxes using a giant crane . These are extremely hard puzzles to figure out by yourself unless you have a walkthrough . Once you figure them out , the sequence is exactly the same the next time you play the game , though . They 're not random like in Resident Evil 3.The game is also *very* heavy on searching for the correct key cards to gain access to the next part of the game , which can be annoying . Simply put , the game is dominated with puzzles and key cards , which are always required to access the next area . A bit much , to say the least.Despite the above problems , Dino Crisis is STILL a pretty fun game because the dinosaurs are animated beautifully and the graphics as a whole are really good for 1999 as well . The actual gameplay has some problems mentioned above , but there 's also plenty of action to be found . Also , the game is pretty scary and intense , and the dinosaurs are simply wonderful looking and it 's interesting the way they can attack you because they attack differently each time . Sometimes they will bite at your arm , other times they will pick you up from off the ground , and more.Oh , and the music and sound effects are amazing . Perhaps the best music and sound effects in a survival horror game ever . Instead of featuring melodic themes , you are treated to sound effects and musical notes that seem to play randomly , almost making it sound like improvised music , like something from a King Crimson record . This means , if you listen to the music carefully , you can hear a bunch of unusual and creepy sound effects in the background . You hear something different each time . It 's awesome , and works great . It 's not a typical soundtrack in any shape or form , even by survival horror standards . It 's so good.Overall , even though Dino Crisis has almost zero replay value , and too much time is spent running around inside a facility doing one puzzle after another ( and collecting one key card after another ) the game is worth the experience . It 's not a classic , just a nice game .	1
Dino Crisis is a great game -- lots of excitement , suspense , and action . It does n't fail there . I beat it in four days ( seven hours playing time ) , though , so definitely rent it first.Some of the voice acting is weak , but it 's not the worst out there . The story will keep you interested , as will the battles with the enemy dinosaurs . An added plus is the decisions you must make at key points in the story , but even this ( and the different costumes ) is n't enough to give the game the replay value it needs to make it a 5-star game .	1
You can say this is resident evil with dinosaurs but it 's a little more than that . Definitely scary . Puzzles are a little complex and tricky . You 'll need a pen and paper to figure them out . Cutscenes are awesome . Monsters are quick here . You no longer have the comfort of running away from a slow moving zombie . Certainly challenging . Four stars overall because this game is short , but still worth it.I did play Dino Crises 2 and it was okay . More of a shooter . Wished Capcom stayed with the survival horror element . They had a winner here .	1
remember playing this as a kid	1
If ya likie dinosaurs , you will like this game . If you enjoy survivor horror games this is a good one to play.Keeps you going and the story line is good .	1
As my first forray into the world of survival horror , I was very curious to see how this game would hold up in this age of Playstation 2s and Halo . I am pleased to say that this is a pretty fun game that has its strenghts and weaknesses.You play as a secret agent named Regina . Your mission is to infiltrate Ibis island to find a mysterious scientest named Dr. Kirk . Upon landing on the island , it quickly becomes obvious that there is something very wrong with the island . Then it becomes a quest to survive the evil reptillian menace.Many , many people have complained about how dino crisis should be called puzzle crisis . It is true that there is an unusual amount of puzzles in the game that you must solve to advance . They range from simple ( switch the batteries ) to the moderatly difficult ( move the crates with a crane ) to the quite difficult ( Rotate electronic chips to divert power ) . There are also a mamoth amount of keys that you must get ( Around 50 ) . There are also DDK locks that you have to dechiper to unlock doors ( Hence the title of this review ) . Most of these puzzles can be solved moderatly easily , if you really think about it . Overall , I 'd say that the game is a 50/50 mix of puzzles and dinosaur action.As for the fighting part of the game , you get a total of three weapons , ( Shotgun , handgun , and grenade gun ) to exterminate raptors , pteradons , etc . Some people might be turned off at the idea of only 3 weapons , but I dont find it a problem . Combat is handled in the RE control scheme , which works pretty well . As with a lot of survival horror games , you have to be carefull as to how you make your way through with ammo , which is not unlimited ( Except in 1 case ) . Fighting the dinosaurs can be difficult , but mastered . Overall , I 'd give the combat a BThere are some things to really like about Dino Crisis . At certian points during the game , you have to make decisions aka `` Choose your own adventure '' style ( Do you investigate the underground area , or go save a comrade ? ) . This adds a nice touch of replay value . The graphics are pretty good ( By PS1 standards ) . The best part of the game however , is the T-rex . The T-rex provides the most exciting elements in the game , and each encounter is a adrenaline charged rush . Likewise , the 4 possible different endings are all very exciting and cool to play through , although there are a few things I am curious about . For example , ( Spoiler ! ! ! ) how can a T-rex swim 30 miles an hour in water ? That dosent make much sense . ( End Spoiler ) The weak points of the game are mostly the puzzles . There are a bit too many of them , and not enough dino battles . Also , the devlopers throw puzzles at you when you least suspect it , and when you dont want them . While racing to a heliport for example , a big race against time with tense dramatic music , the game tosses a box pushing puzzle that you have to solve to advance . Another time , you have to solve 2 big puzzles in the span of 10 minnutes , where you have to power an elevator , then move cranes when they are only 3 minnutes apart . Also , the unlockable mini-game you earn if you beat the game in under 5 hours , is dissapointing ( At least to me ) . The element of strategy is unwelcome , I just want to blast dinosaurs , and not worry about ammo , and Why isint the T-rex included ? overall , I think that Dino Crisis is a fun game , and a good start to the world of Survival horror . I recomend picking it up if you find it for uner $ $ $ .The good : good graphicsgood dino actiongood storyChoose your own adventure style branchesThe T-rex4 cool endingsThe not so good : a bit too many puzzlessome really difficult puzzlesnot enough dino actionmediocre mini game ( See above )	1
Makers of RE bring us : Dino Crisis The graphics , musick , backgrounds do look pretty good ! You play a redhead babe Regina and have to blast your way through all these blood thirsty dinos.. It gets hard at times , but after you play it a few times , you 'll be all set.. This also has decent replay value as well , you get more costumes , and an infinite grenade launcher , so you can play again and blast all dinos Regina 's other costumes are really cute as well , especially the cave-girl one , and she looks yummy ! What else can I say ? DC is worthy of purchase although it 's somewhat on the mediocre side . RE fans will like ...	1
Let me give it to you really short and sweet ! Did you like Resident Evil ? Then you will like Dino Crisis ; it 's Resident Evil with dinosaurs . All Capcom did was change the characters and instead of shooting zombies you get to shoot and kill raptors and other dinosaurs that are trying to eat you.I myself am a fan of Resident Evil so for the price this is a cool game . The same problems from RE come with Dino Crisis however ... . lack of ammo ! ! Besides this it 's a fun game , lots of puzzles to figure out and lots of shoot first ask questions later type of fun .	1
While some reviews hail this as a Resident Evil with Dinosaurs it 's much more than that . The characters were great , and the story line is awesome . The only complaints I had for this game were the camera angles , some were very infuriating ! The game play is solid , and this game is an instant classic . I would recommend picking this game up at the cheap price it is being sold for before it 's too late ! Fast shipper as well , and prompt service !	1
Steven Spielberg proved that Dinosaurs could be menacing and terrorizing and this game only adds to it . This game is similar to Resident Evil ( also from Capcom ) , but more dangerous , because the dinosaurs actually run and jump over things to eat you , unlike sluggish zombies . Rather than stalking screen to screen like with Resident Evil , you can now run through a room and the camera will follow you , making for great chases ( Dinosaurs chasing you ) , but unfortunately this leaves the player at a great disadvantage , because the camera is focused on the player , not the room , so Dinosaurs constantly get the edge lunging onto the screen . A huge plus to the game is the production , because hard work went into making this game and story excellent . The cinematic scenes to start with are of a higher quality and are very detailed , from breezing hair , brushing plant life to seeing the scales on a dinosaur . The dialog is not cheesy or over acted as in other survival horror games . There are nice visual details which no screen shot can show , such as the lighting effects are realistic , a light sources ( computer screens , ceiling lights ) illuminate on whatever the source hits . An unfortunate detail of this game is that whether you are bitten , clawed or pounced on , you can actually bleed to death without proper medical supplies . Another downfall of the game is that the item screen is not as neat and tidy as Resident Evil 's screen . This new system is rather difficult to use . Finally , with the start screen there is no cinematic introduction that will tip anything in the game to the player .	1
The graphics are well done . The game play is pretty easy . The mix of shoot em ' up and thinking man puzzle play is great . It took me awhile to get through the first 1/2 hour without getting my butt whooped , but once I got the hang of everything it became very enjoyable.They were n't joking about the realistic violence and gore . Watch out if you 're at all squeamish . It also has a couple of different endings depending on how you play the game , so it has a lasting appeal to it.I recommend .	1

Having played a rather large number of survival horror titles in my time , I uncovered this title at the local flea market for 3 bucks . Having missed it back on the ps1 days ( I was too busy with Silent Hill and Resident Evil I guess ... ) and being a die hard fan of Survival Horror , I picked it up . First and for most , many people have claimed this to be Rresident Evil with dinosaurs . Do n't get me wrong , the similarities are hard to miss , but this really is something unique . Enimies are fast ... the slow moving zombie has been replaced with the screeching , agile , adreniline fueled velociraptor ... Which makes this game pretty difficult . No , think about it . RE controlls ... only with zombies that move faster than you . Get the picture ? While this does ramp the difficulty significantly , it is n't too over bearing ( You just have to learn that blasting dinos is n't a good idea and running away is ) . Despite the more frentic combat , the game still moves at a sluggish pace that survival horror players have either come to love or hate . This is due in large part to a vast number of puzzles ( which make little sense , as usual ... colored key cards , statues , crate moving , etc . ) and back tracking , in true RE fashion . However , this game offers some really chilling atmosphere , and despite the slow moving speed , it really does feel faster and more frentic than it 's compitition , just because dinos are everywhere , you are always running and usually have an extremely low ammount of ammo at all times . Because nearly every area has key items , you have to explore . Because these same areas feature dinos , you have to use ammo to kill them . Because dinos are so fast and hard to kill you are always taking damage . You use healing items to cure wounds , so there for , unlike Resident Evil , it is pretty damn hard to hoard ammo and healers ... all this results from fast moving enemies , and because you almost always just barely escape every situation by the seat of your pants , this gives dino crisis an exciting edge that most other horror games still have n't perfected . Add to this , `` choose your own adventure '' style twists in the plot where you call the shots as to which direction the story goes , the ability to combine items to create more powerful weapons , new types of ammo , and more potent healing items , and some pretty nifty graphics ( they really are n't that bad , considering this game is almost 5 years old ) and you have a winning title . As for the not-so-juicy parts , well ... there are only about 4 types of enemies . And if you ever saw Jurassic Park or opened up a childrens Dinosaur book , you already know what they look like and how they will act . I 'm not complaining , because each dino still scares the crap out of you when it pops out of a vent shaft or chases you down a corridor at high speed ... but they lack that what-the-hell-is-it ? factor of the mutants seen in RE and Silent Hill ... Before you ever encounter them , you already know exactly what the enemies will look like , and how they will try and kill you . It just is n't as disturbing as the freekish encounters experienced in most other games of the genre . More so , the weapon selection is a little limited ( 3 weapons : Pistol , Shotgun , Grenade Gun ) , which offer a nice balance of speed , ammo availability and power ... but it still leaves something to be desired , as pistol ammo is far too week to be useful ( 7 to 10 hits for a kill on a fast moving enemy ... yeah right ) and shotgun ammo is far to scarce to be wasted on anything but important circumstances ( obviously grenades are saved exclusively for bosses if you actually want to beat the game ) . A good middle ground weapon would have been nice , just to lower frustration and make combat more stream-lined . In short , if you never liked Survival Horror , this is n't going to turn you into a fan . But if you like the corridor romping , the solving of mundane puzzles that pop out of no where and a few heart pounding marrathon runs while being chased by savage lizards , this is a game you should check out . Dated by today 's standerds , but still decient enough to replay to see the 4 different endings . I give it a solid 85 out of 100 .	1
it would be unfair to pass this game by as another resident evil rip off because , although the basic premise is the same it is actually a very different game in every respect . And with the exception of 2 , dino crisis easily excels any of the resident back catalogue.The graphics are very good and use a different technique than RE allowing for much more user interaction . In RE the graphics are made up of pre-rendered backgrounds but DC uses polygonal characters and backgrounds to better effect and look very much like the areas they are trying to convey . This style of graphics works better than in RE and heightens the tension very well.The gameplay is more innovative than in the RE games with more puzzles and less emphasis placed on action . DC 's weapons are reasonably feeble compared to those in RE but this works for the better . Instead of just splattering every enemy you come across you need to think of alternatives as shooting everything will soon either get you killed or make you run out of ammo fast . Throughout the game you have to use security fences to your advantage , running past a raptor when its back is turned , past a sensor and then turn on the fence , much better than just killing the raptor and more satisfying to boot.Enemies are also more intelligent than in RE games , as they would need to be , and will chase you through doors and follow your trail of blood . They are all also more agile than those in RE and so those encounters you can not avoid are made even more visceral.The use of puzzles through the game is also well done and some are real brainteasers , they are also more inventive than in RE , such as finding the right combination of gases for a poisoned room to gain entry or searching corpses for fingerprints to make a keycard . Much better than RE 's simple need key , find key approach.The enemies in the game is where it starts to slip a bit with not too many variations in there but this isnt much of a problem as dino encounters are not all that frequent anyway . The way the dinos are presented to you is good and the ways you are encouraged to beat them is refreshing . such as guiding a pterodactyl into a fan or electrocuting a raptor.The main boss , although it hd to be a T-Rex , is better a good alternative to the tyrants in the RE series and provides a constant menace much like in RE3 and always seems to be breathing down your neck . Even when you think youre safe he bursts through a window or finds some way of spoiling your day.The longevity of the game is pretty much what you expect of a game of this type , a fast play through can take approximately 3 hours but the first time took me about 5 1/2.The game length did surprise me though as at one point i was sure that i had finished the game but i was only half way through.There is significant replay value in the game with three endings and many different costumes to be unlocked and with the game made in such a way you can play through and experience it differently each time.Overall there is not much to gripe about with this game and i really can not find much fault with it at all . Although the game length is expected with this sort of game it can seem annoying to others for it to be over so fast but with MGS the game is so enjoyable that this isnt a problem . Also hardcore blasters may complain about the puzzle orientated gameplay but if you ask me its far better this way.i 'd give it a 95 %	1

I am basically buying and beating old playstation games I never got a chance to beat . I just finished this game today and it was pretty good . The controls are prettymuch identical to the early resident evil series and so is gameplay really . The story is pretty decent the only things I did not like about the game is it can become tedious running and back and fourth and some of the puzzles , not hard , are just kind of annoying . Good pickup if you can find it for under 10 bucks and looking to waste a saturday with a 6 pack . Game should take no more than 8 hours and thats really pushing it	1
This game is fun , do n't get me wrong , but the problem is that this game offers nothing new to the style of game created by Capcom 's own Resident Evil series . Basically its the same story you 're trapped on an island where dinosaur research has run amuck and your goal is the escape before getting devoured by the many dinosaurs you 'll run accross while playing this game . ALong the way you 'll have to also solve some puzzles to be able to escape the island . So basically if you enjoyed Resident Evil or any of its clones , Dino Crisis is a game for you .	1
Around 1999 this game hit shelves on the coat tails of the success of the famed Resident Evil series . It even comes with a demo for Resident Evil 3 Nemesis ! That said , this is not Resident Evil . It has similar controls and a story a little too silly to understand , but that is it.The game is dependant on your ability to craft darts or find bullets to kill the enemys of the game . You will never have enough ammo to march through the compound and kill every enemy . You will need to run , close doors , operate lazer gates , and ect to get through this game.There are puzzles as well , none that I can immediately remember except for the puzzle where you move cargo holds to make a path.The enemies are excellent . This game has dinosaurs that look and feel like Jurrasic Park dinosaurs . The raptors are vicious and terrifying , the pterradactyles are a situational enemy but they are a thrilling challenge , the dome-headed dinosaurs show up and kick your can , and the Tyrannosaurus Rex is simply great . The enemys are so well used in the game that they are completely plausable . They take a great deal of damage and are fast and strong enough to rip you apart.I give this game praise for going away from the zombie threat and replacing them with something exceedingly more violent and threatening . I love zombie games more than the next guy , but this was just good . The story was B-Movie , just like in Resident Evil , and the enemys were terrifying and threatening . The enviroments were dynamic and look really good on PS1 . Very little did not work in the game , and if ther was something then I can not remember it .	1
Capcom did an excellant job on this game . besides your gay comrade Rick who is completly useless . ( and gay , no really i think he is gay ) mainly because of his cheesy jokes and his weird apperance . oh and then theres Gail who strangely resembles Nicholai from RE3 . which is also a good game . but any how onto Dino Crisis , the game has an excellant plot and a very hot protagonist named Regina . ( where would Capcom be without a hot Girl ) the voice acting is very good compared to Resident evil 1 ( Jill Sandwhich ) And survivor ( the phone hang up ) the charcters were dedecated to their voice acting . ( surprise ! ) usually capcom screwd that up . the controls were easy to navigate and to remember also they were responsive . the gaphics were great for a PS1 game . the velociraptors had decent AI for the time all except the random red forcefields that some of them were trapped behind . They run into it . which is hilarious to watch . you 'll see what i mean if you play it . the puzzles are not to hard unlike RE3 Water treatment puzzle . God help if u dont know the motive to the puzzle . the puzzles in DC are easy to figure out . and are not frustrating . all three weapons were useful in their own way . for example when fighting the T Rex . lord help you if u dont have any grenade rounds . after that you are pretty screwd . the camara angles were n't all that bad . the auto lock on is required . dont ask it just is . Over all a great game . a must buy for capcom fans . Hint steer clear of DC3 . DC2 is also very good . happy dino hunting .	1
I have a PS2 now , but this wuz my 1st PS1 game along with Crash Warped ( 5 stars ) , Buzz Lightyear ( 1 star ) , and that 's all I remember . But even with the PS2 , this game never ends and never gets boring ( except the outer space levels and I recommend it even though it 's for PS1 , especially at the cheap price it 's sellin ' fo ' .	1
The yellow dot that eats lots of other , smaller dots debuts in his first 3D platforming adventure . The controls are nice and friendly , the visuals are pretty , and the gameplay is more than just a bunch of jumping and bopping enemies . The original Pac-man arcade game is included as well for posterity 's sake . Original ideas and interesting uses of classic material from Pac 's past are integrated in a nearly perfect meld of old and new in this title , which went on to inspire a Mario-esque series and spinoffs that lasted to the end of the following console generation . Great for the whole family . Runs on Playstation 1-3 .	1
This product is excellent and works very well , i recommended to buy it and have fun with it . Its very good	1
To be frank , this is what got me hooked on Pac-Man . After I tried the original Mrs. Pac-Man , I wondered about the other version . I 'd heard good things about it , and that it was a very good game , but I was n't so sure . Then I tried my cousin 's Game Boy version of it and I loved it too . Pretty soon , I had forgot in favor of my now favorite video game series , Crash Bandicoot . Then , we went game shopping in Toys R Us , and I saw it . The 1st thing that popped into my mind was , `` That 's a Cool Looking Pac-Man . '' Since mny dad had said no more Crash games for a bit , I asked him for this . I loved Pac-Man World 's graphics , game play , controls , worlds , and the challenge . I was hooked.The storyline is quite simple . It 's Pac-Man 's 20th anniversary , and the Pac family is gearing up for it . They 're preparing a big party , but suddenly , guess who shows up and kidnaps them ? That 's right the Ghosts . Their new boss , Toc-Man wants to replace the `` Pac '' in all the titles of Pac-Man 's games with `` Toc '' , thereby making himself the star of the series . So , Pac-Man must rescue his family.I recommend this game .	1
Being a 90s kid , this was a must-have for me and I LOVED this game . Unfortunately , I lost the disc several years ago and have been without it since , until recently when I purchased a copy from Amazon . This is undoubtedly the best game I have ever seen , especially for PS1 , since most of those games are quick and easy . Quite the opposite with this game . I 've only gotten halfway through it because the bosses are SO hard . Try playing Anubis Rex and/or Space Galaxian and you 'll see what I 'm talking about . This game may have been released for other game systems , but none retains the quality and feel that the PS1 version does . ( By the way , if you buy this game , Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness is the perfect complement to this one . It is also quite complex for a PS1 game . ) Yes , there still are new Pac-Man video games being produced all the time ( recently , Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures ) , but none have the feel of this one .	1
This is the most fun game that I have ever played for the playstation . It has so many grets features , which I will explain.Examples of animations and corresponding sounds : -Cannons ( pirate Levels ) -Lava ( ruins levels ) -Lazers ( space levels ) -Spinning discs , mirrors ( funhouse levels ) -Falling objects ( factory levels ) -Floating coffins ( ghost levels ) Of course there are others that are in every level , like enemies and ghosts . This game is filled with excellent graphics too . They are excellent for the age of the game , and are very diverse . I love the variety of the levels too . None of them are boring or anything like that . All just excellent . There are enemies at the end of the group of each level . Some are easy , some are very very hard . King Galaxian and Anubis Rex are some hard levels . But they are possible to beat , just keep trying . Nothing is wrong with a challenge . The background music chosen is great as well , very suitable for the level . The sound effects are great . There are so many of them . I highly recommend this game , I 've been playing for years and still enjoy it . Even in this day and age it is a good idea to buy it .	1
Pac-Man World is a great game for Playstation and Playstation 2 owners . You get 3 modes of play including the original Pac-man game , as well as a 3-D adventure mode , and a 3-D over the top Dot munching game . All 3 are very fun to play , which makes this game a very good value.Recommended for those looking for a cheap , fun game , for their PSone or PS2 .	1
Many , many 80 's icons of video gaming have tried to make the leap to 3D platformers . Most have failed . Though credit is due to Frogger , who keeps on trying . Keep it up , buddy , you 'll get there yet . But outside of the Mario franchise , few pixelated critters have the staying power to stay relavant in todays gaming world . Anyone else waiting for Super Q bert Land ? One of the limited exceptions to this rule has been Pac-Man . The worlds first video game character ( not counting faceless space ships and tanks ) , he beat Mario to the sidescroller in Pac-Land , and stared in two adventure games of his own in the SNES days , Pac-Man 2 the New Adventures and Pac in Time . So when the gaming world went 3D in the late 1990's/early 2000 's he was primed and ready to make the switch as well.The great thing about the first Pac-Man World is that the developers were able to mix new style game play in with classic elements to create a game that new players and seasoned pros alike could enjoy . The multiple new mazes playable feel like a blast from the past , while the platforming levels that make up the bulk of the game explored what was then new ground in a consistantly entertaining way . The game established moves for Pac-Man that would carry over into two enjoyable sequels and featured plenty of old favorites like pac-dots , fruit , and those pesky ghosts in new and exciting settings . It also established Pinky as female , before all ghosts were assumed to be guys . ( Except for Sue , of course . ) Now , if you 're only familiar with modern kid-friendly games you might be surprised by the difficulty of this game . Some of the bosses are maddingly hard to defeat , and the amusement park level will make you want to renounce power pellets and stick to zombie hunting . But if you enjoy a challange this can actually be a plus . If not , the Gameboy Advance version plays surprisingly well and does n't have most of the boss levels.While not my favorite of the & # 34 ; World & # 34 ; trilogy , this was a great continuation of a classic series . Here 's hoping that future Pac-games will recapture the magic of this entry .	1
I 've reviewed the later-released Game Boy Advance version of this game a while back , but this is THE real deal . I may have recommended the other version , but this original is infinitely better , making the other one look like crap . My Playstation library certainly is n't big , but I know for a fact that you need this game ! First off , the presentation is top-notch . You are treated to a couple 3D-animated FMV cutscenes . And then , BAM ! As soon as the level begins , you wander at the amazingly colorful graphics , catchy lighthearted music , and as you start playing , the gameplay will get you hooked.The gameplay is somewhat basic . You can run , jump , Rev Roll ( Like Sonic 2 's spin dash move ) , and throw the Pac-Dots you eat to create small explosions . Fortunately , it actually makes for a very fun time , especially as you progress through the levels . There are lots of tweaks in each level , filling things up with neat detail and differentiation . It could be a little hard to judge distance for where you would land after jumping , but you 'll get used to it quickly.The bosses are surprisingly VERY HARD ! Unless you go onto YouTube or something to see how people beat the bosses , chances are , you 'll be wasting a good amount of lives . But let me tell you this : King Galaxian is THE BEST BOSS LEVEL EVER ! It changes the whole gameplay , letting you control a spaceship instead ( a la Galaxian and Galaga ) and shoot rows of alien ships ! And then comes the boss itself , which still throws bad guys at ya , but also tries to suck your ship toward it ( Galaga ) . Throughout all that , the music and even just the concept of the level makes up for what may possibly be a little frustrating boss fight.Overall , this is a true must-have . It 's a game with some of the best music , graphics , and gameplay all around that a Pac-Man game could ever offer .	1
this game was good it actually has talking in it you do n't have to read everything its pretty difficult in a way that its fun and its not too short there is a story-line to it the game works great no unable to read disc errors or anything like thatthe only downfall is that if you have Pac-man world 2 for GAMECUBE or PS2 you going to be slightly disappointed because Pac-man world 2 is way betterbut that 's just my opiniongreat buy	1
Those who grew up playing games published by Acclaim knew that either they were a ) decent enough or b ) really , really bad that no one should pay to play . You can file this game under surprisingly dark and deep . In 1999 , Acclaim released Shadow Man for the Nintendo 64 , Sony Playstation , Sega Dreamcast and the PC . But with limited advertising , not many people knew about this game but it soon had a cult following . If you are looking for a dark and morbid horror game that is n't Resident Evil , then Shadow Man is a good alternate choice.You control Michael LeRoi , a man who has a dark past that catches up to him and cost him and his family their lives . He gets resurrected by a voodoo priestess who has visions of Apocalypse that will consume the world and recruits him to stop it by any means necessary . She gives him voodoo powers and he sets out to find out how to stop it and who is behind the incoming disaster . You start out in Liveside , which is set in the real world but soon warp to Deadside , a world where only monsters and zombies are known to wander . You come across many weapons to add to your arsenal and you need to seek out artifacts that give you special abilities . Much like Super Mario 64 where you had to collect stars , in this game you collect `` dark souls '' which make you stronger and let you pass through portals to access the other areas . By the end of the game , you would have travel to 17 different areas and be strong enough to face Legion , the end game boss who you must defeat.The PROS : This is a horror game and sets itself apart from the other horror games , especially the dominant Resident Evil and Silent Hill series . The story is dark , moody and while slow at first gets more engrossing to the point that you want to keep playing and find out how all of the main characters are connected . The graphics are n't good now but back then , it was decent enough and the cut scenes detail the story and keeps it moving . Shadow Man takes advantage of the expansion pack so if you did n't have it , you could still play it . However , the bump in the resolution and special effects is good enough to have it installed . The music is haunting and fits the areas you travel in so it sets the mood effectively . The sound effects are just as good from the sound of your weapons , the screams of the monsters you encounter and the background noises in certain areas . It 's a very long journey you will be on so you will need a memory pack to save your progress as you wo n't be beating this game overnight . It 's also pretty hard so expect to die a few times and you may get stuck in some areas so expect to rely on your memory at times to figure out what to do next . If you look in certain sections of each area , you can unlock cheat codes , which are either helpful or give off funny effects.The CONS : Some people may be turned off by horror games so if you do n't play these games or do n't have any interest in this genre , then stay away as this game wo n't help change your mind . The controls , while better than other action/adventure games , are pretty stiff so it will take a bit to get used to them . You can choose from a number of preset controls but you ca n't customize the buttons yourself . Once you 're done with the game , that 's it . Outside of the cheat codes , there is n't anything to unlock or any bonus modes to play through.Shadow Man was and is never meant for little kids to play . There is a considerable amount of swearing , lots of blood and gore and deals with voodoo , harvesting of bodies , monsters that make you cringe and features a story that is twisted enough to keep you on your toes . The mature crowd can appreciate this kind of game . It was never as popular as other horror games , nor has it established itself as a series . But there 's a reason why those who took a chance with this game stuck with it to the end : it was different , it was interesting and was surprisingly dark . Take a chance and get it but if you still are n't convinced , pick up a used copy since it is hard to find it new without paying a premium price .	1
Installing the game was a struggle ( because of games for windows live bugs ) .Some championship races and cars can only be `` unlocked '' by buying them as an addon to the game . I paid nearly 30 dollars when the game was new . I do n't like the idea that I have to keep paying to keep playing.I noticed no improvement in the physics or graphics compared to Dirt 2.I tossed it in the garbage and vowed never to buy another codemasters game . I 'm really tired of arcade style rally/racing games anyway.I 'll continue to get my fix from Richard Burns Rally , and you should to . : ) http : //www.amazon.com/Richard-Burns-Rally-PC/dp/B000C97156/ref=sr_1_1 ? ie=UTF8 & qid ; =1341886844 & sr ; =8-1 & keywords ; =richard+burns+rallyThank you for reading my review ! If you enjoyed it , be sure to rate it as helpful .	-1
1st shipment received a book instead of the game.2nd shipment got a FAKE one . Game arrived with a wrong key inside on sealed box . I got in contact with codemasters and send them pictures of the DVD and the content . They said nothing they can do its a fake DVD.Returned it good bye . !	-1
I ca n't tell you what a piece of dog**** this game is . Like everything else Microsoft makes- it does n't work . When are they going to take a cue from Apple and make things that actually work the first time and every time . To log onto this game they make you jump through a series of hoops that takes like 15 min . to accomplish . If you want another disappointment from Microsoft , buy some `` Games for Windows Live '' games . I just wanted a simple arcade like driving game when I have a young boy visiting . If that 's what you want , do n't buy this . If you want to hire a consultant to help you run this game , then buy it . oh , one more thing , every time I do get this game to play my joystick stops working ( there 's Windows 7 for you )	-1
I still have n't figured this one out . Did everything as instructed but the game never installed . Strange . Since I do n't like to rate on something I could n't get to work , I 'll just say that I did n't like it because I could n't get it to work : P For those that did manage to get it installed , I 'm sure it 's a great game . I had the first Dirt and it was a scream ! Too bad this one bombed . Maybe a bad disc ...	-1
I bought this and the key did n't work . It was a gift , and the recipient was n't able to solve the problem . It might have been a good game , but I never found out because the key failed .	-1
Crashed in Vista . Codemasters told me they do n't support it in Windows 8 . Could n't get it to work even after looking on the Internet .	-1
This game was a rip-off . It has less terrain , less tracks , and less features than DiRT 2 . The graphics are about the same . Not worth the money , at all .	-1
This game is bug landFirst had problems installing because it required some windows market software . Then it did not have any voice sounds . Then it was running on windowed mode only . Now , everytime I end a track it just crashes the computer ( BSoD ) .I give up . Codemasters , next time , dont rush a game out just because you have to . Test the game ! If not for yourself for Colin himself . If he was alive he would be embarrassed.And do n't buy the game using Steam because if it does not work , Steam will show you the finger : )	-1
DiRT 2 was like this . I 'm becoming more & more suspicious of games like this that require a continuous open Internet to play . It just seems like bait set out for some young naive prey to fall for . Does anyone honestly believe that personal information is collected for no particular reason ? I do n't care what they say publicly . Any assurances of privacy protection are quite hollow without close oversight , and nobody 's looking . It 's quite a different thing to knowingly step out into a multiplayer server where you know you 're being tracked , but this type of continuous spying is something more . That aside , this carrot on a stick has more problems than just security.CONS - Requires open Internet ( Windows Live ) to play . Annoying interface . Continuous reminders to upload and download things you already selected not to do . Most settings do n't keep between sessions . Setting up a race takes way too long . Irritating `` music '' you ca n't turn off ( it keeps coming back ) . Takes too long to unlock things . Entire career mode is pointless when the game setup is so irritating I just wanted out . Video stuttering ( possibly my equipment ) .PROS - Eye candy . Plenty of game modes . Enough tracks to get going . Fairly good variety of cars . Scaled difficulty levels from casual to advanced.I think this franchise , like many others , continues soley for the purpose of farming user information ; where it seems the real money is . If I ca n't turn it off , and some else controls the on-off switch , that 's a problem . Sometimes it might be worth it , but not here . I found some entertainment value , but very briefly . Anyway , just my opinion ...	-1
I would like give this game 4 or 5 stars , if I could get it to run . Like others the game crashes on start-up or in the game and Codemasters has been absolutely no help in correcting it . Why they ca n't get their asses in gear ( pun intended ) and fix it I do n't know , but with so many folks reporting the problem it is n't just occasional . I assume they either ca n't replicate the problem or just do n't care . Lacking any help from Codemasters , I 've tried the various fan fixes , including uninstalling Rapture 3D . Also tried installing on Vista and Win 7 and that did n't help either , which is a shame since from the other reviews it seems like a great racing sim .	-1
The game itself is great , but Games for Windows Live is such a frustrating piece of garbage . I wish it would just die and stop bringing down my PC gaming experience .	-1
I can not get this thing to work with my Wii Rockband 3.It might be related to the USB hub that I 'm using , but it simply refuses to be detected by the game.Cosmetically , it 's a microphone . Bit on the ugly side.I would be wary of compatibility issues with this one .	-1
The greatest bait and switch betrayal of a fanbase in videogaming history and most hated game of all time.To begin I will provide Amazon 's customer base the & # 34 ; tale of the turd & # 34 ; as I call it in relation to this abomination 's & # 34 ; quality & # 34 ; or rather lackthereof : Gameplay : Utterly challengeless . A lobotomy patient , a two year old drooling baby in a feces filled diaper or even an individual with a severe case of down syndrome could easily complete this game in a single sitting with minimal effort . Just mash buttons or & # 34 ; spam & # 34 ; the controls as PC gamers would say and you 'll eventually complete this atrocious slap in the face Disney level Aonuma dreck.Graphics : Hideous , vomit inducing , ridiculous , teletubbies-esque , bait and switch from what we were originally promised at Spaceworld 2000 ( realistic style epic , cool and beautiful graphics with a decidedly Lord Of The Rings style flare ) Also there are ugly and gaudy white lines that appear all throughout Wand Wacker indicating Nintendo was not able to polish this turd before release . Oh what a shame.Sound : The only redeemable inspiring thing about this Aonuma dud is the ocean music likely composed by Koji Kondo . The rest is detestable Saturday morning cartoon level kiddy drivel . Soccer moms and grandparents should approve . Real Zelda fans can only vomit at this level of disrespect Nintendo has stooped to in order to insult us.Theme : Near total rip off of Kevin Costner 's Water World to such a great extent I fully believe Costner could probably win a lawsuit against Nintendo for royalties if he so desired . Needless to say this watery environment is not what true Zelda fans look forward to when we go to pick up a new Zelda game . No , what we 're looking for is the green forests and fields of Hyrule proper , not some watery grave that sits atop it for reasons likely relating to Aonuma 's child learning how to bathe for the first time and Aonuma getting inspired to make Zelda into a giant bathing simulator via Wand Wacker . I 've said it before and I 'll say it again Nintendo needs to fire Eiji Aonuma and his entire Zelda team and get normal people developing the Zelda series again for it to return to health.Commentary : The online game journalists also known as professional liars can attempt to re-write history all they like but The Legend Of Celda : Wand Wacker will go down as the most hated videogame of all time and the greatest betrayal of a fanbase in gaming history.This was Nintendo , Miyamoto and Eiji Aonuma 's Vince Mcmahon esque & # 34 ; Screw you ! & # 34 ; to the true Zelda fanbase and by true Zelda fanbase I 'm not referring to the scumbag sycophants that populate online gaming message forums but the market in general who determines whether videogames become massive successes or massive failures and the true Zelda fans spoke loud and clear not once but twice.Two whole times on that Wand Wacker piece of dog excrement first with its original Gamecube release and second with its Wii U HD re-release that this is not the way that they envisioned the Legend Of Zelda series , this is not the way they wanted it to go and as a result Wand Wacker flopped mightily BOTH times as such a Benedict Arnold or Rosenbergs esque betrayal is destined to do.To rephrase a quote from Ridley Scott 's Gladiator : & # 34 ; Marcus Aurelius had a dream that was Zelda and this is not it , THIS IS NOT IT ! & # 34 ; We were lied to and led to believe that the epic , cool , badass , Spaceworld 2000 realistically presented Zelda would be what we would soon be getting on the Gamecube but then much later the bait and switch hideously deformed Celda Wand Wacker made its debut to boos and hisses worldwide and massive hate on the internet was poured it and Nintendo 's way ( before the damage control brainwashing took effect which has left a dishonest internet forum gaming community in its wake who pretends to love Wand Wacker in order to shill and run damage control for Nintendo while real Zelda fans have abandoned Nintendo due to its betrayal of them for the other consoles or PC gaming if they have n't simply upped and left gaming in disgusting over this nasty unnecessary debacle and betrayal of Zelda 's true fans.Eiji Aonuma the hack no talent Jimmy Fallon Of Japan enabled by the out of touch Shigeru Miyamoto has been ruining the Zelda series since he took up its reigns to create the embarrassment known as Majora 's Mask.Aonuma 's first game & # 34 ; Marvelous & # 34 ; failed ( MARVELOUSLY ! ) and he had no credentials at all to be given the Zelda series but insanely Nintendo gave it to him and ever since he 's been driving Zelda along with it 's sales figures into the ground making one boring puzzle filled bad NPC filled faux Zelda game after another.When the truth of the matter is Zelda is supposed to be an arcade action adventure sword and sorcery game with light RPG elements thrown in for good measure.Aonuma completely butchers this formula in favor of the boring garbage gameplay elements he prefers and the market lets him know what it thinks of his efforts by making sure his version of Zelda ends up in the bomba discount gaming bins where such low quality trash belongs.In anycase to re-iterate so as to set this very important point in stone once more : Wand Wacker offers up literally no gameplay challenge whatsoever and can be completed by a lobotomy patient ( as is typical of Aonuma offerings ) .Conclusion : My rating of this turd is 1 star since I ca n't give it lower due to how Amazon 's system is set up .	-1
Are 9 out of 10 GAMECUBE games like this little kid 's game terrible ? Answer : YesI bought the game , and I regret it so much !	-1
I was very disappointed in this item . We thought we would get a better picture than the standard WII video cables , but definatley took a leap in the wrong direction . I would not recommend .	-1
I enjoyed the first Hawx game . However they left out some key things in Hawx 21 ) No coop mode - I really enjoyed that2 ) Ca n't choose your own plane right off the bat . You have to use whatever they tell you.Those two things will make me not play this game anymore !	-1
I loved the first Hawx PC game when it came out . Playing Hawx 2 got boring after several missions , is just a shame .	-1
There are at least 5 missions that can not be completed without joining the forum , then the Creator 's Forum , and a lot of research , downloading , etc . 4 of these defective missions were built by `` Bottman '' ... someone that should definitely find another occupation.BUT ... do not waste your time because the missions are incredibly boring and far from challenging . The ones they label as `` Hard '' are as easy as those labeled `` Easy '' . My 6-year granddaughter could do most of them after 15 minutes of instruction.Do not buy this product . The GFX are circa 2003 , the user interface far from intuitive , and the support abysmal . It 's a waste of money & time.Too bad . Ship.sim 2006 was actually better ... .AND all the missions worked . Vstep took one giant step backward .	-1
My father is a seaman . I have seen many ships , sailed with him around the world numerous times . So ships are in my blood . When i saw this game I bought it without batting an eyelid . Well I wish I did n't because I now regret my decision.The game is unique in its concept . We never really had a maritime ship simulation that was n't centrally focused on war and sinking other ships : ) . This one happens to be just peace-time shipping simulation with different kinds of detailed ships ranging from cargo , to passenger , to rescues , to towing , to even trying to alter history by succesfully sailing Titanic to New york on its first maiden voyage etc . The game creator has gone to great details to simulate as much as possible the Intricacies of piloting as well as managing huge ships operations . Any aspiring sea captian or sea salt will identify with some if not most aspects of piloting a ship as simulated in this game . But to me thats where all the goodies end.The cons associated with game are just too game-breaking to me and i have essentially stopped playing the game . Until these issues gets addressed i am not spending anymore money on this games series.First and foremost this game badly needs a voluntary `` Time Compression '' feature . Not all of us have 2-3 hours to devote each time we decide to play this game to have some fun . Sometimes it take an hour or so just to get out of harbour and tag some hours more on this to complete the mission . With a game in which you are looking at ocean waves for hours this gets boring really fast . This is just plain very annoying and game destroying factor to me . I know some people have all the time in the world to savour and enjoy games but a lot dont too . Since its not a action oriented game the passage of time is felt even more . If they can incorporate a Time Compression feature it will make the game lot more open to different segments of gamers.Second is the still dated graphics engine . I see lots of people commenting on how good the graphics look . I have a pretty good rig and i can play games like Mass Effect and Silent Hunter 4 in almost thearatical quality but even with everything maxed out this game just looks medicore graphics wise . The ships and ocean etc . looks very simplistically rendered from today 's standard . The graphical quality of this game released in 2008 is kind of dissappointing though.Last some of the missions in the game are just plain novice or fillers in my opinion . This game is geared towards people who like to pilot huge ships yet we have a lot of missions devoted to speed boats for stunts , hover boats etc . I bought the game to simulate a ship expirience not go around flipping in speed boats.Anyways..i would n't really recommend anyone spend $ 40 bucks on this game . Wait until it gets to $ 19 or so bargain bin . And i hope the developers put some real effort into make a more viable ship simluator for its next incarnation or you are not getting any more money from me .	-1
This thing was DOA . It was n't even worth returning for the money I spent on it . Do n't waste your money on this card .	-1
I bought 4 of these , 1 of which was shipped to me with defects , and 2 more became defective within about 2 weeks of normal use . I would not recommend these to any one , but could n't give a 1 star as1 of 4 cords still works fine	-1
I bought this game way back and recently played it again.. well..the game was easy to beat when i was 6 and its still as easy.Well , my problem ( s ) ? Not enough characters and its just not very fun and.. yeah that makes it boring.. but if ur a fan of the older games ( like me ) you may like this game ( unlike me ) It 's cheap now so , I guess it would n't hurt to pick it up.. it costs as much cash as to rent a game at the videostore..so do what you want with it .	-1
Breath of Fire Three is the third part to what was a very good series of RPGs . Breath of Fire One seems to be what most people I talk to about games consider the best . Even though I loved Breath of Fire 2 the most . I expected a lot from breath of fire 3 . Perhaps this helped lower my opinion of Breath of fire 3 , but I did not like this game.As far as game play goes like all BoF games in BoF 3 you have the ability to turn into a dragon . Like BoF 1 and unlike BoF2 when you turn into a dragon you stay one for a while . While you 're a dragon you loose MP every turn to keep you from staying one forever in that combat unlike BoF 1 . All the character seem to get their own special power . The character list is short and one of the characters on the list of the book never fights with you as a character . The training system you can find people to help you with is actually kind of pointless weird and honestly I did n't like it . The town to town walking is slow and you never get fast transportation.As far as plot goes the plot is the plot starts off okay . Then about two hours in goes in a different direction . It is fine for a while then but around the end is a large dungeon that is boring to go threw and leaves the any not very much of a climax . They lost any suspense you could have built up similar to the Tales Of Destiny ending . Also the characters do n't have very strong and noticeable personalities . Also if you keep up with it you wo n't like the direction the plot takes thirds of the way threw.As far as control goes it 's basically standard of with noting exceptionally notable about it.The graphics to this game are not very good . It is done in sprites . Sometimes I myself prefer sprits but I do not like the character drawings of this game . On the walking town to town map character looks chubby and short . The drawings are basic and too simple . There was only one of the dragons I liked the look of . However there is a little onion that can follow around with your party who beat all other RPGs in cuteness of a single character . The cute hopping onion is defiantly the main reason to buy this game if you do.And finally as far as length of time it can stay interesting the game is longer them many RPGs wo n't be beaten on a short rental . If you get this game buy it.Overall this game is the worst of the BoF series . I do n't recommend buying it unless its finishes some collection you are working on , or if you have to see a hopping onion follow people around .	-1
this is an excellent game that really has some substance ! the graphics are not the best and it is oversahdowed by the bigger game final fantasy VII . if FF7 was too long for you , get breath of fire 3. the story is good and the battle system is great !	-1
yeah the cpu is like completley retarded gulie does not counter with his flip kicks ryu doesnt ever do his shukoken uppercuts to counter but some of the characters can be pretty hard like T. Hawk but i just dont get the street fighter arcade - like feeling	-1
I actually played the Saturn version with the 4MB RAM cart , and I have to say that the PS1 version SUCKS ! Why ? Because tag-team was taken out because the PS1 could not handle it . It did not have enough RAM ( Random Access Memory ) to switch fighters since it takes about at least 40 MB of RAM , and the PS1 only has 32 MB . If Capcom did put in tag-team , then it would take forever to load up a character once you tag-team with it , you can tag-team with the same character , but it does not feel the same.I suggest get a Saturn , ( it is only $ 10 bucks or less ) get a 4MB RAM cart which you can find at EB.com , or any Video game store , and get the Import version of X-men vs. Street Fighter , trust me you wont be disappointed .	-1
To say that the PS1 version of Capcom 's X-Men VS Street Fighter is butchered is saying it lightly . What made the game so great in arcades was the tag-team feature in which you picked two fighters and could switch at any time during the fight . This feature made for great fighting fun , but because of the PS1 's RAM inabilities , that feature had to be omitted . It 's obvious Capcom released this game to make a quick buck on the X-Men and Street Fighter licenses , and while on it 's own it can be a solid fighter without the tag-team feature , the graphics are painfully watered down , the game is loaded with sloppy frame rates , and there is loads of slowdown . If you can get past all that , this may be worth checking out if your a Street Fighter fan , but the Marvel VS Capcom games that would be released later on next-gen systems are more worth your time .	-1
When a system is incapable of doing justice to a game , one would think a company would be smart enough to not release the game on that system . But for reasons that are probably based entirely around making money , Capcom has released a completely butchered version of its arcade fighter , X-Men vs. Street Fighter , on the PlayStation . The only thing added to the game is super cancels , which allow you to string multiple super combos together . Super cancels were lifted out of Street Fighter EX without much forethought , so some characters ' cancels work better than others . In fact , the entire game seems to have been designed without much forethought . Even if this were a perfect translation of the arcade game , the simple fact remains that X-Men vs. Street Fighter is a terrible , unbalanced , pound-on-buttons-at-random-and-win-anyway fighting game.One of the few things the arcade version ( and the Saturn version , which was an arcade-perfect translation ) had going for it was the graphics . They were n't spectacular , but the characters were large , colorful , and used a lot of frames of animation . The PlayStation , a fairly weak machine when it comes to 2D , simply ca n't handle that much data . So Capcom chopped out tons of frames ( Juggernaut does a whole lot of standing still , and his attacks are about two frames ) . The graphics look very washed out , and there is a completely unacceptable amount of slowdown . Ken 's Shinryuken super combo had most of the frames chopped out , and it still slows the game down to a crawl . The slowdown and missing frames are so bad and so noticeable that they have a detrimental effect on the already bad gameplay.The arcade version 's big selling point was that you picked two characters and could tag-team between the two at any time during the fight . Your teammate would also come out and help in a two-level team attack , as well as in Alpha counter-style attacks . Since duplicating this on the PlayStation would require keeping four entire sets of animations in memory , the tag feature has been completely removed . You still pick a second character ( cruelly taunting players expecting the full functionality of the arcade version ) , but he only makes his presence felt during the team attacks and counters . To make up for the shortened play time , the one-round battles of the arcade have been extended to the standard two-out-of-three format . Characters also slowly regain life , much like your backup character would in the arcade.This game just should n't exist . At some point in the development cycle , someone should have stepped in , seen that the PlayStation simply could n't do justice to the original game , and pulled the plug . It took an additional 4MB of RAM to get the Saturn , which already has more RAM than the PlayStation , to run a perfect version of the game . I like the Street Fighter series as much as the next guy , but this is taking it way too far .	-1
I spent a week trying to get a grasp of the controls for this game . I 'm a true Batman fan and even I had to put this game down after several attempts . It was either too dark so you did n't know where the character was going or you could n't establish enough control of the game to fight the bad guys . Not real crazy about the commute to the crime location as well , it was hard to locate where you were going , unless you are the true dark knight who knows every inch of Gothem City . Unfortunately , the writers expected us to know as well .	-1
Yes I 'll review Batman & Robin to the Playstation and why could n't have been like Batman Forever arcade . It 's wrose than Batman Forever on SNES and Genesis . I do n't know which is wrose this game or the Joel Schumacer film . Becuse I do n't know what to do after I get the diamond . I know what I 'm getting with the film a very bad one . Just leave them both alone .	-1
This game is complete crap.The graphics look decent , but the gameplay is for sh**.I ca n't even begin to tell you how bad `` Batman & Robin '' is.First off , the controls are terrible.You have a hell of a time trying to figure out how to fight , drive the batmobile , swim , use the gadgets ... it 's even a pain to try and walk.The map of Gotham is very small and all of the buildings of the area look the same.The game is also almost impossible.You get one life.After you die , it 's game over , and right back to the beginning.You can also die quickly as well.You can play as either Batman , Robin or Batgirl , but their combat moves look absolutley retarded.Overall , this is THE WORST Batman game I have EVER PLAYED ! `` Batman Forever '' on Genesis was better then this dud , and we all know how bad that game was.I HIGHLY recommend that you DO NOT buy this.The ONLY reason why you MIGHT wan na purchase this , is because it 's a pretty rare game , and it could be a part of your game collection , but as far as the game itself goes ... .IT SUCKS !	-1
The graphics and gameplay are very out dated . The movies at the end are stupid and only the first eight players have them . The only reason I even got this game is because I loved Tekken 2,3 , Tag , and 4 . The only reason I do n't sell this is I want to have all the tekkens , but if you want to buy it , do n't pay more than $ 2 for it .	-1
You know you 're in trouble when other terrible video games are compared to you . Though only a little worse than Charlie 's Angels ( GameCube ) and not as bad as Hidden Invasion ( PlayStation2 ) , Fighting Force is the difinitive bad adventure-fighting game that fits on the same crap list as Burning Fight . Even Brawl Bros and Peace Keepers are better than this , and that 's saying a lot.You get your pick from four forgettable crime fighters : pixie-pig-tailed Alana , gruff Hawk , leather-pants-wearing `` Look at me , I 'm Nabiki Tendo '' Mace , and prison inmate Smasher . They 're out to get a psychopath who believes the world should have ended at the beginning of 2000 A.D. and is now determined to make that happen . Maybe he should have waited through the other 23 times it turned New Years day across the world.Many Sega Saturn owners did n't realize then how lucky they were that this game was cancelled on their system . Nintendo 64 owners were not so lucky , and I was n't so lucky after getting the PlayStation version.The controls are sloppy , the hit detection is horrible , especially the dash attacks , and the character animation is almost jerky enough to look like an old claymation cartoon.If there is one redeeming factor , it is the music . Though not great , the musical scores in this game are a nice touch . The only reason you should buy this disc is to pop it into a CD-playing radio or computer and skip track one since that 's just a data track ... meaning all you will hear , if anything , is an annoying buzz . Start on Track 2 , sit back , and enjoy the only good thing about this game .	-1
I was only 5 years old my first time playing this game back in Christmas of 1997 . I was never able to get past the first couple levels then . But I always loved this game . It was magic back then . The graphics were also great THEN . Second time around , I was 12 and it was 2004 . I was able to finally finish the entire game and find all the secrets to . Now in 2012 , I had the urge to replay this game again . To get those feeling of being so young . I 'm 19 , and the magic is completely gone , and for ONE REASON.BE WARNED ... ... if you have a full HD TV and have a PS3 , and bought a physical copy of this game ... ... the playback visuals of this game will be absolutely HORRIBLE ! It completely hinders your ability to even play through the game because EVERYTHING is so pixelated if you will . Like I NEVER remembered this game looking so bad before , but I have to assume it had always looked this way but I was in a different era of technology then . HD TVs are completely unforgiving to these types of games . I 'm not sure if the the digital copy available on the PSN is any better , but the actual physical copy is not meant for a HD display even in it respective aspect ratio . Maybe just playing this game on standard definition TV might help , but I have n't tried that either . I will just have to remember the game like when I was young as the best PS1 game I ever played and then later the only one I ever beat . To the future gamers !	-1
I 'm going to fly in the face of convention wisdom and assert that Tomb Raider is not a good game . I like the concept , the puzzle solving and exploration . I like that it 's a great diversion from the standard shoot-em up . The problem is with the tedious game play . The game is tough , just from the mental standpoint and it takes some effort to figure out what you 're supposed to be doing in each level . But that 's part of the fun , figuring things out . Unfortunately , it 's moving through the levels and getting from point A to point B that is problematic . There are way too many places where you have to make a pinpoint precision jump or other move with absolutely NO margin for error . In some cases this means you fall somewhere and have to climb back to your starting point , or in some cases you die , meaning you have to start the whole level over again . And after trying one of these jumps over and over and over , you finally get frustrated and give up . There were instances where I tried a jump over and over , and then suddenly made the jump and had no idea what I had done differently from the previous numerous attempts . For any game to be that touchy is just a disgrace . It 's too bad , I think I could have liked this game but the tedious pinpoint controller movements ulitmately ruined the game for me . I know it 's one of PSX & quot ; greatest hits & quot ; and very popular , but if do n't like tedious games , you 'll want to avoid this one .	-1
I *hate* this game . Let me state right away : graphics in a WWE wrestling game mean absolutely NOTHING to me . The graphics in WWF War Zone are pretty good ( and original , back in the day ) but who cares ? It seems the only thing wrestling video game fans today are interested in is looking at their television set in amazement because the wrestlers look realistic , and their movements true to life . Who cares ? When War Zone first hit the scene in the late 90 's yeah , the graphics WERE cool . Not now , especially when the only thing the WWE cares about these days is impressing gamers with realism.You know , WWF War Zone was the very first game that brought the graphics to a whole new 3D level . A whole new level of crap . You see , it makes me sick that the WWE wrestling games for 10 years now are all basically the same . Let me explain why this is a bad thing.You know when you buy an updated sports video game ( such as football or hockey ) and the only thing different about it from the previous year are a couple new player names , and maybe some new options here and there ? That 's exactly what the WWE has done with their video games . For the last 10 years all the WWE games have been WAY too similar to each other , and it completely sucks out the fun when every new wrestling game that hits the market only offers a slight difference over the previous years game.It does n't matter if it 's Smackdown , Smackdown 2 , WWE Raw for the Xbox , WWE Wrestlemania for the Gamecube , etc . Those games are all the same- a lousy attempt to impress gaming and wrestling fans with realism . I 'm all for realism , but it DOES NOT MATTER in a wrestling game . A wrestling game is like any other video game in that it SHOULD be all about having fun with it . And I ca n't have fun with a wrestling game released today that , more or less , is exactly the same as a wrestling game from 10 years ago . It makes me sick to think 10 years later , hardly anything has changed in the world of wrestling video games.Before WWF War Zone , you had WWF In Your House which , to this day , is a game that completely stands apart from other WWE wrestling games ( along with WWF Wrestlemania : The Arcade Game ) . Before those games you had the button-smashing delight of WWF Raw on the Super NES and Sega Genesis . Once again , the formula in those old-school wrestling games did n't stick around and overstay its welcome . Over 10 years with games just like WWF War Zone IS too much.The very second WWF War Zone came out on the Playstation and N64 , it all went wrong . Game companies got the idea that people wanted realism in their wrestling games , so from that point on ALL the WWE games had to be about having realistic-looking gameplay and wrestler appearances , and the fun factor washed away like sandcastles on the beach . It 's hard to have fun with a game when the year before you were playing the same thing . After a while you get sick of it.WWF War Zone is an innovative game for taking wrestling to new heights , but it was the WORST thing that could have happened . Graphically , WWF War Zone is the first of its kind . Being the first means it 's bound to have some flaws ( despite the fact that existing is its biggest flaw ! ) Another MAJOR problem with the game is how SLOW it is . After the adrenaline-rushing WWF In Your House , we now experience wrestlers walking around in the ring VERY slowly . Painfully slow , in fact . Going from WWF In Your House to WWF War Zone is like going from a cheetah race to a snail race . Your grandparents can wrestle each other faster than the wrestlers in this game . To be fair , the ONLY thing WWF wrestling games today have improved is the speed . Everything else is the same as it was 10 years ago.WWF War Zone also started the popular `` create a wrestler '' mode . But it does n't matter because , as I mention above , wrestling games for 10 years have had that option . It 's an option that has lost its charm because of overkill , and it 's time game companies got rid of it , or did something to drastically change it . It was a fun and interesting idea at first but now , 10 years later , I do n't want to have it in a wrestling game ever again.I tried getting rid of WWF War Zone at a yard sale but no one wanted it , so I had to get rid of it by throwing it away . No way was I keeping such a crappy game in the same shelf with MUCH more deserving Playstation games.If only WWE was more innovative with their wrestling games today , instead of repeating the same formula every year , I would n't have to keep going back and pointing out WWF War Zone as the game where the downfall began . After 10 years , updating the graphics and adding just a few new options and wrestlers does n't get the job done .	-1
When I first got this game , I found it to be boring not too soon after getting it . When I play it today , I still think it 's boring ! WWF War Zone is the first real WWF wrestling game to be released on the Playstation . I do n't really consider the In Your House game to be wrestling wise , but more Mortal Kombat like.War Zone is based off the WWF roster from late 1997 to early 1998 , featuring only the most popular stars in the game . Among the wrestlers in this game , you can choose to play as Stone Cold Steve Austin , Shawn Michaels , Bret Hart , The Undertaker , The Rock , Triple H , Mankind , Goldust , Owen Hart , Ahmed Johnson , Farrooq , British Bulldog , Ken Shamrock , and The Headbangers.The opening of the game is cool , as you 're given a Raw like intro that used to open Monday Night Raw back in the mid to late 90s . From there on , you 're taken to the menu screen that 's in the form of an elevator . In the menu you can look at the wrestlers ' biographies that let you listen to their theme and see their attires they wear in the game . There 's also a Training mode on the menu that lets you pick a wrestler and learn how to perform their moves before you go into the game.Once you enter the game , you can either play Exhibition matches to get adjusted to everything or go straight to Challenge Mode . Among the match types available are Singles , Tag Team , Tornado Tag Team , Hardcore , or Steel Cage . The Steel Cage match is probably the most frustrating match to play . When you climb the cage , I did n't know what button to push to climb down . I pushed down but I just ended up climbing back down to the ring . I lost most of the Cage matches.Challenge Mode involves you choosing a superstar to play as and guide them to the World Championship . Unfortunately this was a boring and irritating mode to play . Once you play one match , you 've played them all . You have to fight the same opponents at least 4 or 5 times before you advance to newer ones . As you progress through , you 'll be met by a woman in a limo in the parking lot who will either show interest you for winning a match or insult you for losing a match . Oh yeah , that 's another thing . If you lose 1 or 2 matches , you 're automatically sent back to the beginning and have to start over from match 1 to go up . It ultimately screws you over and you 're forced to play a lot of the same boring matches again.Overall : I found War Zone boring then and I find it boring now . In my opinion In Your House is more fun to play than this . Even the sequel game to War Zone , Attitude , is more fun to play than War Zone . So if you do n't want to be bored , skip War Zone and buy In Your House or Attitude instead	-1
This wwf game sucks ... Boring ... Graphics are alright ... It was just plain awful EVEN FOR IT 'S TIME ! UGH this game was slo [ ... ] get this game..GET NO MERCY ! BEST WWF GAME EVER ! ... This game was very dull and boring ... If I could give it a zero I would ... THIS GAME FLAT OUT SUCKS ! good thing I Baught this for a 2 bucks ... .But still that was a waste ... Later	-1
Getting this game would be a waste of time and money . For halfthe price of this I 'd rather get a game that offers better graphics , better realism , and better everything . If you have n't already guessed it 's Red Alert . Even though it looks pretty good , after about a week you wo n't want to play it anymore . With Red Alert I continually go back to try just one more strategy ... I think they just sat down and set a deadline for this game and the guys making it waited until the last week to do it . Right now all you need to do is type in the search box up there & quot ; Red Alert & quot ; and buy that game ... You will have a way better game and not spend as much .	-1
Unless you intend to cheat and mod the game do n't waste your money.Uneven gameplay , and few options plague this game , it is also way too short even at this reduced price.Spend your money on a game , just not this one.Hope this helps , I hate to have games collecting dust , but this is one of those and I own about 50 recent games so I know what 's what .	-1
I thought Red Alert was a pretty fun game . This was just a clone of red alert though . The people that make C & amp ; C need to come up with some more ideas . All the C & amp ; C games are exactly the same . I did n't like Red Alert to start with so Tiberian Sun has to be worse .	-1
All right , the graphics are nice and the terrain damage is something new , but that does n't make up for the gameplay , which could be summed up in one word : SLOW.Skirmishes take a real long time to get going ; I mean , at least a half an hour before you can get a sizeable force . And then what do you find yourself doing ? Protecting your base with them , and attacking with missle launches . I 'm dead serious , the only way to attack is with missle launches . To attack with your men ( Especially tanks ) takes like ten minutes to even get to the enemy base ! That being said , the multiplayer is a total waste of time . If the person your playing saves you the trouble of teching and attacks you early on with engineers , consider yourself lucky . Do n't get caught up in a 3 hour game that is just about to be resolved , when you or your opponent loses his/her connection . And do n't consider engineering a cheap way to attack , it 's the only way anyone attacks ... THe campaign is allright I guess , if you can stand the poor gameplay to get from cutscene to cutscene ( Which are n't as good as Red Alerts were ) ... .. Come on , you ca n't tell me NOD does n't have a huge advantage over GDI . They do.Let 's hope Kane bites the dust soon , before the C & amp ; C series turns as twisted as & quot ; The Forgotten & quot ; .	-1
the game 's okay , although i do n't think making the charactersin 3d was a very good idea , plus at some points game gets outrightboring , and all the main characters smoke ... although the game will crash sometimes , and it might get stuck , overall , the game is pretty much okay if you do n't count crashes and how the characters act and look ... END	-1
I found Half-Life to be somewhat interesting , although it started to run thin by the ending levels . Not many of the levels were amazing , either . Just long hallways , small rooms , and an occasional elevator shaft that you climb up . I like 3D games that let you be outside , looking over vast plains of enemies and obstacles . Half-Life just did n't cut it in this arena.Another thing that I found most disturbing was the extreme gore/violence that is present throughout the game . When your science project goes wrong , you walk out to find a scientist lying on the ground with about 10 gallons of blood spread all over the walls and floor ! Were the programmers just trying to be sick here or what ? When you reach the levels in which you begin to fight the army grunts ( who are the best enemies ) , it gets even more grotesque . If you let off an entire clip of bullets at one guy , expect to see a wall covered with blood . Sure , you can turn it off , but it does very little good . The blood is still very disturbing . This is one aspect of the game that is extremely unacceptable . I am not a parent saying this , either , I 'm a teenager.Aside from the violence and lack of interesting levels , the game is pretty much void of any lasting qualities . If you want a weekend of pure hell ( both keeping you stuck to your computer and grossing you out entirely ) then buy this game . Otherwise , do n't bother .	-1
this is the stuppidiest game i 've ever played . I advise everyone not to play it or buy it . It really sucked .	-1
this game is the hardest game ive ever played , and that takes away the fun . also graphics very poor even for nintendo 64 can not even recommend for people i dislike dont waste your time or money worst n64 game ever	-1
Banjo-Kazooie is a strange platformer , but ultimately misses the mark in all key areas of being entertaining . It tries to be funny without actually being exciting to play . All the attention on humor and yet , the game itself is hardly ever fun . This means children would probaly be able to overlook the games flaws and focus on the humor , which I 'm sure was Nintendo 's intentions- to market the game for kids and assume they would n't be able to detect the lousy game design . I guess the Nintendo 64 struggling to make a profit at the time meant Nintendo had to do absolutely anything to try and get *any* type of crowd interested in their products despite the poor quality we 're forced to persevere , so that explains Banjo Kazooie 's existence.Anyway , Banjo-Kazooie is basically nothing but an item-collecting quest with graphics that are admittedly prettier and just better than 90 % of the stuff the N64 was pumping out at the time . The waters , grassy lands , mountains ... everything is a beautiful sight to behold with crystal clear authentically pleasing environments . But seriously , why am I basically doing nothing but walking around collecting items the entire time ? If you think `` That 's what ALL platformers do ! '' guess again : many of them focus on exciting enemy variety , diverse surroundings and a gradual increase in challenge which this game sorely lacks . The only challenge is to avoid falling from high narrow platforms while collecting musical notes- these are dirty tricks and artificial challenges . I found sharks you have to swim away from , crabs you can stomp on top of , and weird gigantic green enemies that come out of walls while you 're trying to make your way across high paths without falling . These enemies only appear like 10 % of the time- the rest of your surroundings are n't very threatening.Let 's see all the things you have to collect . Honeycomb pieces , jiggy pieces ( mandatory to open entrances to new locations and you need to obtain a certain number of them per world ) , 100 musical notes which is a total ripoff of Super Mario 64 with the 100 coins needed to get a star , mumbo tokens used to cast spells , and jinjo tokens used to win vehicle parts . You can turn into animals and insects which is somewhat satisfying for the sake of seeing the occasional brief moments of diversity , but otherwise nothing to get really excited about . Often you have to climb trees to reach the items on top and it gets boring after a while , believe me.Oh and the game is a victim of underwater tragedies- you 're constantly adjusting the camera for a more appropriate angle but finding that it 's much harder than it needs to be . I will never understand why Nintendo refuses to fix water portions in 3D platform gaming . It 's mind-boggling . They did n't even fix them in Super Mario Galaxy 2 , a game released a good 10 years after Banjo-Kazooie . The characters are all forgettable , including the ponytail-sporting female bear and Banjo himself . Kazooie the bird is probably the only tolerable one of the bunch.Whereas the Mario series can be enjoyed by kids and adults respectively , Banjo-Kazooie is certainly intended solely for children and no other age group . It 's too shallow of a game overall to satisfy adult gamers . Banjo-Kazooie is like walking into the nicest looking restaurant in town and everything is great except for one thing- you get a small quantity of food so you ask yourself `` Is it worth my time to return here again ? ''	-1
Not one of the best games . I would have rather played Mario just once . I only play it for about two minutes . I fall asleep afterward .	-1
When I looked for the game I was looking for this for a tear Play Station 3 . The view on this game I liked . When I received it was not discovered for version 3 , but 2.I am very upset	-1
I have played this game before and it is very fun ! That is why I came to Amazon to order myself another copy of the game so that I could go back in time and enjoy a classic game . However , I bought it from the seller & # 34 ; Warehouse Deals , Inc & # 34 ; and I did NOT get my game and there is no place for me to get in contact with them . Watch Out !	-1
This game is ok , but mostly mediocre . This is the best that the N64 had to offer alongside the wrestling games and resident evil 2 ? Just goes to show that the nintendrone cult are way off the mark . The Sony playstation 1 had better games and far better immersion due to having the CD storage . This game like i said is ok but hardly as good as the nintendrones have made it out to be . The production of the game is basically weak , with the menu intro being pathetic , and the music repeating over and over and over on each board . The gameplay is ok in that i can mow down enemies while running , but the aiming sucks and it gets boring having to mow down enemies that keep spawning over and over while i figure out how to complete the mission.Finally the multiplayer is wayyyyyy overrated . I remember playing it with 4 other players all day for a couple days and never feeling into it . the quad split screen was a big nuisance . Thank goodness for online play today - the games today completely own goldeneye in every category , especially the funfactor.So yeah - there you go nintendrones - the playstation brand rightfully won that gen and your crowning achievement in console gaming has turned out to be a dated and weak title . Oh yeah Rare is now exposed as being mediocre - your cult like devotion to nintendo made them rich at least . They have n't made anything decent since though	-1
I just wan na review out something no ones said yet.If you still ever play this game , it is a great game , it 's 5 stars , provided your into this sort of thing.But recently when i played the playstation version , i noticed they jibbed out and didnt include certain things that the PC version and better version had.First off - There is no train . The PC version has a fully working train that you can hijack and even put into reverse.. sure , it may be useless to crash into another train , but it was entertaining . The PS version doesnt have a train.. but yet , it has the tracks for it , so go figure that one out.Next , lack of vehicles . The PC version doesnt have spots where cars just disapeer and it feels like your walking around a ghost town.And something no one can say wouldnt be better ... you can edit the PC version , not only can you put whatever car you want into the game by downloading a simple quick device them importing a car you can download or make yourself , but you can also change everything in the game with simmilar tools . You can not just add cars , you can add missions , put more cars into things , edit the exsisting map , or hell , make your own city from scratch.When I play this game , i like to ride around in Knight Rider , or maybe the General Lee , try and eulude cops driving lambourghinis ... gouranga ! Convinced the PC versions better ? Makes you feel like the PSX you played was lacking , huh ?	-1
mario kart is not fun there is no secret characthers or secret places [ i think ] . I tried the game for an hour and was completly bored now i do n't like racing games . The producers should have tried a little harder on this game i was completly unsatified .	-1
I have the wii version and is HORRIBLE . JUST LIKE YOU HIT AN OPPONENT WITH A SHELL , PASS , AND WITH NO ITEM , THE CPU BOOSTS WAY AHAED . HORRIBLE	-1
Rogue squadon is somewhat fun to play but the majority of the missions are hard to beat . the 3D enviroment is cool looking and on some levels there are places you can see that are straight out of the movie such as Jabba the hutt 's palace on Tattoine.The main problem i have with this game is on the Hoth and Deathstar mission . ( use password DEADDACK to get to them ) on the Hoth mission you wrap a cord around Imperial walkers to trip them which is tricky to do . As for the Deathstar mission , the scenery is wrong . In the movie Luke fires at the exhaust port at the end of the trench , in the game the target is on the ground . But that 's not what bothers me most though , After you hit your target it just says `` Mission Complete '' They should 've had a cinematic sequence where the Deathstar blows up . That does n't happen in the game which leaves you feeling angry and unsatisfied .	-1
Every once in a while I experience a piece of entertainment that is *so* overrated it 's hard to believe I 'm even living on the same planet as those that actually believe this is supposed to be the best . The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time is that very piece of overrated entertainment . Talk about a video game that not only does n't live up to the hype ( not even close ) but it does n't do a darn thing to impress me even *if* I were to ignore all the exaggerated hype . This is a serious letdown of a video game . But again , please understand I 'm not from the same planet as those that enjoy this game . I care about gameplay and replay value more than anything else . Apparently most Zelda fans believe puzzle-based dungeons and soulless overworlds are what defines the Zelda series.One thing that positively stinks is that the land of Hyrule , despite being presented as beautiful ( and realistic- do n't tell me Nintendo was n't riding the 3D high in 1998 and going for realism here ) it 's basically a gigantic piece of nothingness . Simply a means of getting from one area to another . A large , colorless empty field that Link either runs or rides his horse across . Nothing magical , medieval or interesting about *any* of this . It feels too much like taking a typical walk across the field beside my house . Going into this game after a Link to the Past , you 'll be scratching your head wondering what happened to the huge variety of overworld enemies , pretty and colorful environments and enticing obstacles . Remember all those trees , rocks , grass and water sections from Link to the Past ? Remember how rich and vibrant they looked ? Ha , nothing nearly as diverse is featured in this bland and inferior overworld . Oh sure the monsters come out at night ( in predictable spots ) but that 's it . As far as I can see , only one monster actually comes out ( named Stalchild ) . Terribly lacking . The trees are spaced apart in a way that feels lacking too.The dungeons is where this game severely misses the mark to such an extent that it 's almost unfathomable to believe Nintendo thought releasing the game the way it is was enough to be sufficient . Again , where ARE all the enemies ? Why am I roaming through temple rooms that are way too big for their own good ? Are high ceilings and deep pits supposed to justify the lack of enemies because the tradeoff is that it feels like I 'm really inside a castle now ? Give me a break guys . The rooms are so big they basically have no life whatever . Instead of being loaded with enemies around every corner , these castles are alarmingly empty , lifeless and unacceptable . But ... that 's apparently okay , because Ocarina of Time is the first 3D Zelda game so its legendary influence and innovation makes it leaps and bounds above the sequels , right ? Not in my world baby . The games following Ocarina of Time perfected the Zelda formula way more effectively . Wind Waker and Skyward Sword leaves this dated mess in the dust.While normally I do n't care about graphics in a video game , you got ta admit that bright vibrant colors really make the epic heroic adventurous theme of the Zelda series more engrossing . This is just ... gross . Only the realistic-looking ( flawed ) overworld is a sight to behold ( which of course now looks significantly better in Twilight Princess ) . Clearly the effort involved in designing the dungeons is n't much to admire . I do n't really mind the occasional choppiness concerning the edges of buildings , trees or other objects that are all part of the Nintendo 64 's datedness . Sometimes these unintentional features can be quite charming or , at the very least , forgiving . What I DO mind however is when these features are all over the place to the point of being a distraction , or having a game entirely too long so we 're forced to persevere these issues time and time again . In other words I 'd be willing to forgive this particular shortcoming if the game made up for the choppy/uninspiring graphics in other areas . Sadly , it does n't . This is n't even much of an issue compared to the other complaints I have ( which I 'll mention below- keep reading ) . These graphics -especially the ones in the dungeons- resemble the ones found in the ruins of Mega Men Legends and the walls of the Quake series . The graphics in Link to the Past are unique and can not be compared to any other game.Let 's discuss the dungeons , shall we ? Despite being ridiculously and needlessly large with boring surroundings , most of them have such a small and uninteresting variety of enemies that it 's almost a chore going through one generic room after another . Ocarina of Time shows the makings of early 3D development at its most obvious- the platforms are predictable square structures that requires the player to spend most of his or her time lining up Link in order to make proper jumps by turning the camera until Link is positioned enough to reach the platform directly ahead . When you combine the constant requirement of having to change camera angles with having to position Link correctly all for the purpose of being able to see what you 're doing and where you 're going , it 's enough to make you think you 're playing with string puppets . Again , early 3D design flaws and datedness.The storytelling is really basic and predictable . It 's never elaborate like in Wind Waker or Skyward Sword . It 's mainly about rescuing or saving these mountainous cave creatures called Goron 's for the first half , and going back and forth from the past to the present in the second half . This is a really uninteresting way of time travelling that feels almost nonexistent due to being so poorly and unsatisfyingly implemented . It does n't even feel or look like you 're going 7 years into the future as Link 's appearance is supposed to be that of an older person but he does n't appear to be much different from his younger self . Oh sure he 's slightly bigger as an adult and slightly smaller as a kid but it 's very subtle . The music is the one area where the game succeeds quite amazingly however . All the theme songs are not only appropriate for the environments , but melodic and memorable . Several dungeon themes are well-made and believably chilling and haunting . The right ingredients were definitely put into the music-making aspect of the game . The Hyrule overworld theme is enjoyable too and wo n't get on your nerves despite all the time you will undoubtedly spend there.The dungeons are either incredibly simplistic with strategies that involve the overbearingly dull and overused crate-pushing to open up portals or switches , or hopelessly generic `` I 'm stuck in a maze and I ca n't get out '' frustration that is an inconvenient trademark of early 3D game design . But ... these are n't any ordinary mazes . These are mazes where your surroundings look identical around every turn , hence the flawed early 3D game design . A cheap way of making a maze seem more difficult than it has to be , or in other words , needlessly difficult chores instead of exciting castle exploration which is what made the 2D Zelda 's so memorable . Sometimes you have to light torches with arrows or by other means , and quite often you have to collect 5 silver rupees to activate a switch/open a door . Collecting these silver rupees is WAY too similar to Super Mario 64 with the red coins . The Lost Woods is a tunnel-infested maze with no personality whatsoever . The Lost Woods -if you plan on getting everything the game has to offer- will most definitely be the source of endless frustration.The enemies , or rather , what little enemies you will stumble upon on your `` adventure '' through the temples , is probably the most aggravating part of the entire game . These dungeons are sorely in need of something to spice them up and make them pleasurable . You will often go 3 or 4 rooms at a time without seeing a single enemy . Why even have a sword ? In the 2D games the idea was simple- just load or overload the rooms with a variety of enemies and , guess what ? *Now* the dungeons are exciting . A genius idea really . Here ? In Ocarina of Time ? It 's all about atmosphere . It 's all about featuring as little opposing danger as possible so you can absorb what was once Nintendo 's most recent creation back in 1998 . But ... Nintendo forgot to take into account that technology will inevitably advance and a game relying on atmosphere above everything else will eventually suffer and become inferior one day . What was once a brand new puppy in 1998 is now a tired old dog thanks to the surroundings being boring and incredibly basic in their design . Video game technology is destined to advance making a game like this completely forgettable . That 's exactly what has happened with Ocarina of Time- it has n't stood the test of time.Do you really think those poorly animated mechanical blue tektite spiders in the water dungon are worthy of a Zelda game ? Seriously ? Their animations are so stiff due to the Nintendo 64 's limitations as a console that it 's unbearable to deal with them and laughable at the way they lunge towards Link . But even then , *most* dungeon enemies fall way short of acceptable . Big Skulltula is a laughably bland attempt at being dangerous- it 's more like a nuisance when one of these comes down out of nowhere while you 're running around . The spikes that roll around are incredibly basic and uninteresting . Somehow *all* the enemies manage to never once be memorable . Ever ! Ocarina of Time has dated horrendously , seriously . Wolfos are unintetionally funny with their choppy movements and the dated howling sounds they make , Red Bubble is basically the same thing as Big Skulltula but on fire , and Gibdos are boring . The ReDead 's let out a hilarious scream that freezes Link in place which is inconvenient when you 're trying to get up the ladder right in front of you and even more inconvenient when you 're stuck in a room with two of them . Mummies are poorly designed since all you have to do is hookshot them , run behind them , and slice them with your sword . To be fair , some enemies are cool such as Deku Baba where it 's best to snap its vine with the sword for an instant kill- creatively well done there . The Deku Scrub where you can block or sword swipe its shooting seeds with the shield and ricochet the seeds back at them is neat . And the Lizalfos and Dinalfos basically serve as mini bosses due to being somewhat harder and more sophisticated than the other ordinary enemies.The game overall has a shortage of rupees . They 're really not that important which is odd . This is the first Zelda game I 've ever played where rupees feel more like an afterthought . Not something to take real seriously . If you do n't feel like collecting them , then don't- no harm done . The bosses are alright except for the irritating one in the water dungeon . You have to repeatedly hookshot him while standing next to the platform . It takes FOREVER ( and no , this boss is *nowhere* as fun as the water dungeon in Link to the Past in case you 're wondering ) . The hookshot is used MORE than the sword throughout the game because it serves as an effective weapon quite often . The hookshot is a highly recommended weapon to use in a variety of situations , but especially important when collecting these things called gold skulltulas . After you collect 10 gold skulltula tokens , you get a beneficial reward . You can only collect them after defeating the gold skulltula enemy ( usually found on walls ) . I admit I love the witches you face in the Spirit Temple . While the temple itself is really short and boring , it 's probably worth going through it so you can face the two witches that make for a rather entertaining boss fight . You have to use your shield to reflect shots at the *other* witch , and it 's really fun and creative . The hookshot 's basically a required item to properly deal with hard-shelled or spiked enemies in the dungeons and it 's annoying that it 's used WAY more frequently than the sword throughout the game . Due to how much precision is required to use the hookshot , using this item becomes a very tedious chore after a while ( especially if you keep missing your target ) and it slows down the pace of the game by a lot.If you have n't noticed yet , the water dungeon in Ocarina of Time is just abominable . I bring it up often to remind people how terrible a dungeon can be in every possible way . Also , the worst influence ever occurs here- the importance of playing the ocarina musical instrument for a variety of reasons ( mostly for warping from one place to another ) . Nintendo really overdid this aspect of the game by implementing the ocarina WAY too many darn times . It 's overdone . Just hurry up and play the darn song and move on for goodness sake . Do n't make it so you have to play the ocarina up to 50 times , if not more . I never really counted how many times I used it . It was a lot . It severely drags the gameplay , atmosphere and excitement down and immediately drags the game to a screeching halt having to frequently stop and play these songs on the ocarina . Watching Link stand around and play the instrument is the fruitiest thing I 've ever seen . No wonder people think Nintendo makes nothing but kids games these days . This game is partly responsible for that belief due to its influence.Ganon 's castle is supposed to be exhilarating and suspenseful . It 's supposed to be filled with dangerous traps , tricky puzzles and enemies all over the place . But ... the one in Ocarina of Time falls way short of being presentable by normal Legend of Zelda standards . Instead the castle is dominated with mini quests where you have to go through 6 trials to dispel the main barrier . The problem is that each trial contains really simple and short rooms where you only spend a couple minutes in each one performing the same tasks that you already had to do in the previous dungeons such as collecting 5 silver rupees . This is the complete opposite of being overwhelmingly threatening . Another bonus point for Link to the Past . Oh and the Ganon fight ? His strategy is stolen from Agahnim 's battle from Link to the Past but takes SEVERAL more minutes to bring down . Remember how you fought Agahnim ? Yup , same exact strategy but in a 3D world . Sigh . The second part of the Ganon fight ( after a looooong and tedious time-based departure from the top of a castle ) is to shoot arrows at Ganon and hit his glowing behind several times . It 's really easy , all of it . However fighting him in one of the early dungeons ( Forest Temple ) is actually one of the most memorable in the entire Zelda series . This is because Ganon rides a horse in and out of these picture frames hanging on the wall making for a VERY unique graphics effect and perhaps an original concept . Reminds me of a Harry Potter movie.A few other complaints . Fishing is sort of fun but nothing really noteworthy . It 's better than most fishing games I 've played in other games I admit . Expect to be sitting and fishing a while in order to get the heart piece however . Most heart pieces are pretty challenging to acquire and take some serious effort to get most of them . That 's a rare compliment I can give . Some of the other mini games such as riding a horse and shooting targets is pretty fun . I do n't really like that part in the desert where you have to follow a ghost through a dust storm . If you fall behind even a *little* bit you 'll lose . Performing this same ghost-chasing task earlier in the game in order to obtain the hookshot is more exciting since you 're dodging fireballs . The other task earlier on in the game in the Ice Cavern that involves throwing blue fire over red fire is really overlong and entirely puzzle-based . Having to do this once or twice would have been suitable- not 15-20 times . This particular place is a victim of platforms that are basic and uninteresting.Basically , when compared to the 2D games , Ocarina of Time only feels like half a game due to the dramatic change of turning the Zelda series into 3D but only giving us a small portion of what 's available in Link to the Past . As a result the game feels incomplete on too many occasions . It 's because the Nintendo 64 is a limited console that 's really only able to handle so much . Ocarina of Time comes up way short . Even the first couple hours are disappointing since it takes forever to actually get going . Avoiding being detected by guards is n't fun after the first time . Oh and speaking of avoiding detection- this game actually has a Metal Gear Solid stealth-style mission later on where you have to free these imprisoned carpenter people . The stealth is so underutilized and simplistic that this is the second biggest chore in the game next to the water dungeon . Equally annoying is upon freeing the 4 carpenters , these red sword-swinging enemies appear on screen . The SAME EXACT ENEMY 4 times in a row with *no* differences between any of them . At first these battles seem hard until you realize all you really have to do is lunge your sword directly at them about 5 times , and they fall over and die.Reading text and having boring discussions with Zelda , trees and other semi-interesting characters does n't get the job done either . Ganon even seems significantly less threatening than usual ( that one conversation with Zelda and Link with Ganon patrolling the hallways nearby in Hyrule Castle comes to mind here ) . I will admit that some of the flame-covered cutscenes involving Ganon riding his horse is very intimidating . The cutscene outside the bridge of Hyrule Castle comes to mind here . Otherwise , Ganon 's presented uninterestingly . You 're *supposed* to get a feeling of hopelessness that Ganon is going to take over the world and wipe the people out but ... due to a culmination of the above mentioned problems , Ganon being a ruthless villain does n't ever materialize ( at least , he 's not as scary as he *should* be ) .Recognize Ocarina of Time for making the 3D Zelda series exist . That 's fair . It allowed Wind Waker to eventually be created which in turn made the 3D Zelda formula better starting from that game until now . By 2003 Nintendo was working with the technologically superior Gamecube console which allowed the Zelda series to be fully realized in all major categories ( gameplay , graphics , replay value and excitement ) . I say avoid Ocarina of Time but hey , nobody will listen or agree with me anyway so carry on and have a wonderful day !	-1
Seriously , this ranks up with some of the worst games I have ever played . It is a complete insult to anyone who respects the RPG genre as this is nothing more than a linear , cutesy , puzzle game . You run around playing a little harmonica by pressing certain buttons in certain orders and the rest of the time you are moving boxes around , jumping from platform to platform , and killing enemies ( with an awful targeting system ) that respawn as soon as you leave the room.I can guarantee that about 95 % of all the 4 and 5 star votes are coming from children under the age of 15 as this is the type of game that would appeal to them . But if you are an older , more experienced gamer do yourself a favor and steer clear from this hideous example of a good title gone bad.If you 'll excuse me I am going to balance out my wobbly kitcken table with the cartridge .	-1
Seriously , it 's one of the worst games ever ! Terrible graphics , especially compared to the PS Triple 's , no voice acting , boring puzzles , and above all , it stars a little fruity fairy boy who wears green panties and never hits on any of the babes in this game . Plus why is the main villian black ? That 's racist ! For a good Zelda game , I recommend Link : The Faces of Evil , The Wand of Gamelon , or Zelda 's Adventure .	-1
There 's many that love this so-called masterpiece , but the only thing I like about this boring/repetitive game is the great soundtrack . Sticking to the superior original .	-1
Miyamoto slacked off on this one.1.This is certainly not the best game ever . Not even the best game on Nintendo 64 . Super Mario 64 , and Perfect Dark both stomp this game into submission.2.This is not a role-playing game . Role-playing games have a lot of text and character involvement . This game has a script that is about two pages long , maybe less . What you say or do in this game really has no effect on the games out come.3.This is not the best Zelda game . The Legend Of Zelda , Links Awakening , and A Link To The Past are all much better games , especially for their time.4.This game is not 256 Mega Bytes . It is actually 256 Mega Bits , which is equal to 32 Mega Bytes . So sorry the game is n't nearly the size of a 650/700 Mega Byte CD-ROM.5.The game has no replay value , I played through it once , then about a year later , I attempted playing through it again , I could n't bare it , the game is just too boring . I played through Final Fantasy VII and VIII twice each , and those took alot longer than this to finish , they were both great both times through.I loved the good old Zelda games but this just does n't deserve the Zelda name , lets just hope that Zelda on the Game Cube does n't turn out the same way .	-1
Lara Croft games have NEVER been any good . I remember when the very first one came out 10 years ago . Teens were practically DROOLING on their controller every time they saw Lara 's pretty face . Tomb Raider must have been advertised like it was the most groundbreaking video game to ever hit the freakin ' market . The thing is , the games are boring and Lara Croft is n't very pretty.If polygon-breasted girls are your thing , go for it . But they are n't MY thing , and I know I 'm not the only one to think so . Lara Croft is n't good-looking to the millions of internet gamers who understand that a blocky-looking computer babe is n't going to automatically make a game any fun to play . I 'll give Lara Croft SOME credit . She was one of the originators of the `` running around half-naked female shooter/adventure '' type of video games . In fact , you might even say she was a MAJOR influence because soon after her very first adventure , more and more game companies were making the main characters in their games half-naked chicks . Lara brought something new to the world of video games and I will give her credit for that.Sometimes influence does n't matter when a game is really bad . This is one of those cases . The Tomb Raider series on the original Playstation is a joke . I absolutely *groan* when I think about playing a Tomb Raider game because I remember how ugly and dark the environments are , the glitchy problems that dominate all three Tomb Raider games , the annoying and difficult jumping style of Lara Croft ( which makes it nearly impossible to progress to the end of the game . Good luck- she NEVER jumps where you want her to ) and of course , mentioned above , Lara 's supposed beautiful face ( she 's NOT pretty , remember ? ) It also does n't help that the puzzles you have to solve are ALWAYS really awful ( and appear frequently ) and , because of the jumping problem , very frustrating to complete . Trying to aim your gun at an emeny is n't exactly a walk in the park , either . The whole series has been an overrated disaster up to this point.By the time Tomb Raider 3 was released people were REALLY getting fed up with the series . Now , these same people will tell you this was because they kept releasing more and more Tomb Raider games , but I actually think people got sick of Tomb Raider because games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill came along with a similar style and improved on it *drastically* , making Tomb Raider look awfully dated by comparison.At least the third Tomb Raider game has SOME decent-looking background levels . I guess the company who created Lara Croft finally understood that Lara 's pretty face ALONE is n't going to get the job done anymore . I mean , at least in some places the backgrounds LOOK good . Not exactly the prettiest environments available on the Playstation of course , and most of the time all you see is darkness or candlelight . But what 's THERE is okay to look at , at least.Tomb Raider 3 features a challenge that is mostly only challenging because of the above-mentioned jumping problem . She simply does n't jump the way you want her to . You 'd THINK the game company would 've dealt with this problem with all the new moves for Lara they added to the game , but no , none of these new moves make the game any easier . The artifact-finding storyline had potential but unfortunately the frustrating challenge ruined it.BOY am I glad I never bought any of these games ( all these years I 've been watching OTHER people play them ) . Reading reviews for the more recent Tomb Raider games on the Playstation 2 , I see NO improvements have been made . Let the series END already .	-1
If you like the story then get this . For me , multiplayer is where it counts and I have more fun with Rage Wars . FRAG TAG IS AWESOME ! !	-1
Twisted Metal 3 is overrated - because it 's not normally considered the worst Playstation game . I ca n't believe how unfun this game is . The control is laughable . The gameplay is incredibly boring . The music is Rob Zombie , which is bad enough before you hear it 5,000 times in a row . The game also adds almost nothing new . Do n't even rent this one .	-1
The main reason that people hate this game is because it came right after Twisted Metal 2 and people were expecting A LOT of improvement , but the expectations were in vain . : ( The game is n't all THAT bad , I mean ... Mr. Grimm still cool , there is a new Viper car , you can use `` rain missiles '' as weapons , some of the characters and stories are VERY funny , the graphics were improved , the Rob Zombie intro song was AWESOME , and the London , Spaceship and Blimp stages were GREAT.NOW ! The reason that this game suck 's is because EVERYTHING in the game looks like fake plastic , the special effects are NOT shocking at all , you ca n't make ANY massive explosion or massive destruction , many characters look lame , if your car turns upside down you have to wait for 5 seconds for your car to stand up , and many stages are VERY small.P.S : This Twisted Metal sequel is terrible , but at least is NOT GARBAGE as Twisted Metal 4 ! ! ! That game was n't even a Twisted Metal game , that was more like `` The Circus War '' . X ( Adios .	-1
Having played the Twisted Metal series for a few years now , I can honestly say that Twisted Metal III , while having an initial gleam at first play , it wears itself out fairly quickly . The gleam I 'm speaking of is the slick graphics and the incredibly different game play . It tries to be something new , which it is , but it improves in all the wrong ways.Allow me to explain : Weapons Inventory . Instead of a max capacity of the total number of weapons in your inventory , you are limited to how many of each weapon you can have . For example , I can pick up 10 homing missiles but no more . The rest of my inventory has to be stocked with other useless weapons like Speed Missiles ( more on that in a bit ) . In previous TM installments , you could keep building your homing missile capacity , and carry only those , as long as you did n't exceed the max capacity . Annoying.New Weapons . Okay , so initially I thought the ( ( ( Rain Missile ) ) ) was the best thing since sliced bread . But really , the rain missile does n't do very much apart from visual appeal . The missile shoots into the air and you detonate it , and a ring of fire falls down like five mini-napalms . It does n't do the damage the napalm does , but only allows the cars to drive through so they start on fire ... at least until they turbo ( stop-drop-and-roll in TM maneuvers ) out of it 2 seconds later . Minimal damage done.The introduction of the ( ( ( Speed missile ) ) ) was the worst mistake of the weapon category . It 's a fast missile that has the strength of three machine gun bullets . If you can fire them fast , you can do some damage , but they 're so useless during combat that it really does n't even matter . ( ( ( Remotes ) ) ) are plenty but do much less damage than in TM2 . ( ( ( Freeze missiles ) ) ) ( the left-right-up maneuver ) do not hit enemies like they used to . It is much harder to freeze an enemy . This can be frustrating.Enemies . New characters are added , some are great , some not so great . Your enemies now have the A.I . that allows them to steal items from in front of you . If they need health , they will race you for it and take the health . This is especially frustrating when you are fighting Minion and you have one shot left to kill him and he quickly finds full health . *Cue controller hitting floor*The levels are not very large . Not much scenery and not much to discover . There 's a few hidden places you can find to explore , but for the most part it 's very limited.All in all , TM3 falls flat . The previous installments are much better both in game-play value , and in overall playability.If you can find this cheap , get it . Otherwise pass it up .	-1
Trust me , Do not buy this game . I am the local TM lover and know-all . I bought TM4 , TM2 , and TM3 ( sadly I ca n't find a copy of TM1 ) After i bought TM2 , I was looking forward to cool characters , cool battlegrounds , and semi-pixated graphics . I found none of these things . There are only 4 new characters , Club Kid , Auger , Flamethrower , and my favorite new driver , Flower Power . The levels , especially Washington DC , is a small open level , which is no fun . The North Pole is annoying , and I hate the boring London level . The graphics are cheesy , and 989 studios tried to make them look too real . The cars flip over with every tight turn you make , when another car hits you , or you drive onto a hill . This game is not realistic . This game should have 0 stars and is a disgrace to the TM title . I warn you , do not even look at this game . It is the worst . The car combat genre is in shame .	-1
To this very day I still can not understand why everyone loves Tomb Raider so much . Aside from the odd improvement here and there , the games have n't changed vastly ( I think Doom to Quake is vastly ) at all . I find controlling Lara very clumsey , the 3rd person view not help . Plus , Lara does all the aiming so the satisfaction of blasting something 's head off from a distance is non-existent . I found myself fart around half the time . Where 's the fun in climbing up a rock face ? I 'm all for puzzles but I find these games boring and labourious . Oh , and Lara Croft is not fit because she 's not real and if she was she 'd fall forwards due to her massive mammaries . So stop ogling at your screen , you sad people !	-1
I recently tried playing this game , and by this point , my N64 is lucky it did n't get chucked out the window . The first few passes through the first few stages were fine , and pretty fun , but the rest of the game ends up being one long , annoying , tedious , impossible , and frustrating chore.To start off , the control just is n't good enough to pull off HALF the things you need to do in this game . There are instances where you must execute specific jumps to get you from point A to point B , but half the time , the controller is non-responsive . Especially when it comes to levels that put you high up , this usually means falling ... over and OVER again ! To add to this annoyance is the fact that there are no check points . If a level requires you to go to the top of a mountain , and you spend half an hour just getting up there and then you fall , you have to climb the whole thing ALL OVER AGAIN ! So if you 're like me , and find your self wondering off cliffs every other try because of the awful camera work , you will be playing the same stages over and over with no payoff but one big headache ! Now let 's talk about the camera . Throughout most of the game , I found my self fighting IT more than I fought Bowser . It 's simply impossible to judge distances based on where the camera is facing at any given time . Pressing the C buttons will move it around , but you have to keep perfectly still in order to avoid suddenly gong sideways or backwards . If you are in a stage where there is a time limit or a complicated jump , this can be particularly fatal.Adding to this frustration is the fact that it is incredibly easy to over or under jump ! This would n't be as much of a problem if it were n't for all the levels which require you to get to `` the top '' of things . Again , if you fall once , that 's it , you start all over again . If the game designers were n't going to give you any continue points in these levels , why-o-why did they make it SO FRIGGIN ' EASY FOR YOU TO FALL ! ! ! ? ? ? There are plenty of levels and stages in this game , and lots to do in all of them . But by the time I cleared one stage , I really questioned whether or not I wanted to even GO to the next . Finally , after reaching a mere 52 stars , my answer is no.So that 's my two cents on this game , I ca n't beat it , I do n't want to beat it . I 'd rather go to a Morrissey concert with Kathy Griffin as the opening act than try to play it again . It would me MUCH less annoying than this game !	-1
I 'm pretty sick and tired of people calling Super Mario 64 a classic . It 's not . Just because it 's significant and influential in helping pave the way for future Mario titles does n't mean Super Mario 64 is deserving of its classic status , or that it 's any fun to actually play . Super Mario Galaxy came along and pretty much improved every single aspect of Super Mario 64 so you basically no longer have to play this game other than to get a dated taste of mid 90 's gaming history . The only other possible reason someone would play Super Mario 64 is because they desperately seek open world exploration , and this is basically the only Mario platformer that can at least attempt to satisfy gamers with that particular appetite . Not that I personally believe the game succeeds at the exploring aspect either.The biggest problem is that so much of the land you explore consists of emptiness . Oh sure you 'll see trees , ramps , castles , buildings , enemies such as goombas , chain chomps , badly and laughably animated thwomps lifting up and slamming down , pokeys , rolling boulders , and other things that have become a trademark of the Mario series , but the amount of items to find and collect is *extremely* limited to coins ( both yellow and red ones ) and the occasional power-up that enables Mario to either fly ( which admittedly is pretty fun ) or obtain the incredibly boring metal cap that makes Mario invincible . An alternative to the starman perhaps , with lousy side effects ( Mario ca n't jump as high or far while wearing the metal cap ) .When you 're not experiencing the endless disappointment that is running across empty and boring lands and basically doing nothing but wasting time , you 're jumping across a series of unspectacular and very ordinary-presented platforms over and *over* again . This stuff seriously resembles a beginners course for developing platforms . It 's extremely basic game design . The platforms are generic square-shaped tiles for you to jump across that quite often are all the same exact size . It gets monotonous almost immediately . Only unreasonable Nintendo fans would eat this stuff up , seriously . Anybody else would obviously be able to detect flawed , repetitive gameplay . The 2D Mario games move at such a swift pace that you do n't even have time to stop and notice the platforms ( unless you 're an extremely slow gamer ) . This is mainly because you do n't have to stop and situate Mario a certain way for the purpose of making the perfect jump which is what severely ruins Super Mario 64 's gameplay . And do n't EVEN say my skills are horrible when it 's obvious through countless youtube videos that several gamers have the same exact issue.While I 'm by no means someone who cares about the best graphics available , you got ta admit the ones here have dated horrendously with embarrassing blocky shapes pretty much occupying most areas of the game . The buildings , water and trees in particular are just awful for the eyes . Nothing appealing whatsoever about any of the graphics- even the bright inviting colors do n't lure me in but rather rub me the wrong way and force some of us older gamers to recall the unpleasant days of Mario Paint.You have to collect 120 stars in order to complete the game 100 % but guess what ? Many of the stars are flat out boring to collect due to being pathetically easy and basically being handed to you within minutes . What kind of challenge is that ? The one where you have to swim around and open treasure chests in a certain order is baby-ish , and the one where you swim around collecting 8 predictably located red coins inside a basic building near the beginning of the game is offensive . Or how about simply stomping a post into a ground to release a gate and thus , release the star ? Do n't even *think* about mentioning the ones where you walk up to Toad and he simply hands you the star . Granted , the game seems to always alternate easy star-collecting challenges with longer and more drawn out ones as a way to balance things out but that 's the problem- the stars are either too easy or too long . There is one star mission so awful it makes your inevitable death seem like something to anticipate- the one where you have to jump across a series of moving poles . You have to jump at *just* the right moment while making sure you 're positioned in the right spot . This takes forever and is dreadfully annoying.Also , what 's up with all the little baby games ? Grab a baby penguin and slide down a snowy hill ? Chase the bunny so he does n't hop away ? These are not suitable for anyone who recalls the challenging portions of previous 2D gaming such as Super Mario Bros. 3 or Super Mario World ( and yes , these bunny grabbing missions are flaws in Super Mario Galaxy too , in case you think I 'm intentionally favoring Super Mario Galaxy for no reason ) . At least the cannon-shooting parts are cool . It 's fun figuring out where to launch Mario so he can land safely on upper grounds.I ca n't help but feel the red star collecting is overrated . When you collect red stars in Yoshi 's Island , you feel like you 're given a really elaborate and perfectly executed assignment since you also have to collect flowers and stars to 100 % complete a stage . It 's a lot to do not to mention really darn exciting and satisfying once you 've acquired all these items , and constantly keeps your attention span in check while searching for them . Super Mario 64 basically takes that one red coin-collecting element of Yoshi 's Island and makes it a main priority here . You often have to collect 8 red coins per stage ( opposed to 20 in Yoshi 's Island ) to obtain one of the 120 stars . Ugh.But nothing NOTHING is worse than the fact you have to re-enter stages over and over again just to grab all the stars that are located throughout . To me this is unquestionably lazy game design . How can it be anything else ? Who in their right mind would actually *want* to keep going back to the same exact stage ad nauseam ? Super Mario World was guilty of this too granted but not NEARLY to this exaggerated extent . A terrible idea that gives a false impression a game has replay value but it 's exactly the opposite- once you go through the same stage a bunch of times and finally accomplish everything there is to offer , you wo n't want to repeat these same objectives ever again . So ... you probably wo n't want to play Super Mario 64 ever again . Even worse- when you often have to search for 100 coins to obtain a star . This can take up to 20 minutes and bore you the entire time . Being forced to collect 100 coins is a lazy way of assuring gamers do n't leave any stone unturned because you basically have to thoroughly search every nook and cranny of a stage to even *find* 100 of them.I also dislike how many of the classic enemies are n't included here such as the hammer brothers , buzzy beetles , bloopers , and cheep cheeps . Even the koopa troopa is nowhere to be seen ( well , other than that one race in the beginning ) . You can ride a koopa shell like a skateboard but that does n't count as an enemy appearance . He 's not a true enemy here . Why is that ? Why not include all the familiar and well-loved enemies that have become a trademark to the Mario series ? They ruin the pirahna plants by the way . Why is he sleeping ? Granted he comes alive when you get near , but it 's a really weird concept . At least Nintendo got the boos and haunted house right- a surprising and exciting maze-like high point of the game . It 's a lot of fun sorting through each room of the haunted house stages . *That's* how you design a memorable stage . Obviously if you were n't busy running around through several vast and average-designed empty fields of grass , there could have EASILY been room for the inclusion of more enemies . Hey I 'm all for open world exploration , but you have to actually fill in those areas with exciting , creative items that are both fun and rewarding to collect for the player , and enemies that present threatening encounters and a rush of excitement . Simply throwing Mario into a big 3D world because it 's his first grand 3D adventure truthfully is n't going to get the job done I 'm afraid . More needs to be done.Constantly having to rearrange the camera so you can see where you 're actually going is a nuisance . Nobody likes dealing with a camera while jumping around trying to play a video game , but granted , several games back in the mid to late 90 's were guilty of the same camera problems since developers were still getting their feet wet so to speak , and figuring out the best way to help players accurately and conveniently see what 's ahead . Still , you 'll lose more than a few lives due to bad camera angles in Super Mario 64 . I guarantee it . One thing I *do* like about this game is how fast Mario runs . It 's a fast-moving game , which helps going from point A to point B more convenient . Also some of the wall jumps and triple jumps are fun to execute . Reminds me of Super Metroid in that respect . Yoshi is teased in this game ( I wo n't spoil how ) but he 's not actually playable which does n't make sense . Why make an appearance if he 's not going to be playable ? The music is either extremely good ( the brilliant peaceful moodiness of the water theme and the intimidating and exciting heavy metal-like Bowser fights ) or downright horrendous ( everything else , which consists of annoying nursery rhyme children 's themes inappropriate and painfully skull-smashing for the rest of us ) . I ca n't STAND the theme songs that play in Whomp 's Fortress and Rainbow Ride- two unforgivable themes that make me want to smash my brains in whenever I play Super Mario Galaxy 2 where they return in all their overbearingly annoying glory . Rainbow Ride in particular reminds me of a county hayride where kids ride around on tractors ( not to mention the stage itself is extremely tedious and overlong ) . The snowy mountain stage with the Italian accordion music is sickening and out of place . Just mute the volume on your TV to make life easier for yourself . The boss fights are incredibly simplistic- grab Bowser 's tail , spin him around and toss him , or pick up/stomp other bosses . Basic , boring stuff.A few stages that are actually fun include Lethal Lava Land where the platforms convincingly feel like an upgrade into the 3D world from the original Super Mario Bros. castle levels ( not to mention better/more interesting use of platform jumping compared to the rest of the levels in SM64 ) , Shifting Sand Land since it 's packed with obstacles and enemies ( and reasonably challenging overall ) , and Tall Tall Mountain 's tricky climb to the top ( involving a vine climbing portion ) . In fact , to be fair , Tall Tall Mountain is one of the best levels ever in a 3D Mario game . It 's *that* good . Bowser 's castle levels are pretty solid as well , mostly due to the fast-paced nature of them.Several things feel tacky- the 1-ups and coins are small , dark , ugly looking , and clumsily made due to less than spectacular graphics and game design , and overall Super Mario 64 is just a really lackluster and highly overrated game . If not for influence , this game would have been forgotten and the superior Super Mario Galaxy series would have prevailed even more dominantly than they already do . Oh and do n't even mention the cake-eating storyline . It 's atrocious . The fact they brought it back for the Galaxy series makes me want to vomit .	-1
Let me just say that i think mario 64 is a okay game as far as gameplay and graphics goes but , every level get 's harder and harder it 's so hard it would take you months to beat it and by the time you do you would be white as a sheet from staying inside all the time and 50 % of your muscles would atrophy . also the ending really sucks it ends by princess toadstool saying let 's make a cake for mario then it 's over so do n't waste your time with this game .	-1
Even when it first came out I tried out this game but could not get into it and I hate the n64 old style 3d graphics where the camera angle ends up getting you killed every five seconds , espessially in pits . Of all the Mario games to date including the amazing Wii titles except for Super Mario Wii this has to be the worst Mario game for me since Mario Nes . The graphics are terrible , the music is annoying and it 's just boaring .	-1
I 'll admit right now that I hate all of the Simcities that came out , with the exception of the Super Nintendo version of the first Simcity . I 'm more of an action person , not a sit-back-and-watch-my-city-grow person . Sure , Simcity 3000 is good for a while with it 's catchy graphics and innovative approach to buidling a city , but a few hours later , you 'll either want to fall asleep or put your fist through the monitor , depending upon whether the income for your city is positive or negative for each game year . I turned out to be one of the latter people . No matter how hard I tried , I could never get the income to come out positive . So , I did what any distraught and stuck person would do ... go online for cheat codes ! An hour later , I was bored . If you 're a thinker , by all means try Simcity 3000 out . But , if you 're a person that thinks actions speak louder than words , try Dungeon Keeper 2 , a game like Simcity 3000 , but not as complex ( and more active ! ) .	-1
I love Sim . games very much but I did not like this Sim . game . After I would have my little city all set up I would need to watch it like a hawk leaving me with almost no time to expand and improve on my little city . I have been told to give this game another try but I just can not find a reason to go back and try this game again .	-1
the only SHUMP on the 64 i figured i 'd check it out ... it plays like a genesis game with crude 3D backgrounds . not very interesting to look at . if you want SHUMP there 's only one system for you and it 's called the dreamcast . this one you can pass on .	-1
This Game Is n't Very Exciting.I Do n't Like This Game.It 's Boring .What You Do In This Game Is Try To Go Through Boring Levels That Do n't Look Very Detailed.I Warn You.You Wo n't Like This Game.I Warn You.Do n't Pick This Up.This Game Is Really Old And Just Such A Bad Game .	-1
This game was very poorly made ... it 's really boring , because all you do is walk around and throw stuff at things . All the enemies are exactly the same , there 's never any health , and 100 health points are n't enough , because the health goes down too fast . The sight of range is ridiculous because half the screen is nothing but fog , and it all just draws in as you walk ahead , making it hard to see enemies . I do like seeing the familiar South Park characters in 3D , the game is very funny , and the weapons are hilarious ! But still , I would n't buy it . Rent at most .	-1
I only gave this game 2 stars because if you 're die-hard South Park fan , it 's possible that you might enjoy this game ... but I like South Park , and I HATED it . The controls are IMPOSSIBLE to use ( you have to use the C buttons most of the time ) , the gameplay is repetitive and boring ( all you do is walk around throwing snowballs at turkeys ) , and the multiplayer part is boring too . One pro is that the guns are pretty original & amp ; the South Park kids say some funny things , but the novelty wears off after a while . I bought this game when it first came out , for ... , and I sold it for $ 5 at a stoop sale ... I just wanted to get rid of it , it 's really that bad . If you really have to get it , at least rent it first .	-1
Konami took a bold step into 3-D with this Castlevania installment for the 64 . Unfortunately , it did n't live up to expectations , which part of it is because it was n't the same people ( believe it or not ) that did Symphony of the Night ( PSX ) . Read on to see why it 's a below average game : THE GOODFinally , Castlevania in 3-D ! Despite many shortcomings , the game does have some eerie music and a dark atmosphere , which are characteristic of a Castlevania game ( at least the newer releases ) . You can select between two characters ( Carrie and Reinhart ) that change the storyline somewhat.THE BADI was never a fan of the 64 controller and this is the one game where it hurt most . The controls and gameplay were difficult at best , and normally I have a decent tolerance level for controls ; Here 's where I absolutely loathed it . Getting your character to go where you want is quite a challenge for this game . Also , the storyline , aside from the two characters ' different ( yet similar ) paths , is really hollow at its core and does n't add anything new to the Castlevania legacy.OVERALLNot recommended . I advise renting the game only . ONLY BUY IT IF YOU ARE A DIE-HARD N64 FAN . Otherwise , I strongly recommend skipping it . I 'm a big Castlevania fan and I feel that this game does not do the series justice . I noticed some people in their reviews that they liked this game over Bloodlines ( Genesis ) ; Why ? ! Bloodlines had far better gameplay and replay value than this ! Perhaps it 's because 90 % of gamers today prefer graphics over gameplay , when it 's GAMEPLAY that creates the game .	-1
game came on time and works . This game is pretty bad in my opinion I would stick to the 2d whipping action if your looking for fun . You choose from 2 pretty lame characters , camera angles are no good and the gameplay it 's self is not great . Get this game to add to your collection but other then that this game is a waste of energy .	-1
There 's a lot of hype surrounding the Resident Evil series of games . They 're on most systems , there are books , and even a movie . The story is a good one , but I found the game to not be so great . Graphics are alright , the sound is bad though . And game play is horrible . Trying to move around is difficult and can be confusing , especially when you 're under attack and things are chaotic . The characters move unlike most games . You do n't go in the direction of the D-pad , rather you turn with right and left direction and move with a button . It was poorly designed . But since the Playstation 2 is out , and better games as well as more Resident Evil , there 's no reason to pick up this game anymore . The 2-disc set here is one adventure with a male character and another with a female . The game is involved , just not as much fun as it shoud be	-1
Was n't the very first Crash Bandicoot game supposed to become one of the all-time greatest Playstation games ? That 's what Sony thought would happen back in the day . After all , they promoted the game to death . Well look at that ... did n't happen ! And with good reason . The game is horrible . I ca n't believe ANYONE would prefer this junk over Sonic the Hedgehog or , especially , the Mario Bros. series.You have to give Sony a LOT of credit for all the attention they put into Crash Bandicoot in an attempt to put the game on the same extraordinary level as Mario and Sonic , but gamers never really caught on to Crash the same way . When you think about it , the Playstation already HAD a huge selection of games to choose from around the time Crash was released , therefore Sony did n't even NEED a mascot . People were buying Playstation games like crazy anyway ! Crash Bandicoot never even had to exist.You 'd think for a debut game ( a BIG debut , considering all the advertisements on TV commercials ) Sony would have made the game a *little* easier for younger or inexperienced gamers to play . Instead , Sony started off the Crash series with impossible bonus levels ( impossible to complete AND find- I did n't even KNOW the game had bonus levels until I looked it up in the instruction booklet ! ) Even if you ignore the bonus levels , the challenge overall is pretty high anyway thanks to all the difficult stages ( such as the one where you 're crossing a bridge way up in the sky and continue falling through the wooden cracks- a NIGHTMARE of a level ! ) All the lives you earned up to this point in the game will go away . A mascot debut game should n't have the difficulty THIS high because the idea is for players of ALL ages to enjoy the game . Children will not like the nonstop frustration.I think the biggest reason Crash Bandicoot is n't remembered today the same way Mario and Sonic 's debut games are is because Crash is basically just a blend of Mario and Sonic , but featured in a 3D world . Think about it . Crash collects berries throughout the game ( Mario collects coins , Sonic collects rings ) . Crash has a spin attack ( Mario and Sonic already had spin attacks YEARS before Crash 's existence ) . Sony just did n't have enough creative ideas to come up with something entirely different , and that 's why most gamers tend to ignore Crash Bandicoot . When you already have the best ( Mario and Sonic ) you do n't need imitations.Crash Bandicoot may have improved later on ( not enough of an improvement to earn its mascot reputation , however ) but the series certainly did NOT start with a bang . I will always remember the very first Crash Bandicoot game as being this uninteresting , frustrating experience . Heck , just the fact that only 62 reviewers have submitted reviews for the game right here on amazon goes to show Crash Bandicoot 's first adventure was meant to be gone and forgotten . Add to the fact that right now in the year 2006 NO ONE is talking about ANY Crash Bandicoot game anymore . This means you can ignore Crash Bandicoot entirely , and not really miss out on anything .	-1
this game is pretty bad first off all you can do is run strait the only good thing about is its pretty long the other bad thing is its to hard and it gets boring i wouldnt buy this game if you want a crash bandicoot game get either 2,3,4 .	-1
Naughty Dog and Sony released Crash Bandicoot , which rivaled the likes of Mario and Sonic . In the end , many gamers liked Crash 's non-stop action , but others simply just skipped it . Even though it was very promising , Crash 's gameplay did not really offer anything new , which featured elements you can find in a 16-bit platformer.You play as Crash , whose girlfriend is kidnapped by Dr. Neo Cortex . You basically just run through the levels from start to finish and fight bosses after each world . Even though the action is intense throughout , the gameplay becomes really tedious . Crash Bandicoot did nothing new for adventure games and it is n't really 3D since you 're restricted to one path . All you do is make your way through levels , dodging obstacles , avoiding enemies , and collect items and nothing more . The difficulty level is not exactly high either , and the challenge is severely lacking.Crash 's graphics are quite impressive for a PlayStation game , including well-textured environments and colorful characters . Effects like running water and mist and fog are great eye-candy . The visuals are the game 's only saving grace . Controlling the bandicoot can be a hassle since it does n't use analog . You 're forced to deal with sensitivity of the crosspad and at times will result in unwanted deaths.Aside from good graphics , you 're left with nothing but an average platformer equivalent to that of a 16-bit Sonic game in a polygonal world . While it may be 3D , Crash plays out too much like an old side-scrolling game of the past . I do n't know why would anyone want to play this game because Crash Bandicoot pales in comparison to other breakthrough adventure games at the time , like Sega 's NiGHTS and Nintendo 's Mario 64 .	-1
Augh ! I found the first few levels of Crash 1 harder than the 3rd world levels Crash 2 and 3 . It also uses a system of having to pass one level to get to the next . This becomes frustrating because I found myself having to repeat the same level over and over again because I either died or ... hell , I do n't know . I just had to repeat the level because it would n't let me continue.Also , there is no giant screen where you can save . You have to find the bonus platform , and make it all the way through the bonus part to save . Happen to fall through the cracks on the bonus ? Sorry ! You 're just going to have to hope you do n't die or else you 'll have to repeat EVERYTHING . OVER . AGAIN.A little kid is going to get frustrated and give up on this game if you get it for him . Be nice to your children . Buy them Crash 2 . Or 3 . Or games from the Spyro series , that would work too.If you really really want to play all the games in the Crash series just rent it.. even though it 's dirt cheap to buy.. ( haha ) Put the money towards something BETTER .	-1
On hog ride . People has misplaced faces and they look like they took drugs . This game sucked . : ) Sonic is better ! ! !	-1
Ok , here are the reasons this game is BAD ! .1 . The graphics are n't very good and plus most of the levels look alike.2 . It 's frustrating , and there are millions of ways to die in one level.3 . You 'll wish you never had this game.4 . Most of it does n't make any sense and it 's un-imaginative.There . Are those good enough reasons NOT to get this game ? Do n't get it .	-1
If you like orange bandicoots and video games , then get Crash Bandicoot , the stuff of dreams and legends . `` I am N.Gin you FOOL ! Face my destructive robots ! '' That is my fave quote . If you hop on the 'shrooms right before the end o ' the 2nd snow bear level and go to the central one , you shall find none other but a secret tele-port . You will go to an unknown warp room that makes no sense . Congrats .	-1
Everytimes we loaded the game it would play for maybe 5 mins and then would keep freezing and not play and my gaming system is not messed up I cant return the game I threw away the bag I wish companies would test their damn games before selling them disapointed .	-1
Overall , it 's a pretty good game . 1 star taken off because it does not feature the original soundtrack , and because of this many levels are silent or have different music . another star taken off because of load times , the graphics , lag ( come on , no amount of enemies should make a game like this lag ) , and the censoring of some levels . Also , no 2-player Co-op , only online which is stupid . If you simply MUST have it on PSX then you 'll enjoy it , if not then just buy the PC version .	-1
I bought it because it was cheaper than buying the original version which it is identical to except for item placements ...	-1
The Good : Decent story , tons of gore , great graphics and audio , new features are neatThe Bad : Abysmal combat , terrible control , extremely slow pace , laughable voice actingI tried so hard to love RE1 and look beyond its major flaws . Flaws such as the abysmal combat system . You ca n't aim at anything ! The tank controls do n't help either so you always end up dying CONSTANTLY , and with a lack of health and ammo you 'll toss your PS1/PS2/PS3/PSP out the window . The other flaw is the level design . Everything is so confusing and it 's so easy to get lost . The map does n't help one bit because all it does is highlight the hallway that you are in red and you have to decipher what doors go where.Another thing that does n't help is the game 's pace ... it 's sooooooo slow ! When you open a door or walk up stairs the animations talk forever to finish , menu are slow , text is not skippable . Another flaw is the laughable and hideous voice acting . They actors sound like they 're fresh out of remedial drama , while the live action cut scenes are just as bad . The only good part about RE is the story , enemies , and the amount of gore there is . While DC offers vibration , uncensorship , and a few game play tweaks it 's not worth it . RE4 was my first RE and going back to this is just awful . If you have n't played RE1 you 're not missing much at all .	-1
Although there are video games out there that can wow you , and then there are the duds . Not all racing games seem to be the best behind the wheel . In the case of a video game coming based from an arcade version , it really seems to be alright , but looks are always decieving . In the case of Nintendo 64 , there are very few racing games that really can make it behind the wheel . This is n't really one of them.The 1996 Crus'n U.S.A. game for Nintendo 64 , seems to be a real miss behind the real wheel . The graphics are very strong , but you are limited down to a certain number of cars to choose from , which is seven , not like the more than dozen that there are in the arcade game . Although the courses seem to be within detail , there are so many flaws , including th frame rate and the style of the game , especially within the tunnels of place like Washington D.C . Nevertheless , the game seem to be a little down and out , but at the time it came out for Nintendo 64 , it was one of only two video racing games for the Nintendo 64.It is kind of dissapointing that they could n't try to make some better video games with racing at the time , but there are so many better choices to the Nintendo 64 . If you 're really into the racing feel of the Nintendo 64 , I suggest you either get Mario Kart 64 , Rush 2 , or the sequel to Crus'n U.S.A. : Crus'n World .	-1
I think it 's too late to give a review on this game , but here goes . This is the most perverted game ever made . When you think about it , it 's pretty disgusting . `` Aim for the open spot ! `` , `` I 'll do you fast , Peppy old pal . `` , `` Fox , get this guy off me ! '' `` I 've got a present for ya ! '' EEEEEEEEEUUU ! Should kids be playing these games ? Anyway , the gameplay is fun ... for 15 minutes . Then it 's bothersome , annoying , and dull . Your team mates have the worst A.I . ever , and they do n't get power-ups . The game is horribly easy and WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY too short . Like , 30 minutes short . Also , the voice acting sucks.I hope Starfox Adventures will be good . This game should n't have started the whole Starfox thing . If so , it needed work .	-1
At first I didnt like this game , then I got into it . It 's like an electic boardgame . The one thing I hate is playing against the consol . Always play with four real people .	-1
This game is horrible . First , I bought this video & quot ; game & quot ; because I thought it was fun . Well in was n't . 1st , the graphics are poor . 2nd the computer 's difficulty level is so hard . If you play with one , two , or three people , you always lose . The computer is WAY more expirenced than a human will ever be , and it just degrades from the fun factor . So ignore the reviews that say it is so great . They are overexxagerating . My 8-year-old brother got bored with it in 3 hours .	-1
This game had the potential to be great , but the controls were very difficult to maneuver with , as your thumbs will become very sore after trying to move your character with the D-pad for however long you play the game . If you can find yourself a specialized D-Pad for fighting games , or one that can override the Dualshock analog limitations , than you just may be good to go , but you can easily take a lot of damage , and you ca n't save anywhere like you would be able to if you played any of the Doom games , or Quake . If you want something that will scare the jeepers out of you , then go ahead and play this , but if you want a comfortable game with horror elements , I think you are better off playing Doom 3 , Silent Hill , the original Quake or Resident Evil 1-3.These are my two cents .	-1
I bought this game back in December . I played it for about 2 solid hours . I come to realize that this is it . All the same levels are like this . So boring and so not like the movies , and the movement and the weapons in this game are terrible . Not to mention the animation of the Aliens , they look like they are break dancing or having an upright seizure , moving back and forth like a tiger pacing in a cage . The alien creatures are so predictable in this game , and not the least bit scary . The parasites things that crawl on the ceiling , walls , and floor is perfectly done , but I am going to have to say that even the DOOM games bring better action and better background and goals and weapon options compared to this Alien game . The PC game , ALIEN VS PREDATOR is by far way better than this , and is true to the plot and movie action.Its too bad I spend 12 dollars on this game , I am going to re-sell it right away and let some other sucker buy it .	-1
I remember playing this game back around 1996 . I was nearly 12 years old when I first played this game and I thought , at the time , this was a really cool game . I really like the Alien movies ( mainly the first and second one ) and I was fairly excited to play any game based on my favorite movie.Now , as a grown up ( or maybe still a child at heart , lol ) , I came across this game again . Remembering all my childhood experiences with this game , I was fairly excited to relive it . Right after playing it for about 5 minutes , I started laughing at myself . I honestly do n't know what I saw in this game . The game is so horribly crafted that it 's really a surprise that they released this game at all . The graphics are ok ( given the time it was released ) , and the weapons are kinda cool . However , that 's all that 's good about this game.If you are buying this game to relive some childhood memories , I recommend not buying it because you 're going to ruin some good memories . Just keep it as memories , do n't relive it because you might see it differently .	-1
This game is so stupid like one of the revier 's said all you do is find stuff and haveto find the exit door . And the last three levels are impossible to beat because they all look the same and you keep finding the same door you went through before . This game is like doom , you know the one where you just see the weapon . Dont ' get me wrong the graphics were cool but it just sucked and the only way to beat it is if you cheat .	-1
The product arrived in its original case with game booklet . The case was cracked and the CD had minor scratches on it . The gameplay controls are very confusing and difficult . It takes some getting used to . The image was very dark , not sure if it was my TV but no other games have ever had this problem . The in-game options did not have and actual brightness setting to help me with this . The sound during gameplay will randomly crackle and or stop all together . Overall i was not happy with the game itself . I had no problems with the provider or the arrival of the product .	-1
KEEP AWAY UNLESS YOU ARE A FAN OF THE ALIEN SERIES ! ! ! This game is old , and it shows . There is no Dual Shock capabilities , and pretty much everything is sprite animation except the walls and doors . It really looks like it could be a cell phone game . The story is : there is no story . You are pointlessly taken on an adventure through the areas of the first three movies in the series ( the TRILOGY at the time , obviously ) and pit against tons of enemies including human foes as well as the Alien creatures and their varients . This game is n't very creative , or well designed , but it is classic . In the end , and as a fan of the Alien series , I must say DO NOT play this game . It will only alter your perception of the series .	-1
... In more ways then one , it trys to match the style and fun of Goldeneye , but fails miserably . Considering this game was made after Goldeneye , you would think it would at least have quality graphics , but no . Gameplay and control is horrible and frustrating , where it offers only one controller set up and one camera angle where you are stuck behind the character . The missions are vrey booring too . This game is very hard even on the `` possible '' setting and has glitches where you loose the missions at the end after doing everything your supposed to.Do yourself a favor and never play this horrible game .	-1
To sum it up , Sony did n't do that great of a job trying to find a way onto the ever growing RPG scene on the Playstation . It lacks a strong story , mostly . You run around reviving Genesis Trees to remove the evil mist that has transformed kind creatures to evil little monsters . That 's right an evil mist is your enemy . I as much a believer in the etherial realm of evil as most people but come on . You do n't actually expect me to fight mist . They try to tack on a final boss but he seems oddly removed from the evil from the mist so his presence makes little sense . The battles , though the engine is innovative , are much to long . A battle can last anywhere from 3 minutes to almost an hour . The main reason that the battles are so time consuming is because of the lengthy entering of the combat combos that your character uses . The game just stops being fun when you have been in the same dungeon for two hours because you are getting into too many battles . The dialouge is also very dry and foolishly written . After meeting the character Noa I knew that I wanted her to be killed by the mist . She is maddingly annoying , and she runs around like some mental midget on steriods . The other two characters have no personalities . This makes it hard to get involved with the game . The pluses . The aformentioned battle engine innovativeness . Also when you buy a new peice of armor or a weapon you actually see it on your character in battle and they actually use it . Their are some really odd looking weapons and armor . The bad part is that gold is very difficult to come across in this game . My words to you . Do not buy , do not rent , do not do anything with this game . It should be burned and its record removed from the planet . This game does not belong with anyone Playstation collection . Unless you are really hard up for some entertainment .	-1
Avarage rpg with long and boring combact system , less than avarage story , dull characters , poor dialogue and dull graphics . Dont ' waste your money in such weak product .	-1
I did not get anything from this product personally and I have n't enjoyed this one at all .	-1
Products offered by many marketplace sellers are not original Nintendo Brand . Often they are unlicensed third party knock-off expansion packs . Ive personally had these damage a system and ruin games . Look for sellers offering the real thing by Nintendo . Ive warned you . You can save a few bucks and take your chances . Deviation from the actual product is n't even allowed on Amazon . Their very listings are a violation to begin with . Their feedback speaks for itself .	-1
I have used a lot of third party expansion packs for the Nintendo 64 and they all have been problematic causing crashes and other issues . The only one that works without a problem is the Nintendo brand Expansion Pak .	-1
I tried to like this game , I really did , but the controls are horrible and some of the worst I 've experienced when trying to shoot something . When playing I also wondered why it took developers so long to utilize the second analog stick and why it took so long for them to learn how to develop for the Playstation platform . While the story is well-done , it was hard to appreciate under the terrible gameplay . So I 'll understand if Syphon Filter fans hate me because of this review , but seriously the gameplay is terrible .	-1
This is an early military simulation type game , and pretty much obsolete , basically a mediocre pastiche of other stuff being done at the time . The graphics are supposed to be photo realistic but they are n't , the ideal in these types of games is that it should look like a helmet cam worn by a soldier in real life . Everything looks very matter of fact ... This is n't a beautiful game to behold . The psn version that I have glitches and freezes up often , I do n't know if that was a problem in the original or not but it probably was . The Gabe Logan 3D model is the worst that I 've seen in a ps1 game , he has a Sasquatch body with a Lego character face , and stands and walks like Sasha Mitchell . That has nothing to do with the limitations of the system but instead it 's a limitation of the artistic ability of the people working on the game . Controls are pretty close to as bad as it gets , very hard to steer your character , mostly worthless auto-lock targeting . There is some creativity to the level design , some okay variety , but there was better stuff being made back then . I stopped playing a level or two after the helicopter boss , because the enemies start wearing super flak jackets that take more than one clip , it turns into a head hunting game where you have to go into manual targeting mode and are left a sitting duck unable to move from the sucky controls .	-1
WAY too many positive reviews for such a crappy game . That 's what I think . Syphon Filter is atrocious . I received this game as a Christmas present ( gee , what a crappy gift ) back in the late 90 's . I thought to myself `` well , all the N64 players have Goldeneye , I can compete with them when I receive Syphon Filter for my Playstation ! '' How wrong I was.It 's not that the actual game is bad . I mean , walking around shooting people is fun , and it 's also fun to avoid being seen and make it to the end of the level without having to fire your weapon once ( and having to remain VERY quiet while doing so ) . The problem is that the difficulty is incredibly high and the storyline is about as interesting as watching the paint your baby brother smeared all over your television set dry.Without a certain special code it 's REALLY hard to get *anywhere* . The storyline is similar to one you 'd see in the TV show Jag . It 's just not interesting to me . Walking around shooting people is fun , but that 's all the game has going for it . Now imagine if that special code did n't exist where you can kill people in just one or two shots . The difficulty would be out of this world.I also hate the game for the bad memories connected to it . The Christmas I got the game , I had a few bad personal things happen . But looking back , Syphon Filter really is n't any good . It 's not surprising to me that the game is going for only a couple pennies right now used , and only a couple dollars to buy brand new . It 's not even worth THAT much !	-1
It 's a shame that the Sega Saturn did n't succeed in North America the way that it did in Japan because they received the Arcade perfect version of this game for the Saturn and to this date there still is not an Arcade perfect version of this game for any home console . You could probably find someone selling a Japanese Sega Saturn on eBay or something , but that 's a lot of trouble and who wants to buy an entire foreign system just to play just one great game ( and maybe X-Men vs. Street Fighter too ! ) ? As far as the PlayStation version goes , you are forced to select only one fighter and an assisting teammate due to the PlayStations lack of RAM and VRAM ( the Japanese Sega Saturn version requires a packed-in 4 MB RAM Cartridge which allows the game to play exactly like the Arcade version with minimal load times ) . However there is a trick if you are playing a 2 player game ! If both players select the same characters , then you are able to play the game the way it was meant to be played : 2 vs. 2 tag-team ! This game plays almost exactly like the previous years X-Men vs. Street Fighter on PlayStation with some new features and different characters . If you liked the way the PlayStation port of Marvel Super Heroes played then you will like this even better since it is more of the same with more character variety and more colorful graphics . Aside from the cutbacks in gameplay style and missing frames of animation ( another downside to the PlayStations lack of RAM ! ) , this game is enjoyable enough if you are n't obsessed with the Arcade verion too much . I would still go for the Japanese Sega Saturn version since it is Arcade perfect or wait ( and hope ) for Capcom to release a Marvel Anthology or another Capcom Arcade Classics compilation with X-Men : Children of The Atom , Marvel Super Heroes , X-Men vs. Street Fighter , this game , Marvel vs. Capcom and Marvel vs. Capcom 2 . C'mon Capcom ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
The game arrived early , which was nice . But when I played it , the thing would n't save . It played fine , but it 's hard to enjoy when you ca n't save . So I tried to remedy the situation by replacing the battery . However , it just made it worse . So I just decided to take the hit and toss the thing .	-1
i realize the vast majority of people love this game.A Link To The Past is great . I love that game , loved it when i was a kid , and love it today . And Im willing to concede that the original gameboy doesnt have the advantages of the Super Nintendo . Its understandable . However , even so , I still think the game has glaring flaws that I despise.For one , it feels ... cheap . I dont know how else to describe it , but something about this game feels unlike a genuine Zelda game . Between the plot , the fact that its so campy ( bow wow , the cheesy dialogue , the un-Zelda like setting , etc ) ... sorry but if someone told me it was a different franchise , i would believe it.Also , the item usage is just plain stupid . the fact that link has to equip his shield as an item to use it is ludicrous , especially considering there are virtually no opportunities to use the sword and shield together ; you will always be using some other item . The constantly changing items slightly bothered me in A Link To The Past , but in this game its even more annoying.The biggest problem I have with the game is this ; the overworld map . The areas are all so illogically layed out . To get to one area means going through too many others . Its not like a link to the past where everything was logically laid out ... it just somehow feels ... .too confusing . this game must have been maddening on regular gameboy.Something about this game just seems wrong . Sorry .	-1
This game is so oold you ca n't even get the graphics ! I suggets that if you did n't play this game but you all ready played ruby/sappire you will hate this game . I say wait for fire red and leaf green 2 come out it 's the same thing but the graphics are alot better .	-1
It 's a game . But the acting is no worse than the movie so I give it one extra star because you can do stuff , not just sit there and watch the lousey acting . & quot ; Qui gon , I have a bad feeling about dis & quot ; Well , it 's kinda fun , I guess . You get to whack things with yer light-saber which sounds much like the movie and the other sound effects/background ambience are excellent in my opinion . Music even better . Gameplay OK. Graphics are not the best for now but very good for 1999 . You want a good Episode I game , try Racer .	-1
Boy , this game was a real disappointment . I truly expected better for this game , since it was based on a truly cool , badass movie . The main reason why it was n't so good is because of its difficulty ... this game was incredibly difficult ! Even with the Player 's Guide it was very difficult to beat ! The last time I played it was probably 2 to 3 years ago though , and back then I was n't as skilled as I am now at video game playing ... maybe I 'll give it a second chance . Still , its chances of not being sold or something are not really good.After all the reviews that I read , I thought that when I tried my buddy 's game `` Star Wars Episode I : Jedi Power Battles '' on my step-brother 's Dreamcast that it would [ stink ] completely ... but in fact it was the exact opposite . All the reviews I read kept saying how `` Star Wars Episode I : The Phantom Menace '' was way better than '' Star Wars Episode I : Jedi Power Battles '' ... boy were those reviews experiencing strong cases of irony . `` Jedi Power Battles '' was a lot more fun than `` The Phantom Menace '' , and it was at a good level of difficulty . Too bad I did n't beat it though , my step-brother does n't have a Memory Card for his Dreamcast . If you 're a HUGE fan of `` Star Wars '' , then do n't get this game ... you 'll end up destroying the game after you see how many pointless missions you have to go through and how many impossibly difficult leaders you have to face : 1 ) Jabba the Hut 's champion fighter , 2 ) a huge and hairy beast , 3 ) a thief who stole a part from Anakin 's podracer , 4 ) a Coruscant mercenary , 5 ) and ofcourse the incredibly powerful Darth Maul . Sure , it may SOUND easy , but wait till you hear this ... you do n't always play as Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi ; in quite a few levels you are forced to play as Captain Panaka and even ... gulp ... Queen Amidala ! Really , I 'm not kidding .	-1
I was hoping this was a racing game , but it 's an adventure game , so I am not very happy with it at this time .	-1
I just have to say one thing first : There clearly are not enough buttons on the N64 controller to make a decent variety of moves . Instead , in this game , there are about nine moves , most of them useless because they do so little damage . This alone makes this game so incredibly boring after two hours that I have to wonder what the creators were thinking when they made this game . Even multiplayer mode loses its appeal pretty quickly , because of the limited amount of moves . There are also a few too many items , and it really makes it less fair that you can use a big baseball bat or a lightsaber or a beamgun to help you win . Also , considering that the gameplay was n't good enough , the fighting environment takes a new approach at trying to add lots of detail and affecting play , but most of the battle grounds are far too plain for what it is trying to attempt . But I will say that the game has incredible graphics , each character and scene developed beautifully . I also like that in practice mode , you can change the speed of the characters movement so it seems like slow motion . You can make the characters go at normal speed , or one-fourth of it , making for a great amount of Matrix-like suspense . The two challenge rounds are also a challenge , maybe too great a challenge , especially with characters like Yoshi , who do n't get a jumping boost , but an egg to throw . The bottom line is , this game is simply a rental , because that is about the amount of time it will take you to get sick of this game . If there were more buttons on the N64 controller , and the game had more play modes , this game could have been pulled off very nicely , but for now , it 's just a short rental .	-1
THE GRAPHICS ARE N'T TOO GOOD , THE CARS LOOK GREAT BUT ARE LOADED WITH MORE HANDLING PROBLEMS THAN EVER BEFORE , AND THE GAMEPLAY SUCKS . LET 'S FACE IT , THE ONCE-GREAT RIDGE RACER SERIES IS NOW DEAD . AND THIS IS THE GAME THAT HELPED SEAL ITS FATE .	-1
I do n't see all the hype in this portable gaming device . The games graphics are so terrible ( So is Game Boy Advance ) . The only good Nintendo graphics is the brand new Nintendo DS which has Nintendo 64 graphics which is n't too shabby . But I really hate the Pocket and Color because it 's a waste of money . Why would you get something in black and white with terrible graphics and then get one with only some colors ( It 's not that good ) and plus the addition of bad graphics ... now that 's what I call a bad deal .	-1
The gameboy color was good but i really like the 1989 gameboy the grey one that takes 4 batteries	-1
not get clear about that game as nothing good , not work on code i try as nothing and is that fake or not kind code for this game ? i do n't understand	-1
Honestly , there 's nothing good about this game . The graphics are NOT at all what the playstation console has the ability for . The graphics are more like Sega Genesis or Super Nintendo or even the atari rather than the Playstation . If you like games with good graphics , do not get this game.The gameplay is n't that great , also . The N64 version is much better , because the gameplay is more up to date and realistic , and plus the graphics are what the graphics SHOULD be like on the new and modern consoles.I swear , play a demo or atleast rent the game , ( I rented it and it was the worst money I ever spent ) and check out the graphics . Plus , in order to know the story of this game , you have to read the direction book . I ca n't remember it word by word , but it went something like this : `` Duke was blasted out his ship and was about to be greeted by earth , when he realizes that a swarm of aliens has crowded the city of L.A. '' Okay , so the story sounds good ... but why was n't there a sequence within the game SHOWING us the story ? And plus , all the bad guys that you shoot look like cardboard.I think that whatever company or designers created this game obviously did n't have much money at the time , so they decided to make a mediocre game . This was bad . Believe me.If you want a game with good gameplay , excellent graphics , wonderful and atmospheric feelings to it , get some game on the playstation like a final fantasy.If you want a game with awful graphics , bad gameplay , no storyline sequences , and a Sega Genesis feel , then get this game.This game is not worth any money at all .	-1
I 've been a Duke Nukem fan for a long time . I loved Time to Kill and enjoyed Land of the Babes . Total Meltdown is the most frustrating FPS I have ever played . The speed is so fast it is hard to move . Looking up and down is a chore.You use L1 and L2 to look up and down . Jumping puzzles are annoying and swimming is almost impossible . Crouching is hard and the graphics are terrible . Sound is bad as well . The only funny part about this Duke Nukem game is the rulebook ( it is funny ) . The only semi-detailed part of this game is Dukes weapons and hand animations . Even the cutscenes are bad . Please try to avoid this game and save some cash .	-1
Duke Nukem is a pretty cool series . I use to own some of the Nukem Games ... I happen to buy this game along time ago at a game store called GameMax..They had it for 4 bucks ... It was pretty sweet . The graphics were terrible but Hey it was on the Play station . The game play was kinda slow but still good . I do n't know if this is and edited copy of the game ... I can tell you is that in this version I got for PS1 you do see women take there braws off when you pay em ' cash..But they have stars ... Literaly covering there nips..And it also has a type of color ... The one that matches there bra..The games violence is over the top . But still it 's a winner ... I happen to like the N64 versio more then this even though there is n't Brief nudity like The ps1 version But in the N64 version there is more violence ... The bodies explode when you shoot them again after there dead . You ca n't do that in the PS1 version but that does n't really matter.Duke Nukem Total Meltdown is recomended for a mature audience since this game does have over the top pig exploding violence plus you go to an Adults Only Book store and there are half naked strippers with stars on them.I had fun with this game . It kinda pissed me off cause you did n't get to do all the stuff you can do in the PC version But I still liked it . Over all it 's a mediocer version.I do not recomend this version at at all ! Get the PC version ! Or the N64 ... I donno I just liked that version.It 's a great Duke Nukem Game ... Later ...	-1
Yes , people , this game sucks big time . This game came with the original Nintendo system back in late 1980s . I had a hard time trying to beat this game because the control was down right horrible . Most of the time you 'll jump off edges by accident . And who ... would pay ... to relive the nightmare of this game ? Apparent , 82 people who reviewed this game and my friend did .	-1
The quality was listed as & # 34 ; Good & # 34 ; It was on the poor side.Analog feels broken , and a feels buttons are sticky.But it did work 2/5	-1
Wow , Superman ! This game has earned the lowest review score I have ever given a game ( and I 've given some rather s***ty scores ) , and the second lowest score I have given a product I 've reviewed . I find it absolutely sickening when some of the people who reviewed this game ; like ShaqFu ( A guy who named himself after what many people would proclaim as the worst fighting game of all time and one of the worst games of all time , mind you ) , said that this game was a masterpiece and quote on quote , `` This is by far the best game on the N64 . '' WHAT ? ! You 're not serious are you ? This is definitely not the best game on the N64 , it is without a doubt the worst game to plague the N64 . That 's like the stupid people who say the that the God-awful Gamecube was way better than the PS2 and Xbox , it 's not an opinion , it 's the truth that those things suck . To show my love for the N64 , instead I will give you a list of my personal favorite N64 titles you should play instead of this:1 . Perfect Dark2 . Starfox 643 . Conker 's Bad Fur Day4 . Resident Evil 25 . Mario Kart 646 . Tony Hawk 's Pro Skater7 . Spider-Man8 . Star Wars Episode I Racer9 . Road Rash 6410.Pilotwings 6411.San Francisco Rush series12.Goldeneye 00713.Turok seriesetc. , etc. , etc.There , go play those instead . Those games are a million times better each than this game will ever be . Now let 's talk about the glorious Superman 64 in all of its greatness ! WHAT THE GAME IS : The story seems straight out of an award-winning movie . Superman 's friends have been kidnapped by Lex Luthor and thrown into a virtual metropolis . Superman must go save his friends and the world from the evil deeds of Lex . This game feels like a Pilotwings/Beat 'em up/Find the button game.GRAPHICS : The people who gave this game 5-star reviews said the graphics are amazing . Are they ? Why yes , if you think a game that looks like a PSone game made on a budget of $ 10 or it looks someone vomited Fruity Pebbles all over the TV screen , then yes it does look fantastic . Absolutely mind-blowing especially with the numerous glitches in the environments . The programming work done by Titus is stunning indeed . Superman can go through walls unexpectedly or can stuck in random places and will be unable to move for a brief period of time . Wow , Titus ! MUSIC : The musical score is truly amazing . It 's the kind of musical score that makes a person want to drown some kittens when they hear it . I want this composer 's hand then slap them across the face and tell them , `` Wow , way to suck ! `` SOUND : The sound effects seem like they were recorded in a basement . Everything is too quiet or it echoes . Another accomplished feat for the guys who made this game . Even something as simple as sound effects suck.GAMEPLAY : During my playthrough of the game this is how the missions went ; Fly through the rings ! Pick up those cars before those people get crushed ! Fly through more rings ! Pick up that police car and take it to the other side of the road ! Fly through more rings ! Beat those four thugs armed with guns ! Fly through more rings ! Use your ice breath to stop those tornadoes from sucking up those people ! Fly though more rings ! Go into a building ! Beat up robots and find a keycard ! Insert keycard then go to an elevator to another with even more robots to beat up ! Destroy those robots , open those doors , and rescue those people underground ! Go disarm bombs , and along the way beat up more robots , a tank , and a woman who has better skills than you do ! The repetition goes on and on and on . This game is very repetitive . Extremely repetitive to be exact . And very broken too . Overall , this game plays out like Pilotwings , except you break the controls , and the make the dated visuals even worse.OVERALL : If you enjoy life and do n't wish to pollute the classic N64 stay away from this horrible game . I 'm surprised Nintendo did n't do what Atari did with E.T . for the Atari 2600 . Destroy thousands of copies and bury them in New Mexico . Worst of all there 's a Nintendo Seal of Quality on the box . How did nobody stand up to say , `` This game sucks , '' that 's all it would have taken.THE GOOD : ( This category has been left blank for obvious reasons ) .THE BAD : Everything . Every single thing is bad about this game .	-1
If flying through rings with bad handling and a time limit is fun then buy this game . All you do is fly through rings and fight enemies on a time limit and with special abilites you have to find with limited amounts . It would be fun to fly around and cruise the city but with the time limit you would run out before you get anywhere . Even if this game was a buck it 's so bad it could n't even be a novelty . People who know this game might even make fun of you . Anyways I do n't think there will ever be a good superman game it 's sad .	-1
Fly threw rings and pick up cars ... this game is an insult and should be shoved up the developers anus .	-1
Bad games happen all the time , but only the worst of the worst are talked about years after their release . Superman 64 is just one of those games . Receiving no positive reception when it was released in '99 , it is a laughing joke and quite a disgrace to the Man of Steel . This looks like a job for ... a hammer to smash the cartridge with.GRAPHICS : Bad , even for its time . Blocky characters compiled with glitches in movement and glitches in general . The town is full of 'kryptonite fog ' , which is just an excuse for the lack of perception in the town . Simply inexcusable.MUSIC : The same repetitive tunes , over and over and over and over ... STORY : How long did it take for Titus to think of this epic story . Pretty much , Lex Luthor traps Superman 's friends in a virtual world , and for some reason , Superman flies through rings and saves virtual people on his way to finding them.CONTROLS : I once recall someone on Gamefaqs saying that Superman controls like a 500 pound man on drugs . That 's an understatement . Taking off and flying requires lots of work , while Superman himself steers like a drunk driver.GAMEPLAY : Before starting a stage , you have to start a series of awful missions . For some reason , Superman flies through rings , rings , and more rings , and this is quite difficult with the godawful controls . After that , Superman does odd missions such as saving people from cars , beating shadows , or stopping tornadoes with his ice breath . Note that all of this is virtual , so why is he bothering to save them ? Then after that , he flies through more rings , does a mission , more rings , and eventually the level begins . The levels themselves are terrible as well , filled with glitches and the fact that Superman is super weak . He is the Man of Steel , yet an explosion is enough to kill him . After the level is completed , the whole cycle starts all over again . As with all Titus games , to fully complete it you must play on the hardest difficulty , which is just plain stupid.BUY : No ! Stay away at all costs and do n't let it corrupt your N64 . Well , if you are interested , get it on an emulator , because even paying a dollar for this game is asking too much .	-1
This is one of the worst games of all time . I remember playing this as a kid and just kept sucking at it . When I was a kid , I did n't understand a game could be bad and simply thought I was doing something wrong and kept playing until I finally accepted this game is awful . The control in this game is really bad , especially during the ring stages . You 'll just fly all over the place . The first instinct for such terrible control is to move slowly , but you have a time limit , so you do n't have time to move slowly . When I got to a point where I could fight , it was like a maze and had no idea where to go . The ONLY reason anyone should buy this game is for game collecting only , and even then , they should save this when they are scraping the bottom of the barrel .	-1
Nintendo power voted it the worst game everGamestop and spot hate itI was unfortunate enough to stumble upon this game at my local video store . I thought `` superman , I 'll have to try that '' . I have never seen a game more deserving of the following : THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER ! IT DESERVES TO BE BURNED ! ! ! IT IS A DISGRACE TO INTELLIGENT BEINGS EVERYWHERE ! MAKIND SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF ITS POOR ABILITY TO CREATE GAMES ! IT IS UTTERLY POINTLESS ! IT MAKES SOUTH PARK LOOK LIKE SHAKESPEARE ! IT MAKES ALIEN HOMINID SEEM EASY AND SOPHISTICATED ! Somewhere far , far away , Superman weeps .	-1
I recieved this game for one of my birthday 's many years ago . At first I was excited ... but when I played it ... oh boy . The Graphics were horrible , too rough and generic . To make matters worse , they looked like cheap cartoon drawings.The missions were dull . Your first mission is to fly though magical rings . The Story is even worse , you have to save random civilians using various powers . The levels keep jumping , so your never in the same place.The multiplayer was kinda fun , but it gets dull fast . Basicly , it shifts to fps and you shoot other people for points . other than that , this is probably the worst game I have ever played . Do n't buy this game ... rent it at most..or borrow it .	-1
I could go on and on , but look , it is really very simple . It 's hard to believe Titus could have screwed up this game so badly . They should be ashamed of themselves for releasing it.So to all , always PRONTO pay attention to mister number one best sheriff student 's idiotic post ( i love you sophisticated people who drop the f bomb and think you are cool ... White Trash that sums you up : ) have a nice dayAnd do n't forget , you hafta agree with me at all times , click on the YES button under my review , obey me , everything that has to do with good things of me	-1
This game does not , in fact , star Superman . It stars his genetically engineered clone created by Lexcorp known as Stuporman . Stuporman staggers like a drunken person , relies on power-ups for super powers , pulls punches so enemies beat him , likes random time limits ( including ones that lead to an instant game over ) , can pass through solid objects like they are n't even there , and can die from things that can not hurt the real man of steel in a million years , like ordinary bullets and explosions . He was created for the sole purpose of ruining Superman 's reputation by making him look pathetic and weak . All part of Lex Luthor 's evil plan ! If you love Superman , do n't buy this game , or you 'll be buying into a lie !	-1
When I heard Nintendo was coming out with superman I got all excited , then they delayed the release date , which usually means the game is going under even more improvements . When I bought Superman I sped all the way home , turned off my phone and sat in my chair . To my suprise , this game is not worth the plastic it 's made of . I do n't even have one good thing to say about it . I was extremely disappointed . Superman used to be cool .	-1
I did n't even play this game and I do n't own an N64 , but because there are so many bad reviews I will just give this game another bad review so people wo n't buy it since it 's supposed to be the WORST GAME EVER .	-1
In `` Kill Bill : Vol . 2 '' , David Carradine described Superman as follows , `` Not a very good comic ; not particularly well-drawn . '' Well , I suppose if Caine from Kung Fu is talking about this character , then the game must be cool too , right ? It 's been almost 10 years since Titus released the most unorthodox game to ever grace our solar system . It must be good , since we 're still talking about all these years later.Seriously , there 's a lot to like about SUPERMAN 64 . You wo n't need any sort of defect warranty , because the second you flip the POWER switch , it works every time . It 's refreshing to buy an electronic device , knowing that it 's electrical circuits will never fail you.Equally cool is that Superman flies in this game ... I like it when he flies . Every time I pop in this cartridge , I 'm even more eager to watch the Christopher Reeve movies ... all 4 of them.The plot is revealed to the gamer with great restraint . You see , there are bizarre , murky images that even David Lynch or Stanley Kubrick would n't be able to visualize . For example , Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen are confined to , um ... a blurry contraption that kidnaps them ; or does it imprison them ? I personally could n't tell if it was really Jimmy and Lois , because it 's very hard for the gamer to completely understand the cutscenes . But is n't it neat to figure it out for yourself ? You see , because the graphics are so confusing and blurry , you get to keep playing again to unearth the game 's secrets . And do n't worry about completing SUPERMAN 64 in a short period of time , either . It 's a tough game , and there are few games that equal its challenge.What 's most remarkable is how the game also addresses Superman 's emotional state . I 'm sure Kal-El struggles to use his powers properly ; it 's not easy for a near-invincible alien to do the right thing 24/7 . Titus has tackled this concept very faithfully . You see , when Superman flies , he wo n't always do what the N64 Controller tells him to do . A free-spirited main character ... brilliant ! Lastly , Superman 's powers are present here . He has his eye-lasers and wind/freeze breath . That 's always neat , huh ? But what 's even more most fascinating is that The Man of Steel -- - according to this game -- - has the ability to manipulate the physical dimensions in which he exists . He sometimes will be flying casually through the sky , and then have a sudden urge to fly through the buildings of Metropolis . How cool is that ? On the other side of this spectrum , there are moments where Superman will get stuck in a wall or a drainage ditch ... ... you know , I still have n't figured out how to beat those sections of the game . I wonder , is there a higher power known only to Superman ? I ask , because Titus refuses to give us easy answers to this puzzling N64 entry . The most gifted scientists , researchers , cryptologists , artists , and gamers will not be able to solve this enigma.SUPERMAN 64 is one of the most unforgettable and original experiences in all of gaming ! *****THIS REVIEW WAS MEANT TO BE SARCASTIC AND SATIRICAL . I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU BUY THIS GAME ! *****	-1
This game was soooo bad , I took it immediately back to the game store where I got it from . I got it since I am a Superhero fan , but trust me , even if you are a diehard fan of Superman , resist the urge to purchase this game or trade for it or even accept it for free ! ! ! ! ! This is one of those noway games that should be thrown in the microwave and have the molecules in it to be melted for good.When i first turned the game on , the people in the first level looked like an oil painting . And it is nearly impossible to fly through those rings ! ! ! Miss one ring and words show up that say , '' Lex wins '' and you hear a really bad reproduction of baldy 's laugh.I put two stars for this being a fun game because it is so much fun to laugh at ! ! ! I wonder why DC let Titus make this horrific game ! ! ! ! 'sob '	-1
What what game I 'm describing . It 's old , it 's puzzling , and it 's a blockbuster game . It 's , you guessed it , Myst . And that is probably the easiest puzzle you 'll get concerning Myst , too . Since it is a popular game that was released a quite a long time ago , you 've probably heard of it by now . I 'll just say this one thing : If you 're deaf or impatient , AVOID . There is a puzzle that involves matching piano tones ... heck , even if you 're NOT deaf , it 's still quite a puzzler ! But do n't fret ... you can beat this game in FIVE MINUTES if you know how , and it can be found in the many game walk-throughs of the Internet . After all , with the difficulty of THESE puzzles , rest assured , you 'll be looking for one !	-1
I can see why this game was so hyped in 1993 . CD-ROMs were cutting edge and the `` slideshow '' graphics are fairly good and so is the sound . However , the story is n't as interesting as the ambiance would have you think and the movement is absolutely , irritatingly choppy.I do n't believe anyone has ever finished this game without some help . There is too much slow clicking around and backtracking to keep the attention of even the dullest person.I do n't like having to resort to hints in order to play a game because it 's released before the necessary technology is truely ready.REALmyst ? ... I no longer care . Riven and Myst3 ? ... even more clue-less and annoying , I 'm sure .	-1
This game continues to haunt my memories as an irritation because of it 's length and puzzles , which usually amounted to no more than treading back and forth across the island of Myst . While the environments were increadibly beautiful , they fail to make up for the miserable gameplay , which has you go to one place at least 5 times to solve five different puzzles . The story is intruiging , yet the game 's ending fails to please the player , since , you 'll discover shortly after completing it , it could be completed in a matter of minutes.A good game for 10 to 20 dollars , but you should n't spend more than that on this weekend game .	-1
Once again we have an example of an Amazon vendor claiming one thing and delivering something else.This CD-ROM did not even come in a protective plastic jacket . I suppose little Tommy 's parents would n't give him the money to purchase one so he could completely fool the Amazon Dupe customer that he paid good money for a legal copy .	-1
Others have commented on the richness of the sound score , the sumptuousness of the graphics , and the immersion the puzzles provide for you . All true . But I find people 's devotion to Riven and its predecessor a bit overblown.There are design faults here that should be pointed out . The 'slide-show ' effect when moving probably does allow sufficient computer memory for photo-realism while standing still , but it compromises the realism that the producers were otherwise attempting . Besides that , it 's simply annoying . Some have said that it adds a certain elegance to movement throughout the game , but I do n't like seeing my surroundings 'melt ' away as I move through them . Nor do I like sterile , empty environments . Oh sure , it all adds to the 'creepy ' vibe the producers were hoping for , but a universe which is largely uninhabited is mighty boring after a few hours . I wanted wayyyyy more interaction with people than I got here.I also wanted to understand why I was doing what I was doing . Oh I could solve the puzzles , given gobs of time and guesswork , but at the end I found the plot rather too spare for the amount of work invested . If I 'm going to spend weeks solving puzzles , I better understand more at the end of the story than at the beginning . I 'm not altogether sure that happens here . The universe here , for all of its graphical excellence , left me hungry for more . Clearly , this is an entertainment crafted by fine artists rather than fine writers . If you 're happy with that orientation , you 'll be overjoyed with the final product . But if , like me , you want a game to surround you with an active , vibrant plot revealed by characters of substance , Riven is n't much of an adventure .	-1
not worth 10 cents , graphics are very poor for nintendo 64 The game is very tedious finding pass cards in every level to open doors gets old very quick . The aliens also dont put up a fight just there to die . Co op would be a nice feature but it is the same maps and bots running in circles is boring . After level 2 there seams to be missing the yellow card looked every where and my friend and i could not find it . A much better version of this is availible on the ps1 . definately dont waste any money on this game , it down right sucks	-1
Oh , here they come ! Can you hear it ? The wimpy cries of the thousands and thousands of fanboys and fangirls of this failure of an RPG ! I can certainly hear them , because I 've been listening to them for the past few years . I will admit , I was excited to play this game at first , seeing as I never played it before Christmas of 2008 ... but honestly , I wish I had never played it at all . Why ? Well , stick around , sit back , shut up and read.STORY : 2/10Atrocious . Simply atrocious . You start the game as an ex-SOLDIER named Cloud ( default name , seeing as you have the option to name your main character ) , who is currently an employed gun for a resistance group called AVALANCHE . Why these groups and names have big , capital letters for seemingly no reason is beyond me , seeing as they do n't stand for anything . Along the way , you 'll meet and greet a number of people who have nothing to do with what you 'll be doing in the current area you 're in , get pissed off with the inability to comprehend even the slightest bit of dialogue spitting from the mouths of these characters , and finally come to the climax of the game , facing yet ANOTHER completely overrated villain in a battle that will last about thirty minutes ... but not because it 's hard . It 's not . I have so many problems with this game 's story ... okay , I have a lot of problems with this game PERIOD . You get a total of 9 characters in your party , and guess what ? Seven of them have absolutely NOTHING to do with the main storyline whatsoever ! The only reason they exist is for party-filling , seeing as they completely blew away any resemblance of a cast and crew of characters that actually mean something to ... well , ANYTHING . Two of them you do n't even technically have to get in your party to begin with ! You can literally beat the entire game -- all 13-17 hours of it -- with the drooling retards you pick up along the way . The game is so stale and boring in terms of taking your hand and walking you through the story , and everywhere you turn , you can see something you can bitch about for hours . Party members included.GAMEPLAY : 1/10Same thing as every other Final Fantasy game released before its time . There 's seriously nothing revolutionary about this game . It 's the same boring , lazy turn-based system you 're used to , except they actually find ways to make it even less enjoyable . The movement of the battles themselves feels and looks glitched , and every time you use an attack , skill , or spell , you 'll be sitting there waiting for them to finish with your thumb up your ass . Oh , and if you plan on summoning a powerful magic creature from the Summon materia ... well , I certainly hope you stocked up on food , drinks , and toilet paper ; you 'll be sitting there staring at the atrociously-long summon animations for the next hour and a half before you can even make your next move.PRESENTATION : 0/10What are you talking about ? This game is CLEARLY not even finished . Do you know how many glitches , bugs , and excruciating errors I found while playing this game ? Hundreds . The sickest part ? I did n't go out of my way to find them . They came to me . The character models look ridiculous , nobody has anything interesting to say no matter where you are in the game , the battles are boring and unworthy to the franchise 's name , and you 'll be lucky if you can even make it to the end without exploiting a glitch or two . Or ten . Not only that , but the game is WAY too easy . I literally played through the entire game -- story and all -- in less than 20 hours . In that time , I never once died or even lost a member of my party ( if you 're not counting Aeris , seeing as she dies in a cutscene ) . And hey , if you 're having trouble with something , just exploit one of the hundreds of glitches in this game to allow yourself the ability to walk through walls , gain infinite money and items , level your entire party up to 99 in a single fight , deal millions of damage to an enemy with a single hit , or even reset every single in-game switch so you can replay absolutely everything in the game over again with all the stats , items , and equipment you already have . But seriously , who the hell would play through THIS monstrosity anything more than once ? This unfinished , broken piece of cow dung is not worth the time.SOUNDTRACK : 0/10What soundtrack ? It 's just a bunch of clicks , screeches , and otherwise infuriating sounds . It 's not music . It 's a collaboration of anger-inducing noises that will have your TV muted in less than thirty seconds , or your money back ! GUARANTEED ! OVERALL RATING : 1/10This game is even lucky I can give it the rating I did . It 's especially lucky that Amazon.com 's ability to rate its products only comes in five stars . If it was a standard 1-10 rating , I 'd hack my computer to give it less than .5/10 , seeing as I ca n't stand this absolute travesty of a video game . It 's a downright abomination to the world , and a big slap to the face of anybody who was seriously into Final Fantasy , like myself . I 'm glad I did n't play this game until years after it came out . If I had played it back then , I probably would have been just like all of the other sniveling fanboys and girls and considered it the greatest game of all time . You ca n't rate a game based on how well it sold , and you ca n't rate a game depending on the graphics . Why ? Because both of those factors are meaningless when it comes to a true review . I strongly recommend that anybody who is interested in buying this game should steer WAY clear of it ; it is not worth even the effort to post a picture of it here on Amazon . It 's not worth a penny out of your pocket .	-1
oh hey those pixelated shemales are gon na save the world over 701251709 hours of boring gameplay ! this game super mega dumb .	-1
Are you joking . This is by far the WORST final fantasy in my opinion . Man , are you guys even trying anymore ? I looked at final fantasy x-2 and rented it and gosh , you cant even make a good game out of that.Man..bad graphics , horrible gameplay , sucky battle system , hard to understand , VERY difficult to get into it , too confusing , dumbxxx characters like cloud , hes the worst . ( except sephiroth ) , sometimes too long of cutscenes , boring cutscenes , you can barely see their eyes & amp ; mouth , etc . etc . etc . etc . times a million.I hate this game .	-1
everyone did love this game I just did n't like it I 'm not a huge turn base RPG fan if I where though this would be a fun game it was enjoyable but very long	-1
I 'd like to preface my review by saying I had heard A LOT about this game . The main character , Cloud , is pretty famous and pops up in a variety of games ( like Kingdom Hearts ) so I was really interested in trying it out . That , coupled with the high reviews on gaming sites like IGN , which quotes that FFVII is `` The RPG by which all others are to be measured , FFVII is a cinematic wonder '' had me thrilled to try this out . For some perspective , IGN quotes my favorite game of all time , Zelda Ocarina of Time , as `` IGN64 reviews the biggest game of the decade . Does Zelda 64 live up to the hype ? '' I never owned a PS until the PS2 & PS3 , so I was stoked to see this title come out on the PS network for $ 9.99.Now that you know a little bit about what I was expecting from this game , I 'll provide a little bit about my gaming style/history before I go into the game review . I 'm a huge RPG fan , and I like a variety of games in that style ( turn-based , timer , real time strategy , action ) . I 've played a few FF games ( III , X , Tactics , Tactics II ) , and I liked them all , except for X , which I found to be a little too easy , albeit very pretty . I also really enjoy the Dragon Quest games . I 've been into video games since I was 5 , and apart for a work-induced stint of abstinence in college , I still enjoy video games when time permits.As soon as I started playing this game I kept telling myself , it must get better . It 's just a slow start , surely the story picks up ? I pushed on for a few hours , going through Clouds background story and getting an idea of the main story arch before I finally gave it up as a bad job . I 'm glad I only spent $ 9.99 to try this game out , and not $ 100+.Graphics : I 'm not sure what IGN is talking about , but these graphic are terrible . Yes , I know the game is from 1997 , but Zelda OCT came out in 1998 and it 's graphics have held up to the test of time much better . Although the PS and N64 ( pre-graphics expansion ) are supposed to be comparable , a PS example of an older game with much better graphics is Chrono Cross ( 1999 PS ) . The majority of the background for FFVII is a muddy brown that looks sort of like mulch . Also , since it was being released on the PS network , Sony and Square Enix could have taken the time to revamp the graphics ( like Nintendo did for OCT on the Game Cube ) instead of releasing a game whose graphics are so bad I get a bit of a headache on the newer TVs . Maybe it would look better on an old TV ? Who knows . The cut scenes have slightly better graphics , which are almost comparable to Zelda OCT 's in game graphics.Story : I was n't really impressed by it , although it it 's an interesting concept . I 've done my best to be vague in this section so that potential buyers wo n't have the story spoiled for them.GOOD/Unique : When you boil it down , you are basically fighting as an eco-terrorist , and that 's an interesting concept.BAD : The character integration into the story is very poor . When you look at all the character 's background stories , it does n't make sense that they are all working together . If the game spent more time with them discussing WHY they have their common goal of being ECO-terrorists it would fit better . Aside from the fact that they are all eco-terrorists who live in the same beat down community , they really have nothing in common.I did not like the characters I had been introduced to , before I quite playing . Cloud is incredibly angsty and self-centered in the beginning , and I found all the social scenes centered on him to be unpleasant . His friendship with Tifa does n't make much sense to me either . Tifa is a sweet person , and portrayed as kind-hearted , yet she seems to be obsessed with Cloud who is nothing like her emotionally . Barret , um , can we say racist ? Barret , the only black person in the game , consistently beats his chest like a gorilla . Yes , let 's make the black person look and act like a gorilla.Gameplay : Mediocre.This is the most important part for some people , although I tend to find the story to be nearly as important . For me , if the story is bad , it would take phenomenal game play to keep me engaged in the game . The game play here was average , it has a pretty typical timer set-up , nothing to write home about . I 'm not sure if this game invented timer play , if so Kudos to Square Enix . The timer play did make the beginning more interesting in that you were literally thrown into the game with no instructions , so it took a little while to get a hang of the game play . Once I figured out the game play though ( ~1hr of game time , most of which is scenes ) I quickly grew tired of this game.Summary : This game has average game play , terrible story , horrific graphics even for a late 90 's game , and pretty pathetic characters . I played for 3-4 hours and then gave up on it . My free time is limited , and I do n't waste time on games that are n't fun because `` they might get better . '' Maybe FFVII really picks up in hour 4 . All I know is that I was very disappointed in the game , and I 'm quite incredulous about the higher reviews here on Amazon and on other gaming sites.UPDATE : Barrett - when Cloud is introduced to headquarters , Barrett beats on his chest like a gorilla which I found to be a poor choice for the only black character in the game to be doing . However , his overall portrayal may not be that racist , as I only played for 4 hours and many claim he is treated better in the later game.Despite the comments and emails I 've gotten about this review , I still leave it as 1-star . Without the nostalgia goggles I did n't enjoy the story , the graphics , the gameplay , or the characters .	-1
For years now , gamers have said that this is one of the greatest games ever made.I just do n't understand why they think that is.Even for it 's time , it was pretty dull and boring in my opinion.I remember dropping 50 bucks on this game when it first came out back in 1997 , and being very dissapointed with it.The main problems I have with this game are the graphics ( except the cinematics ) , the gameplay and some other elements.One of the main things that I hated about FF7 is , there is absolutley NO speech in this game at all.You have to read everything that the characters are saying.It gets very iratating VERY fast.All you do is read , read , read ... and read some more.The combat system is way beyond confusing.It 's all about they hit you , then you hit them , then they hit you with a strong attack and almost or completly kill you.The only good thing I can say about this game , is the cineamatics are beautiful.They are very nice to watch , but the characters and surrounding areas are very blocky looking ... Overall , I give FF7 a two .	-1
When I first bought my PS2 , I got FF10 , FF9 , and FF7 . That was back in 2002 . FF10 & FF9 I liked . Good stories & loveable characters . But FF7 was a drag.Then I saw all the positive reviews ( `` best game ever '' ) , so I decided to give FF7 a second playing in 2004 , to impress me . But I still did not like it . IMHO the major flaw is that FF7 has too many `` dry '' sections where you fight-fight-fight and almost nothing happens storywise ( example - climbing the 100-floor building of your enemy -or- the dumb section where you waste an hour finding a dress ) . In some sections , literally hours pass by with no story ... it feels like a step backwards to the near-nonexistent stories of the original nintendo..Also the Battle Engine - totally unbalanced . A good RPG will provide balance between physical & magical attacks , so they are near-equal . A good RPG will make each character unique with specific skills & weaknesses ( like real people-some are fighters ; others are healers ) . Not so FF7 : - it 's all magic ... physical attacks are worthless ( about 1/4 the damage ) - and the characters are completely interchangeable . You can equip Fire3 to your man & Heal3 to your girl . And then the next battle , completely flip it around , so the man is the healer & the girl is the killer . And then flip it again ! No individuality . Each character is identical . Plus *instant learning* and instant forgetting ... not realistic at all..Also , the story , while good , is poorly executed . It basically boils down to a meteor poisoning the planet 's `` health '' - very simple concept - but the writer dances around & adds un-necessary complication . He takes 2+2 = 4 and turns it into 1-5+4-6+2-1+7-2 = 4 . That 's why so many gamers go , `` Huh ? What just happened ? '' It was a good story , but a lousy script.Overall , FF7 is one of the weakest games in the FF series ( inferior to the other PS1 game-FF9 , super nintendo games FF4 , FF5 , FF6 , even inferior to FF10 .	-1
I got the PC version of this game and its A far cry from the others in the NFS series . The graphics are horrid , the cars are weird not more normal cars like the ferraris or jaguars in the other need for speeds . The cars are hard to control , its way to easy to spin out and crash . The menu controls are hard to use to , for instance most of the options dont have A pull-down menu you have to cycle through all the options . If you want great racing get Need for Speed 3 , High Stakes , or Porsche Unleashed .	-1
If you want a game that you can master in 5 mins with any character then POWER STONE IS IT . I beat the game as I got it once I discovered `` the formula '' ... I 'll list the pros and cons to give you a fair rundownPros1 ) Characters are unique and fun with personality , i.e . personal story , ending etc ( missing from PS2 ) 2 ) Backrounds are the BOSS and fully interactive3 ) The moves and effects are radical ( King Capcom shines here ) 4 ) Fast action5 ) Cool Japanese voicesCons1 ) One dimensional fighting sucks as a 3D fighting game ! ! 2 ) Weapons make no sense once you know the formula ! They just slow you down and make you a prime target for the formula ! ! OverallOverall this is a DISAPPOINTING attempt at a fighting game . The concept is good but the fighting engine is flawed . Powerstone 2 got it right and is a blast , read my review !	-1
The Resident Evil series has been on a steady decline since the first game came out in the mid-90 's . It seems that they make these games harder and harder than they should be and Code Veronica is no exception . It 's not the simplistic puzzles that make the game difficult , rather , it 's the lack of ammo and healing items that make what what should be easy battles far more difficult than they should be.Why do some zombies take more bullets than others ? Why do zombies respawn in some areas ? What 's up with all the backtracking in this game ? You 're still forced to use the stupid typewriter ribbons to SAVE ? These are some of the questions you 'll ask yourself when you play the Code Veronica . Has the series evolved ? If you get past the improved graphics , the answer is NO . The control is just as sloppy as it was in RE1 , albeit with a quick turnaround feature and a new two-handed gun mode ( you burn through bullets faster this way ) . A great deal of prior planning and trial and error is required , which may have been good back when the series was young , but it has simply gotten to be tedious today.Even the soundtrack is pretty forgettable ! The game has a rather cartoonish look to it ... could have looked more realistic but then again , the Dreamcast is n't exactly a graphics powerhouse . My suggestion ... do n't buy it . Granted , I 've owned this game for quite some time and those who are new to DC may have heard great things about CV , but trust me , this is a BORING game ! Get Shenmue instead as that game simply plays better and has a better story !	-1
If you like the original Resident Evil you will probably like this one for the most part . However , I liked the original Resident Evil , but found : Code Veronica extremely annoying.The annoying part has nothing to do with the game itself . The puzzles are a bit bothersome at times , but nothing to complain about . The graphics are n't bad and the story line works pretty well.The BIG problem I have with the game is the play control . The editorial comment says & quot ; less than perfect controls & quot ; , well that is an understatement . You have to hold down the right trigger to use your weapons , this makes firing while running and firing while retreating overly complex . Moreover , you have to go into the menu screen every time you want to pick up or use an item . There just had to be a better way.Most of the time I would say that the play control only diminishes the fun of the game , but does n't ruin it . However , in this instance it does . The control sucks the fun out of the game just as the zombies do the blood out of your neck , while you are fumbling around with the controller . The game is n't very difficult , but the play control makes the game more work then it is worth .	-1
Soul Calibur is a classic example of all icing and no cake ! The game looks great and sounds great , but its too easy . The game that is supposed to be the game for & quot ; die hard fighting fans & quot ; is basically a walk in the park . The game is a button masher ! I played the game and found that & quot ; turtling up & quot ; and waiting for the right time to attack or throw is all that it takes to succeed and it even works on the higher dificulty settings.My major gripe about the game is the dark and demonic story lines . No God fearing person should touch this & quot ; demon sword wielding & quot ; game ( I began to discover the different plots after I played it ) . I 'm not trying to sound like a fanatic but come on why all the demon intense plots in a generally evil game . What sick minds came up with this anyway ? If the game had a better plot ( one that involved some thought ) then it would be a classic , but as it stands ... no .	-1
Plodding first-person shooter with tons of fog to conceal thegraphic weaknesses . One-player missions are tedious . Only redeemingfeature is to play the two-player game with other & quot ; South Park & quot ; fans , and then only if you 've gotten the codes to unlock favorite characters.Even with friends , you 'll tire of it in a day .	-1
People , i wrote this review to warn whatever of you out there want to buy this game.This will make even the most die hard game fans throw their playstations out the window.The games has most of the characters ( whoopie ... ) which are represented with sub bar graphics and pitifull level desighn amoungst other things.the games boring.I rented it and it literally got old after 5 minutes of gameplay.If there is one redemable factor about this game its that you can laugh at how utterly stupid it is.Avoid this nerf dung at all costs .	-1
I played this on the N64 when I was a kid and it was funny and hilarious . The problem with that is ... This is n't the N64 . This Playstation version sucks ! There 's only about half the weapons and half the maps or the N64 version . This is more like a demo !	-1
I simply find the game ordinary and boring . I really love the TV-show and was very much looking forward to the game.Man I was dissapointed ! There is nothing new in the game . It is simply an ordinary shoot 'em up including the characters from South Park.Admitted : There are a few funny features in the game , the cow-shooting gun , Mr. Hanky the christmas Poo but even these things gets quite boring after a very short while.My advise is : Enjoy the TV-show and use your playstation for something else .	-1
WWF Attitude , although a good game do n't get me twisted , was not worth it on the Playstation because of the incredible loading time . ... Seriously , if you picked Owen Hart , Gangrel , Road Dogg or even Kane or the Undertaker , you had to wait atleast 2 sometimes exceeds of 3-4 minutes just to get a match started . And if you picked a hardcore or cage match , sometimes , you had to wait even longer.The trade off was truly not worth it for me because of that reason . Granted yes what you got on the Playstation version rather than the N64 version was better . PSone had more sounds , more create a wrestler options in the voice and music and some clothes . Because of PSone 's memory capability , the game could have more and that was a definite plus over the 64.I will admit that once you got the match started on the PSone version , the game itself was faster than N64 's version but still , anyone could appreciate not having to wait 5 Minutes to play a simple game . The controls can be a little challenging at first but once you get it , you 're golden and you do n't have to worry about a thing.For the game itself I will give a 4 star because it is still a fun game to play with your friends but because of the awful loading and wait time I give WWF Attitude a zero . ...	-1
THIS IS ABSOLUTLY THE WORST WWE GAME EVER CREATED . THANK GOD FOR THQ . IF THQ CAME IN ALL THE WWE GAMES WOULD HAVE SUCKED REALLY BAD . DO N'T RENT THIS GAME , DO N'T BUY THIS GAME , DO N'T EVEN ASK FOR IT . THE GAMEPLAY SUCKS , THE VOICE OVERS SUCK , CREATE A CHARACTER SUCKS . EVERYTHING FOR THIS GAME SUCKS . DO N'T BUY IT .	-1
Although I most confess that I did enjoy this game at first ( At first , meaning from beginning to end ) , I was happy with big areas to explore , and really enjoyed the Nemesis ( although it was no more different that that bald stalking guy of the inverted RE2 ) hunting you down , I most say this game is a fraud in what concerns story line structure , which on its own right , is the main mover of any story-based game.I 'm going to simulate here the general structure RE3 ( and RE2 and RE , although this is acceptable in the original game ) follows : & quot ; So , how did these creatures end up here ? let 's search the whole place while we try to get out of here . Look out ! ( Lots of guns , blood and guts follow ) Wow Jill , that was close ! Hey , he was supposed to be our friend ! He turns out to be a traitor ! Hey look , a secret lab within the main place , ( House , Police Station , City or any other place of your fancy ) let 's check it out ! Oh no , this is the truth behind the monsters ! We most stop Umbrella . Darn ! This place is about to explode , let us get out of here ! Look out , a big mean monster ! ( More guns , blood and guts follow ) Yeah ! We did it ! Our heroes escape a few seconds before the whole place blows up . Fin & quot ; Wow , we have a new Resident Evil game here ! My point here is : This game features the same story line structure of the past two games , only this time we get to play before and after RE2 . That dirty trick was Capcom 's strategy to make the game 's storyline a little bit different and engrossing.I ca n't comment on Code Veronica , for I have n't played it yet , but I think I will do so when it gets out for the PS2 , but for what I can see , the RE series is going down the drainage . I will consider Resident Evil 4 depending on many aspects . I might be playing this game ( along with RE2 ) again when I get me a PS2 , but surely , I wo n't touch it again in the near future.There is more to horror gaming than just guns , blood , guts and linear story line .	-1
Resident evil 2 , may i say , is one of the best games of all time . So was re1 , re0 , and re code veronica . But not resident evil 3 . First of all , whats with the difficulty mode ? ! ! U either put it on easy and it starts u with enough ammo to finish the rest of the game with , or u put it on hard and it makes it so u barely have enough . But the worst part is the tyrant . It chases u so u barely have a chance to explore . It literally follows u through doors and into new areas constantly ! He 's hard to kill and always comes back . Plus he can kill u in one or two hits and is fast . It takes away from the fun of the game . Forget this game and try resident evil 2 or one of the others ... .. you will thank me later .	-1
This is definetly a misleading title , it 's more like Resident Evil 2.5 . I mean looking at the improvment between RE1 and RE2 , this thing is more like a side story . In fact it should have been the third disc in RE2 , then there would be Jill , Claire , Leon . I did enjoy nemesis , he certinely scared the heck out of me every now and then , plus you have that added preasure while playing the game that hes stalking your every move . But I mean come on , the story takes place at the same place at the same time , when I firsted played the game I was like & quot ; Have n't I played this before ? & quot ; The worst thing was the lack of story , after completeing both Claire and Leon discs in RE2 , I was expecting more secrets & amp ; lies with the whole umbrella conspisy , and a rule of a trilogy is going back to the begining ( Jill ) and finding out something that was n't true in the first place , but I did n't get diddly squat . And the whole thing just got repetitive without the story to drive me to find out what happens in the end . I really wish I had a Dreamcast so I could enjoy Code Veronica , the true Resident Evil 3 .	-1
What the Resi series of games does , it does well - OTT Hollywood-style scares and genetically-mutated things that go Bump In The Night . RE 3 is no different , providing more of the same for fans who love it . It also boasts one or two gameplay improvements , but somehow ca n't quite get back to the glory days of the first 2 games in the series.The plot follows the heroine from the first game , Jill , 24 hours before and after the devastating outbreak of the T-Virus in RE 2 . A novel concept , and one which Capcom surely intended to exploit fully . The inclusion of the Nemesis character , a Frankenstein-like monster who relentlessly pursues you from start to finish , is also a nice twist , adding much-neede dtension to the game whenever he makes an appearance . The menus and controls are also tweaked , most notably the inclusion of the 'Turn ' and 'Dodge ' features , which , if learned properly , add hugely to the gameplay.Graphically RE 3 is as good as RE 2 . It 's as detailed , and lush as before . The intro is strangely disappointing , being lo-res and choppily animated - the PlayStation 1 's power is being overused . The sound is good , though , and the gameplay is the best possible version of an imperfect control system.The problems with RE 3 lie mainly in the game 's production . It 's nigh-on impossible to keep track of yourself for the first thirty minutes or so , and the map for this portion of the game is difficult to spot . The baddies are souped-up versions from the previous games and are actually too difficult to kill initially . You waste precious ammo and health packs before you realise that you can take multiple paths . Also , Nemesis , though an excellent inclusion , is again too intense for the early stages of the game , and more often than not you 'll find yourself cursing Capcom while waiting for your game to reload after he 's dispatched you . Again.As the game continues , you realise that the baddies have an unfair advantage over you , and you will end up running past the majority of them . The satisfaction of knowing a Zombie is cornered just is n't there anymore . You also miss out on some beautiful backdrops and vitally important clues becuase you 're too busy avoiding some ridiculously over-populated area.A vast , sprawling game that does yield some rewards for die-hard fans , RE 3 is not a good way to introduce yourself to the series because of its unforgiving difficulty . The storyline may also confuse newcomers . If you 're a fan who does n't mind being confused and frustrated , then check it out . If not , wait for something better , like Code : Veronica , or anything in the Silent Hill series .	-1
Back in 1996 , Capcom introduced both Japanese and Americans gamers a brand-new world of videogaming . Despite the rather awkward name of & quot ; Resident Evil & quot ; , which is just plain out laughable , the title has become a household name . This movie-like , horror series can be written down as a new genre of gaming , horror . Yeah , very few games caused gamers to devastatingly sob ( Aeries ' funeral in Final Fantasy VII ) , some games built mystery or suspense ( Gray Fox 's desperate attack and impressive dialogue in Metal Gear Solid ) , but Resident Evil led the player to leap in fright or frantically jitter . Capcom inserted blood-thirsty zombies as the adversary , and the player 's fear as the biggest opposition . In a sense , it is a movie . Useless to say , Resident Evil was among the titanic series that landed on the Sony PlayStation . The original game presented an amazing surface . However it suffered from terrible voice acting and a somewhat dull story . Capcom extremely went hard at work for their sequel . Powerful hype erupted when Resident Evil 2 was announced . Anxious gamers could n't wait to get their grubby paws on a copy . Resident Evil 2 altered the gaming industry . Other home console companies decided to cash in while the genre was sizzling hot . Konami cashed in with Silent Hill . Survival/Adventure games went mainstream . After RE2 respectfully lived , a third installment was introduced , this time hype was scarce . It came out too quickly and sources claimed the interface was going to be identical as the other two . Fearing the worst , the third installment seemed to be a horrible move for Capcom . And is . From the experience of the two Resident Evil games , the player may expect the & quot ; scare moments. & quot ; While playing on a big screen t.v. , with surround sound , the volume almost reverberating the room , and a sudden pack of grunting zombies crashing out a window , I felt no fear . Amateurs to the Resident Evil series may have a chill ride their spine , but original fans will expect each scare attempt . Though few changes have been added , RE3 fails to take a leap over the original Resident Evil 2 . In other words just imagine playing Resident Evil 2 but with more rooms and more puzzle solving . RE2 is the strongest and most remembered in the series . When catching a glimpse of RE3 , excitement was absent . RE3 seems it brought the entire series in shame . The story must take a new direction ! Like taking a role of an umbrella agent , or the T-Virus spreading somewhere else than Racoon City . Nemesis , a ferocious , mean , bazooka- equipped devil who hunts the player , proves to be a pathetic antagonist and challenge . The minigames granted after beating the game bring little life at the game 's abrupt end . The slogan , & quot ; if the Suspense does n't kill you , then something else will , & quot ; lives truly in the second game .	-1
This was one of the first games i remember playing on the Playstation . So i wanted to replay it and i was very frustrated . I never finished the game back then and it was a big pain finishing it this time around . a lot of backtracking and poor inventory setup . I still think its one of the few titles for the playstation that you should give a try . I ordered it used and it came on time and i had no problem with the CD during gameplay .	-1
I bought mine a year ago and i am very pleased with the system . It 's graphics are great and it is a lot of fun to play . But the chances are that it will now be a dying system . With Sega getting out of the hardware side means that the customer base will not grow . While more and more PSX2 get into peoples homes the same can not be said for the DC . There maybe 70+ games still coming to the DC but as time goes on that number will deacrease . A company is not going to bother with so small a market and that is what the Dc will become . Over the last few months I have seen DC games disappearing from the local stores as they decided to drop the line . The local video stores around me have dropped Dc . Tonight I found one stores entire DC gear including the systems they rented out up for sale . The DC section had been replaced with PSX2 games . Sega will also be releasing games for the PSX2 and that alone should be saying alot for what Sega has in mind . Sega has admited defeat and will leave those that supported it high and dry . The current price is very very good . But it is consol taking it 's last breaths . Was the PSX2 heaps better . I do n't think so . Not from what I saw . I enjoy my DC immensly and played it for many many hours . But it 's day is gone . The future is the PSX2 . A shame really both for Sega and for those who bought into what they thought was a excellent alternative to the big dollar console 's . Because of this I personally will not buy Sega gear in the future .	-1
Finally , Sega releases a video game system that rises above mediocrity ! Sega is famous for all kinds of failed ( and embarrassing ) video game consoles they brought to the world , but this time they actually `` kind of '' got it right with the Dreamcast.Unfortunately , Sega made a gigantic mistake that almost immediately brought down any chance of the Dreamcast becoming a success . They chose to release the Dreamcast in late 1999 . Gaming fans vividly remember what happened to the Sega Saturn just a couple years before , and people were n't going to be fooled again . This was now or never for Sega . If the Dreamcast failed , Sega would be gone from the hardware market forever.The release date for the Dreamcast was getting closer and closer . It was in September of 1999 . People were still very happy with their Playstation One because 1999 was one of Sony 's highlights for spectacular and revolutionary gaming . That was n't the only thing going on . Sony fans were also anticipating the release of the Playstation 2 , which was guaranteed to become the dominant console thanks to the relentless power and popularity the Playstation One was responsible for . It was during this time Sony was far and away the most powerful company in the video game business . Sega saw trouble ahead but continued to move forward with the expected Dreamcast release date.Nintendo was also very much alive and in the big picture with the Gamecube . Nintendo was content on making sure their fans would NOT be disappointed with the Gamecube the way they were with the N64 . Nintendo fans are loyal . *Nothing* can knock out Nintendo . Nintendo recognized their mistake with the N64 and knew they could make it right again . They knew they could give the Playstation 2 a run for its money ( and looking back , Nintendo did just that ) .And so , the release date for the Dreamcast arrived . With Nintendo and Sony on top of their game , what would happen ? What would happen to Sega ? The Dreamcast would hit the market and ... nothing . No sound . No noise . So little was said about the Dreamcast on the release date that it was like Sega had died right then and there . An eerie silence for a company that gave the world Sonic the Hedgehog.The Dreamcast failed because there were already more than enough successful gaming consoles on the market in 1999 , and people did n't want the Dreamcast to interfere with the superior , soon-to-be-released Sony and Nintendo gaming systems . Sega also failed because of their long , frustrating history of ripping people off with unsatisfactory video game systems ( such as the Sega CD and Sega Saturn ) . Sega would fool people into thinking they had something extraordinary in the works ... only to end up not supporting it . They had trouble supporting the video game consoles they created and would often leave people with failed attempts and false hopes . Sega would always fall asleep on the job . This would happen time and time again , with Sega hoping the brain-dead masses would buy their average , incomplete gaming consoles . It 's like the people who worked for Sega would always say `` let 's start something and not finish it '' .When Sega failed YET AGAIN with the Saturn , people finally could n't TAKE anymore . Anyone who was still a Sega fan by that point pretty much lost all hope . Sega was now the enemy and they had to go . A gaming console needs a giant selection of games , and unfortunately Sega only understood that ONE TIME in their lackluster history ( with the Genesis ) . Every other console they released only had a few classics to choose from among a bunch of average games.In the case of the Dreamcast , Sega tried to support it but it was too late . Sony had defeated them . Sony had defeated BOTH the Saturn and the Dreamcast with the overpowering success of the Playstation One . Hard to believe but it 's true : the Playstation One knocked out BOTH the Saturn and the Dreamcast off the market , making both of those consoles nothing more than a disappointing memory for Sega fans.In 1999 , Sega knew they would n't be able to compete with the Playstation 2 , so they finally did the right thing in early 2001 by announcing that they would never again make another video game console . Sega was DONE . They admitted defeat . That , my friends , made milions and millions of people very happy . No more junk on the market . That announcement was the best thing that could have happened , and if you happened to glance outside that day you would have noticed the sun smiling down on everyone.That meant no more arrogant Sega promotion . I used to hate the way Sega would always promote their games by putting down Nintendo and Sony . Now I can laugh at it . Sega really thought they could trick people into buying their crappy games by constantly making fun of Nintendo and Sony . Did n't work . Nintendo and Sony fans are too smart and considerate for that immature nonsense . I bet everyone responsible for the Playstation 's creation were laughing in piles of money over the `` fly , play thing , fly '' commercial that Sega created in an attempt to make Sony look second-rate . Ha ! That ugly , gray-colored box destroyed both the Saturn and the Dreamcast , and I hope Sega fans never forget it.It 's almost 2007 and people are STILL talking about the Gamecube and Playstation 2 . Why ? Because they are successful video game consoles . People will look back and REMEMBER them as successful consoles . No one remembers that the Dreamcast tried to compete with them at one point . People forgot the Dreamcast even EXISTED when the year 2002 came around . Sega 's video game consoles immediately became dated and forgettable once companies stopped making games for them . If Sega had put less energy into putting down the competition and more energy into offering their customers *complete* and enjoyable gaming consoles , maybe they 'd still be around today . As it stands , they deserved to watch Nintendo and Sony destroy them . Nintendo and Sony did n't have to stoop to dirty tactics to win over fans and the world is now a better place.With the release of Nintendo 's new revolutionary Wii system coming to America this November , along with the Playstation 3 , we do n't have to laugh at Sega 's silly attempt to compete only to end up being the laughing stock of the world . Goodbye Sega .	-1
Sega finally got it right with the Dreamcast despite the Nintendo knock off controllers . This was Sega 's last effort in the console wars but we all know how that turned out . By Sega , makes so good games on Nintendo .	-1
I bought the dreamcast with high hopes.Mostly because of Street fighter and sonic games.The only good games are Sonic Adventure 2 and Dead or Alive 2.Sega has made systems that all have failed.Like the recent Saturn.For the first couple of days its good.Cons : Very LoudNot may places to rent gamesNot many gamesNot many demo disksPros : Good GraphicsEasy ControlsEasy to hook upEasy to hall aroundOverall the dreamcast stinks.If your looking for a system with fair graphics , lots of games , good games , easy control i 'd buy the playstation .	-1
Sega does not even deserve a one star . The only good games for Sega is Sonic te Hedgehog . Sega announced the are making a deal with Nintendo to send Sonic to Nintendo . Sega has decided to give up to the competition . Finally . They will now only make games . I am happy for that . I am a Nintendo Fan . Zelda and Mario and I will be glad to see Soninc coming to Nintendo . Dreamcast starting in February will drop ... . At the end of the year goodbye Sega . Now our only compettioor is that damn Playstation and the Xbox will compete . But Nintendo Rules	-1
i thought this would be a good console , i was very very dissapointed ! it has very few good games , and the graphics arent all that i expected from it , i sold my DC and now i am waiting for the x box .	-1
Let 's sum up what is great about Dreamcast : Sensational graphics ( equal to PS2 ) , great sound , good controller design and an excellent , although not outstanding , software line up.Now , what is so bad about the Dreamcast that I would rate it so low -- -- -- Sega Corporation ! ! ! If you have n't heard the announcement yet , Sega will not longer be making the Dreamcast console . This means that the chances of many more great new titles being developed is low . I am basing this statement from my experience with the Sega Saturn . Once the Saturn production was stopped , only a handful of additional titles were released and very few stores stocked them.When I saw that Dreamcast was based on DirectX ( the same programming API as Windows for the PC ) I was very excited , because I was sure that there would be a flood of titles for the Dreamcast . There are many more titles for Dreamcast but the flood of PC cross overs never materialized and the few that did come ( Urban Chaos , Rainbow Six ) were bad.Now Sega has given up on their console and wants to make software for other companies . I believe that Sega owes it 's gamers a little more loyalty than it has shown and I hope that the gaming community reacts by not purchasing Sega software for any platform . My investment in a PS/1 was good for 5 years . My Dreamcast lasted six months . Goodbye Sega purchases forever .	-1
This controller has to be one of the worst out on the market . It has a horrible design , is made of cheap plastic , and to make matters worse , it 's also highly priced . Do n't even think about using it for games like Marvel Vs. Capcom , because even casual play will break this controller . If you 're serious about games , find an import controller made by another company . Do n't even bother with the other Dreamcast controllers out in America , they are all just as bad , if not worse .	-1
You know , sitting behind a computer screen , I 'm glad no one can see the look of disappointment that appeared on my very face the minute I began playing Tekken 3 . I am incredibly disappointed that after reading so many positive reviews claiming Tekken 3 to not only be a significant improvement over the previous two Tekken games , but also tagged `` the ultimate tournament fighter '' that the actual game would turn out to be *so* underwhelming.Tekken 3 really surprised me . But do n't take that as a compliment . I went into Tekken 3 with hardly any experience with fighting games whatsoever . I took a break for 10 years with tournament fighters after all those lousy 2D Mortal Kombat games brought me to tears . Back then I figured `` okay , either I do n't like fighting games or maybe I just do n't like the Mortal Kombat series '' . This was when Mortal Kombat 2 and 3 were popular on the Super NES and Genesis.A lot can change with a human being in 10 years . We grow older , we decide we want to learn about life and wonder where we came from , and we develop an apprecation for the things we have and the people who are in our lives . To put it simply , we 're thankful to be alive and feel good . But in some situations , things can remain EXACTLY the same . All those extreme feelings of hatred returned to me immediately after only 5 minutes with Tekken 3 . It was the exact same feeling of hopelessness I encountered with the Mortal Kombat series.I really have no idea what went wrong . No , not with the game , I mean , what went wrong with ME . Seeing as how I love watching people fight and kick butt on TV shows and movies , I figured it was only natural that the fighting style in the world of video games would appeal to me . Appeal to me a LOT . That was my assumption . But apparently it STILL has n't happened . Tekken 3 was supposed to help me wash away all the bad memories of playing old Mortal Kombat games and give me a fresh start and hopefully help me develop an appreciation for the ever-popular genre of games known as `` tournament fighters '' . Nope . It 's really disappointing to me to find out that Tekken 3 is just as bad as the rest of the fighters I 've played , and basically the same thing but with improved graphics , for that matter . All fighting games feel the same to me . It does n't even matter if they are 2D or 3D fighters.Tekken 3 , despite all the positive reviews , does NOT appeal to me whatsoever . The fighting is really clunky , and it seems each fighter delivers very basic and boring moves to each other . It 's not interesting or inspiring at ALL to me . It 's boring to watch , and even more boring to play . Why is it so much fun when they fight this way in movies but *not* interesting when it 's time to do the same thing in a video game ? I have no idea . If you want to pull off the really impressive looking moves in Tekken 3 , you have to press a bunch of buttons on the controller in a really complicated way in order to complete a move that COULD have been made *much* easier with a very simple and quick sequence of buttons . Strong emphasis on the word `` simple '' . Many moves actually require you to press the Circle button , and then jump over to the Square button . How is someone supposed to easily master this ? Going from Circle to Square is NOT easy.You see , for each of the ten characters in the game , they have major power moves that are very important to master because these are the moves that are supposed to cause the most damage to an opponent . However , many of these moves are incredibly difficult and sophisticated to pull off , and this is a *really* bad thing because the company responsible for this game apparently does n't understand the importance of making a fighting game easy to master for everyone , of all ages . That way , young and old people alike can appreciate the Tekken style.It really bothers me how ALL of the developers who release fighting games assume the player is automatically completely aware how to play the game . They assume this *every single time* they release a fighting game . Developers assume everyone who plays these kind of games will be able to understand them instantly . We 're supposed to be gifted players when it comes to understanding how to successfully pull off any number of lengthy and devestating combos to our opponents . We 're supposed to have enough time to press really awkward button combinations on the Playstation controller during a fast-paced and intense fighting match . Not just combos either- regular moves too . We 're supposed to have enough patience to continue trying the same fight over and over as we die a million times and the frustration factor increases significantly , and we realize just how IMPOSSIBLE these kind of games are.Well , I have news for every developer out there : many of us have a really difficult time with games like this . Not everyone who plays fighting games should automatically be expected to be a skilled player . Not all of us hang out at local arcades wasting tons of quarters as we try and perfect our skills . Some of us are , you know , average `` normal '' gamers who just like to have fun . The developers of tournament fighters NEVER could understand this , and years later , they still ca n't understand what it 's like to have fun . We should n't have to be a genius to play a fighting game . Not all of us can press the EXACT moves at the EXACT moment and win fights . Maybe one day a tournament fighter will be invented for a gaming console that will be specifically designed to be playable for people who struggle with them . Maybe one day ... Other things I do n't like about Tekken 3 . Despite having excellent graphics , the music is a bunch of horrible , repetitive techno sounds that hardly make me feel compelled to continue playing the game . Oh , and by the way , even though the graphics are really a notch above the rest , there 's absolutely no reason to jump with joy when looking at them . Since the fighting is just as basic and uninspiring as that of , oh I do n't know , Killer Instinct ( another terrible game ) you quickly stop caring about how the game looks . In fact , I 'd say the fighting engine is EXACTLY like that old Super Nintendo game Killer Instinct . Extremely uninteresting . When someone throws a punch , it 's so boring to watch that you just do n't care about it . That 's what Tekken 3 is all about . Having a fighting engine that 's so boring you do n't even care if you win or lose.I 'm disappointed . That 's the only thing I can say at the moment . Maybe one day an easy tournament fighter will hit the market where the main purpose of the game is to have the computer opponents move along at a reasonable pace for all the normal people out there who constantly struggle with fighting games . A game that will give people the much needed time and patience to put a move on their opponent . A game where you are n't expected to hurry up just to deliver a simple move . Somehow , despite hundreds of tournament fighters that will eventually hit stores , I doubt this will ever happen . I will never buy another tournament fighter again . Ever .	-1
If you want a basic hack and slash dungeon game , where the puzzles do n't require much thought , then this game is for you . If , however , you 're looking for a game with character development and a good story line with intricate details and subplots , then you probably wo n't enjoy this game very much . I 've played all of the Might and Magic games , except for the first two , and even the earlier M & amp ; M games were better than this.The quests and storyline are very cliche ' . Most of the skills you can train in are n't very useful . I have a fighter with 7th level repair and she still ca n't repair anything without breaking it . Trade and armsmaster are probably the most useful skills , as well as learning , which helps you level faster . One plus is that when you level , you can up your stats even if you ca n't afford to train.A huge improvement would be if we could edit our own levels and quests , but the game does n't even include that.The 3D-graphics are n't too bad , once you get over the hilarious way the characters look ( imagine a Barbie or Ken doll crossed with Japanese animation , and you 'll get the idea . ) Another plus is the hack and slash portions of the game are addictive . If only the plot was better .	-1
I 've played a lot of games in the past few years , and Dark Stone has to be one of the most boring games in the world . When it was new it did have it 's halfway decent ( although a little too cartoonish ) graphics . But now that the game is a few years old , it can not even claim that.A bad attempt at a slightly more complicated Diablo , this game just does n't cut it .	-1
I do n't mind if the graphics are n't completely state of the art , but this was ridiculous . Not only were the graphics terrible , but the rendering engine they used was pathetically slow and the effects were horrible . I ran this game on a P3-733Mhz with a DDR GeFORCE256 video card and could not enjoy the game at any decent resolution because of the huge frame hits you would receive depending upon where in the track you were . Terrible . Even at high resolutions the cars and tracks looked pixellated and cartoonish . I-76 , which is many years older than this game has graphics which kill NS4 . I am unbelievably dissapointed .	-1
To be quite honest , I found this to be the most tedious role-playing game I 've ever played . The narrative sequences are ridiculously long , the graphics are mediocre , and the mechanics of controlling other characters in combat is poorly designed . I read a lot of good reviews of this game before I bought it , and I was terribly disappointed .	-1
I really love platform games . I guess it is because I love to explore and make my way through those cool-looking worlds . And I have to tell you , Sonic Adventure 's worlds look great . This was the very first 128 bit game I had played and boy , was I excited . The game really disappointed and annoyed me however.After playing through the game a bit , you will start to realize that after the fun action stages , you will begin a squence of boring and annoying cut-scenes ( that you ca n't skip ) that will drive you mad . Most of them involve sonic and Robotnik threatening each other , or just characters talking . Also , the characters will pause between almost every sentence . It takes forever for them to finish what they are saying , and you wo n't really care most of the time . Boring . If you make it through the cut-scenes , then you wander through the adventure stages , looking for the next action stage . Mainly by going to a red hint sphere that will say something like & quot ; Have you searched the entire adventure stage yet ? & quot ; When you find another action stage , things will get a bit better , but only for a while . Some of the cool things you can do are snowboard , speed through a futuristic highway . Cool . But , then it is back to boredom and the annoying voices ( especially tails . ) If you are a real platfor fan , skip this one and get Rayman 2 . It may not be super-fast , but it sure is n't boring . And it has better worlds and graphics .	-1
Sonic Adventure is a game that tries to do way too much . There are six characters and only one ( sonic ) is decent . Most of the game is boring and the rest is usually to broken to be any fun.The Sonic level 's , which should have been the entire game , are plagued with a broken camera ( it was on crack , sometimes it would focus inside a wall ) and bugs . The boss battles are way to easy , and when you started to pick up speed I felt like the game was playing itself ( I tried to fail on the whale level and it was impossible ) . Plus the sonic story is super short . I did n't really like the other game stories.In the Tails levels you just replay the same levels as sonic but you can fly . The camera and bugs are even worse here.The E-102 Gamma levels are a super generic shoot-em up game.In Knuckles level 's you search for gems in a map and is very tiresome.In Amy 's level you pretty much just walk around and hit enemies with a hammer , it gets old very fast.I save the worst for last Big the cat . His levels are just a fishing mini-game . There 's nothing special at all , just a boring fishing game , way to go sonic team.Most of Sonic adventure you play boring sub characters , and when you do get to play as sonic , it 's too short and plagued with too bug to be any fun . This is by far the most overpraised Dreamcast game out there .	-1
With all the great reviews , I thought I would give it a try . Yeah , it 's dated , but I expected that . Some dated games are fun ... I just did n't think this was one of them . I played it for about 5 hours on `` normal '' , which was enough time to learn the controls and understand the game play . The map is difficult to read/understand . The psychic abilities are okay , but switching to them takes a little time ... enough time for the zombies or monkeys to kill you . I found the interface a bit clunky . I just could n't get excited about this game or the story/narration . I thought it was tedious , not fun.I was able to get this working on Windows XP Home SP3 , but it took a little effort.If you need help , go to youtube and search for this video : hHg1cXfTUBcHe does a good job of explaining how to do it.Here it is in a nutshell : install the gamefind , download , and install SystemShock2_patch.exein the installation folder , rename sshock2.exe to sshock2.oldfind and download SystemShock2_xp_2000_fix.zipcopy the exe from the above zip file to the installation folderin the installation folderopen shock.cfg with notepadat the end of that file , on a separate line , add this : safe_texture_managersave and exit the fileWindows XP boot.ini changes ( BE CAREFUL ! ) go to control panel , system , advanced , startup and recovery , settingsclick editadd the following line under the [ operating system ] section : multi ( 0 ) disk ( 0 ) rdisk ( 0 ) partition ( 1 ) \WINDOWS= '' Microsoft Windows XP - System Shock 2 Game '' /noexecute=optin /fastdetect /numproc=1save the boot.ini filerebootwhen prompted , select the `` Microsoft Windows XP - System Shock 2 Game '' optionWindows boots like usualplay the gameAfter you play the game through to its ending , be sure to remove the `` numproc=1 '' line that you added to boot.ini.Visit my Amazon Collections to see my 4-star and 5-star PC games : http : //www.amazon.com/gp/customers/A12LH2100CKQO/collections	-1
I 've always been a Thief fan , especially Thief 1 . I 'd read about this game over the years , but never played it because I was busy playing other games . This game was developed by the same folks who made Thief , so I figured it had to be great.I rate it with one star because I can not install it on an SD card and play it on my netbook which lacks a CD drive . Even after doing a full install , the game refuses to start without a disk in the non-existant drive . This is inexcusable because I *paid* for this game , while those who obtain it through other means are able to do the above.Once again , I ( the honest customer ) get shafted . I regret buying this game and I will never ever touch another EA-published product again . Thanks guys ! To all the gamers , ask yourself this question : How will you play all of these games that require a CD in the drive to run when modern computers eventually stop using optical media ? Oh , but I forgot , nobody is supposed to be playing games from a decade ago . We 're all supposed to get the shiny title of the month !	-1
Silent Hill in space and just about as annoying . I understand the tension that the developers were trying to create and they succeed but this is ridiculous . Constantly low on ammo with weapons so defective the manufacturers would be promptly put out of business all the while being attacked by hordes of wrench wielding , regenerating zombies . You aint got ta chance and thank heavens for cheats or I would n't be bothered . If you could get it for under 10 bucks go for it and kill some time . But I sure would n't spend the money that is being demanded on Amazon .	-1
This game was bought and rather farfetched . I hoped it would work and It does n't play story mode at all . So I 'm stuck in training mode and can only play the first training session . A shame .	-1
Do n't pay a penny for this , folks . Move on to an EA game . There is very little in the way of actual physics calculations between players in this game , every interaction is merely a scripted animation . RBs are stopped in full stride by shoestring tackles . WRs run their routes at half speed while the DBs shadow them *IN FRONT* of their routes . Offensive line programming is horrible . Guards and tackles blow assignments on EVERY play , doubling up on a DT and allowing LBs to come free and tackle the RB at the handoff . There is no player momentum , a flaw I 've noticed in a number of Sega Sports games , meaning any player can stop in mid-stride and immediately run full stride in the opposite direction . Sit back and watch the computer play : 3and out , 3 and out , 3 and out ... This was an incomplete game that should not have been released . So what if it looks pretty ? It plays like crap .	-1
I was very disappointed in this PC game . It was boring . Everything about the game was chance . You have little control over what happens . Game time is short and it is very likely you did not win anyway . It was a waste of my time . If you really think you need this game - buy it used or at least a new one cheap .	-1
Costing as much as fifty dollars new at the time , I nevertheless was suckered into buying two of these back in 1999 or so when I played my N64 a lot.The thing is insanely sensitive and easy to break . The first stupid thing it does is in its use , you put the Gameshark into the slot , then stick the game up on top of it . As with many cartridge game systems , it seems you need to wiggle it about , and position it just right just for it to work . I remember spending several minutes during the last leg of my first Gameshark 's life trying to adjust the game on top to be slightly lop-sided , because it simply would not work if I just pushed the cartridge down all the way , like it 's supposed to.Of all the functions it has , half of them do n't even work . The function of basically making up new cheat codes based on gameplay regularly froze up games , and at worst , caused catastrophic damage to the Gameshark . I remember one instance I tried to create a new cheat code , and ended up filling up my entire Gameshark 's memory with useless information . Almost none of the pre-set games and codes worked , names were screwed up with random characters and letters , and largely I had to just guess which code would do what for which game.The fifteen minute instructional VHS that came with the Gameshark was a hilarious joke -- -both VHS 's had the little plastic tab on the bottom STILL INTACT ! If you still remember how VHS 's work , this means ANYONE CAN RECORD OVER THE VHS IF THE PLASTIC TAB IS STILL INTACT ! I could literally have recorded gay porn over the VHS , packaged it with the Gameshark , sent it back for a refund , and they likely would have sent the VHS in a new package to be sold to someone else ! Whatever benefits the Gameshark gives are simply not worth it in the long run . It does n't ruin your game permanently , but it ruins itself just fine . There was never any justified reason for the way my two Gamesharks just simply broke down and stopped working .	-1
A fun shoot 'm up , no less , and regrettably , no more . Fans of the board game , the series , or even the role- playing game will be in for a bit of a dissapointment . The game has few options besides & quot ; click and shoot & quot ; . Still , I spent a fun few hrs playing it ( and a lotta dlrs buying it ) .I hope we 'll get a better , more extensive version soon .	-1
This controller is an okay replacement for the original SNES controllers , but not as good . The reason why this controller is not as good as the original SNES controllers is because the buttons are not as sensitive to button presses unlike the original which have very sensitive buttons ; the buttons after using them for several months or a little bit more start to sink down more inside the controller because the springs are not as strong as the ones in the original controllers are . In addition , they are made cheaper than the original controllers and are not as durable , so they will not last as long . My recommendation is to not buy these controllers and get refurbished original Super Nintendo controllers on ( ... ) or the exact replica version because they use the same exact materials to make those controllers as Nintendo does for their controllers . The only difference is the exact replica 's do not have the Nintendo logo on it . I got two refurbished original Super Nintendo controllers from that website and they work excellently and they will last for many years . And another thing about the New Port controllers , the first time you use them , the D-Pad buttons are rather stiff and eventually lossen up after using them for a while and become easier to use . A last warning about the controller , the down function on the D-Pad does not work very good , unlike on the original Super Nintendo cotrollers , the down function on the D-Pad works excellently .	-1
I know what you 're thinking ... I need another controller . The generic ca n't be that bad , I might not like it , but I 'll be able to play.No , you will not . You wll hate every minute of this.As others have said , the buttons are actually ok , but the d-pad will drive you insane . Rage quit-inducing . Do n't bother , go out to your local retro store and pick up an actual , old SNES controller . The price will be well worth it . I 've pretty much thrown this in the garbage , but I ca n't seem to bring myself to it for some reason , but it deserves it .	-1
With a form-factor nearly identical to the original PlayStation controllers ( but minus the analog sticks of the & quot ; Dual Shock & quot ; controller ) , this controller 's obvious benefit is to owners of & quot ; Connectix Virtual Game Station & quot ; , the PlayStaiton-on-Macintosh emulator . It 's also handy for arcade-y titles and MacMAME , the emulator of classic arcade video games.The one place Gravis makes a change is very much for the worse -- the four separate directional buttons are replaced by a single pivoting directional-pad . As too often happens with designs like this , the D-pad pushes two switches at once , and ALWAYS comes through as a diagonal ( eg , right + up , when you thought you were just pushing right ) . The frequent inability to enter a true right , left , up , or down is annoying in some games , particularly in navigating the menus of an RPG , and deadly in others ( PSX & quot ; Asteroids & quot ; is unplayable when rotating your ship sometimes inadvertantly puts you into hyperspace , since that 's what & quot ; up & quot ; does ) .Also of note is the fact that this controller works only with games written to use Apple 's & quot ; InputSprockets & quot ; . That 's true of most late 90 's / early 2000 's games , but not of some earlier titles ( & quot ; Descent & quot ; , which used to be bundled with Mac Performas , comes to mind ) , and it 's not clear if Sprockets will be supported in the upcoming Mac OS X.That said , driver installation is easy and has been hassle-free on my two iMacs and my iBook . USB plug-and-play almost always works without a snap , though I 've found it 's better to plug it in once the Finder is up instead of during the boot cycle.If you play lots of Mac games ( and by the way ... HOW ? ! ) , this is better than relying on mouse/keyboard alone , but the D-pad problems are a major aggrivation .	-1
This will get the job done on most games , however if you want to play games like Street Fighter or any other game that requires directional based special moves , you can forget it.Software on the site allows you to program special move buttons.The buttons are terrible . They 'mush ' down . They are not springy as they should be .	-1
On the face of things , & quot ; X-Wing Alliance & quot ; has the makings of an extraordinary entry into the Star Wars franchise . The characters are engaging , with enough backstory given in the accompanying written material to start a small movie . Conveniently , there *is* actually a small movie which opens the game off with a real narrative bang . It makes one wish that Lucas himself had taken a page from the game producers when he was making _The Phantom Menace_.Unfortunately , after this high point , the game soon degenerates into endless missions which advance the plot -- painfully slowly . Oh , there are cool points along the way . The cut scenes are interesting , and the sound environment throughout the missions is superb . But the in-play graphics engine is fairly ordinary by LucasArts ' own standards . The missions themselves are endless variations on the same themes . And the game 's conclusion is less than satisfactory.But there 's another side to the game -- multiplayer action -- and for this the game deserves some praise . As a vehicle for capturing the gaming possibilities of the Net , & quot ; X-wing & quot ; is worth the purchase price . There 's a large , loyal player base for the whole & quot ; X-wing & quot ; series , so you 'll never be alone on the Net.Still , there are better options to get what you want out of a Star Wars game . & quot ; Rogue Squadron & quot ; is an infinitely better single-player space game . And the upcoming & quot ; Force Commander & quot ; promises to be something of a new standard in multiplayer action . By comparison , & quot ; X-wing Alliance & quot ; merely feels like a solid update to an aging series .	-1
This is a very dissapointing system . Slow loading , Bad graphics , and terrible games . But it has a good controller .	-1
As usual Interact accessories dissapoint . This Tremor Pak jumps too hard for what is taking place on screen and absolutely sucks . The slightest action on screen and it wants to jump out of you hand ... .not good at all . Instead of adding realism to a game it proves to ba an annoyance ! AVOID AT ALL COST . Get the official Sega Jump pak instead	-1
This thing does nothing but shake the heck out of your arms when you play . It is at times comical . It makes your controller rattle , you hear shaking noises , and feel like you are having some sort of seizure.This tremor pack thing will die off in my opinion . It will go the way of Robbie the Robot for the NES . Remember him ? Neither does anybody else ... It is an interesting idea , but it does n't really enhance the games . Just because the controller shakes in your hands does n't mean you feel like part of the game . In fact , with all the shaking , it might even disrupt your game play . You are much better off getting a visual VMU to put in the front slot , at least that enhances your gaming experience . I have this tremor pack and after playing with it for a few hours I took it out and have n't used it since . Do n't waste your money on it . That is the best advice I can give .	-1
Sure it was fun for the first hour then it died . I could never get the kids to stop vandalism . Riding the rollercoasters were n't fun at all . You want a theme park game get Rollercoaster tycoon . Rollercoaster tycoon not Rollercoaster tycoon 2 , but I wo n't get into that . Where can I get a refund ... . ?	-1
I LOVED Theme Park and Theme Hospital , RCT is the best Sim game around so I had high hopes that Theme Park World ( as its called in the UK ) would go one step further.Basically this is a kiddies game . Its NOTHING like Theme Park and your very limited to what you can do . There are fun rides and the best part is walking round the park and going on your rides but you dont have the same amount of control as in RCT.Its nice to look at ( although I did n't like the 3D style ) and you need a good spec machine otherwise expect jerkovision ( or if you build too many rides ) . Theres only 4 parks/scenarios ! unlike RCT where there are loads plus an add on pack ) . My nephew liked taking pictures of the park and emailing them but it has taken a whole new view point into Sim games . This is n't a true Sim game - I think we need a bit of going back to basics here and seeing what makes a Sim game . Just look at Theme Hospital and RCT . It also loses marks for having the only online help assistant who is more annoying then the MS-Office Paperclip one ! ( Luckily you can turn him off ! ) I stopped playing it after a week . So will true Sim Fans . Bring on another RCT add on pack !	-1
Sim ThemePark was not what I saw coming . Right when I got it , I popped it into the CD-Rom on the computer . I was so excited ! But then , the downside comes along . The installation takes forever . I had to try again to make it work . Then , it takes forever just to get into the game . And when I finally got into the game , the colors were all screwed up . Okay , so I messed with some hardware on the computer , but even after my mom fixed it , they still would n't work right ! ! And whenever I go into the game , it gets stuck right after I click & quot ; quit & quot ; . So I have to restart the computer completely . Since the day I first got this , this game has not seen the CD-Rom . At all . I am looking into Roller Coaster Tycoon , and am hoping that it will work much better than this . Thank you for reading my review !	-1
I thought this game looked like it would be great -- but it turned out that it was boring , irritating , not to mention that it has bugs- my computer is almost brand new , and this game would crash every five minutes . A few months later I bought Roller Coaster Tycoon , and I became addicted to it- I LOVE it ! If you are interested in this game , I recommend that you buy Rollercoaster Tycoon instead , it 's a lot more fun , and it does n't have bugs- do n't waste your money on Sim ThemePark !	-1
This is the Worst Game i ever bought the first time i bought it there was a problem with it and then the 2nd time its was still broken and had a problem with it do n't waste ur money on it its so not worth it i still have the game but i 've never been able to use it since its so messed up	-1
I guess you could say that this game was pretty much a dissappointment . I probably would have liked it more if I had n't already bought Rollercoaster Tycoon ( even though I 'm not really a fan of that game , it 's a LOT better than Sim Theme Park ) . I felt ripped off when I found out that there were only four theme parks to choose from , which made this a very short lasting game . Another major problem is - you can even build your own rides ! Talk about cheap.Overall I give Sim Theme Park 2 stars , I gave the extra star because I probably would have liked it more if I got it before I got Rollercoaster Tycoon . Actually , this game is pretty good for all ages , it 's just leaning a little more towards the younger kids , about I guess 6-12 . If you want a game for older gamers , try Rollercoaster Tycoon . ( I suggest that you just ditch the thought of buying a game about building amusement parks and get a game like The Sims or somehting ) .	-1
Well there 's a lot of ways this game could have been fun , IF only they had tried to put more into it , ok it says on the front box that you can chose from 4 different types of parks , In reality all the parks are the same , just different animation , they all have a feris wheel , flying bird thing , ect ... The little talking advisor cannonball in the corner is insanely inoying , and yet they make it so that you HAVE to have him to play the game , other wise you 'll not be able to get to problems in time . I mean are programers IDIOTS ? Do they think that a little cannonball making bad jokes and talking in the most annoying voice you have ever heard is what we really want to have as an advisor ? And why do they animate the kids and everything in the cut sceens so unrealistic and stupid looking ? In almost every game programers feel that they need to make humans look as stupid as possible , why ? Its not funny , it demotes the animators intelegence . Anyways the only thing thats really good about it is that you can ride your own roller coasters , and you can turn the little cannonball guy off ! Although it will be harder to manage without him .	-1
first in the series by blizzard . not something I would play nowadays but this was a very interesting rpg back in the day when I had been a gamer .	-1
Hope you like backtracking cause you 'll be doing that allot in this one . I bought this game at a yard sale for a buck $ and I still think I got ripped off . This game has no strategy , none . The controls suck , whatever happened to up , down , left , right ? Guess the developers at Blizard entertainment thought that is just way to convenient . I have no clue on how this game got so many good reviews over the years . This game is for anyone under the age of 14 to like it . You ca n't just fight a boss head on , ( like they do in games that were actually worth playing ) , no you have to run behind a door or somethin ' and cast a spell until he 's dead . ... Yeah , I know , as if a boss does n't know on how to open a freakin ' door . Another thing that got me was when your backtracking outside some kid just outside of this underground church that goes ten stories down . The kid has some info on a place or a location or somethin ' , he charges outrageous prices , like if you want a sword or somethin ' , it 's $ 4689 . WTF ! Ya know a nickle use to go a long way in the 1920 's , this is like 1400 's , Whats he fixin ' to buy , a castle ? I do n't what my dollar back , I want the 8 hours I wasted my life on playing it . So do n't buy this game , no matter how little of a price they want it .	-1
I REALLY DID NOT LIKE THIS GAME AT ALL ! IT WAS WAY TOO FANTASY-BASED ! DO NOT GET THIS GAME IF YOU LIKE GAMES THAT ARE EVEN SLIGHTLY REALISTIC !	-1
In the exact sense of the word , the game cheated me . The suspense built up by the time you finish the third level culminates in one of the most shocking and innovative pieces of plot I have seen to date . What 's the problem ? The remainder of the plot is a piteous attempt to bring the innovation and tie it onto the & quot ; and all was well & quot ; ending.The graphics are amazing , although there is way too much green , and you spent less time in original-looking levels than in the & quot ; normal & quot ; ones . Nevertheless , from the beginning , they look quite surreal and amazingly life-like . More than that - they are aesthetic . The main character is pretty much non-existent , snce he has no lines , and his only role in the game is to capture monsters . The battle engine offers far too few choices , since upgrading your character 's equipment is nonsense ( he rarely enters actual combat ) , and you ca n't equip your monsters . Therefore , the game 's central and only concept is to go through level after level , capturing and merging monsters . There 's nothing more to the game . Oh , yes , there are several original parts ( you earn money by selling the captured monsters ) , but they are too few .	-1
Starcraft is one of the most annoying games ive ever played . Sure , terran marines give u a little laugh now and then but the controls are frustrating . You have to right click ( why not the usual left-click ? ) to select units and you cant deselect them . Building times are extremely long- and so are the units . Gameplay on my PC is overall boring and slow ( on a Pentium II 400 , voodoo3 , 96mb RAM ) . I have only got up to the third terran mission then finally gave up . And whats up by only controlling 12 units at a time ? The Command Conquer series lets you control all units you have on screen.Starcraft 's ingame graphics are n't that good , FMV qualty is terrible and Battle.net gives you a pain in the a** because of its slow server and few options . Westwood online gives the player more options and is also faster . All in all , i say the command and conquer series is better - go play tiberian sun or red alert or any other C & amp ; C game - SC isnt worth your time or money .	-1
{ YAWN } Very boring disapointing game . Terrible gameplay , graphics , bla bla bla . The cinematics run at an extremely slow frame rate . At least the music is kinda good . I do n't recommend this for any god damn gamer . = [ ...	-1
I recieved this older game quickly . But I was still playing the new Tomb Raider on PS3 and did not install it on y PC for a couple of weeks . I could not get this agme to work properly on my new computer . It loaded fine and background music worked but the graphics were .. hmm .. stone age looking . No matter how I tried to reconfigure my graphic card it would not adjust to be playable graphics . I deleted it from my computer . I gave it to my son to try and load on his slightly older system , but he has n't tried to play yet because he is playing his new games . I will update and post what he says about his experience with it .	-1
The game will not load on my Mac . The box says its supposed to . This was a very big disappointment . I was trying to get out of the shooter games .	-1
Hey , maybe I 'm doing something wrong but , I have n't been able to get this game to do much of anything ... the graphics are poor for this day and age and the controls were even worse ... I did n't play very long though , so it 's not fair to say it truly [ stinks ] ... Maybe I 'll try it again and see if I missed something ...	-1
Even when this game first came out , it was fairly mediocre . Let 's move on , shall we ? There are many , many games that topple Half Life and Counter Strike released since 1998.Contrary to what the Amazon editorial had to say about this game , Half Life is not the bloodiest ( Soldier of Fortune ) , is not the smartest ( No One Lives Forever ) , and is not the scariest ( System Shock 2 or Clive Barker 's Undying ) .Half Life is a hypefest .	-1
I loved the first two Gabriel Knight games ( `` Sins of the Father '' and `` The Beast Within '' ) . They were creepy , well-researched , and had great atmosphere.Well , `` Blood of the Sacred , Blood of the Damned '' had great potential -- Rennes-le-Chateau and vampires ! Neat ! But poor gameplay really squandered that potential.To give you an example of what I mean , one of the puzzles involves getting a vehicle so Gabriel can get from one place to another . A perfectly good motor scooter ( I think ; it 's been a while ) is available . But noooooo ... Gabriel refuses to ride something so wussy . He has to have a big motorcycle . So that 's the puzzle -- getting the selfish jerk a motorcycle to ride.Let me get this straight . He 's a detective trying to solve a case , but he 's going to waste time finding a cooler ride ? That was the point where I threw the game out the window , so I ca n't comment on how it ends , unfortunately . The voice acting was pretty lame ; I do n't know who told Tim Curry he could do a New Orleans accent , but he can't.Now that [ the price has dropped ] , it 's worth trying if you 're really into Gabriel Knight . Otherwise , there are much better adventure games out there that are also dirt cheap . Try one of them .	-1
On paper Hellfire seems like a great idea . Take a really good game , add a couple additional levels , quests , items and monsters , put in a couple of new classes , and bam : instant winner.Sadly that does n't pan out in practice . Part of it is that the Hellfire design feels largely uninspired and lacks the cohesiveness , balance and ingenuity that went into original Diablo . In fact there are only two really good features in Hellfire . The first is the `` Jog '' toggle that allows your character to run in Tristram . Too bad it does n't function in the dungeons . The second is the `` Search '' spell that helps you locate items on the ground . Unfortunately it 's a spell , so you have to spend mana on it . Blizzard rolled up both these features in Diablo II in much improved form . As it stands they end up not benefiting Diablo very much.The rest of the additions are just mediocre or worse . The new character class is fun , but kinda unbalanced , and does n't really add a lot of depth . Lots of stuff feels tacked on and has an inconsistent art style that does n't match Diablo 's polish . There are n't really a lot of new quests . One ( of the two ) new area is downright annoying . Some of the best features can only be enabled by editing a special file outside the game.The worst part of Hellfire is that playing it means making a tradeoff . It is not a seamless expansion to Diablo - it 's almost like a separate game . Your Diablo characters are n't portable between Hellfire and the original game , so you have to roll new ones . And while Diablo went on to gain five more patches after Hellfire 's release - Sierra only patched their game once ... so Hellfire players have to contend with bugs long-fixed in Diablo . In addition to those bugs , Hellfire brings a set of its own , which never got resolved . Hellfire players ca n't ( without hacking the game ) play multiplayer . This expansion is not playable on Battle.net . The music in new areas is lacking , and because it is n't read from the CD , the game glitches whenever an item is picked up . The drop system is bugged out the wazoo , to where finding some of the new unique items is actually impossible.I would really recommend this one only to die-hard Diablo fans . Those without it are not missing out on anything . Sierra tried to pull it off but they just could n't match that Blizzard standard set by the original game , and the new features are n't worth fighting the bugs and irritants brought on by this expansion .	-1
The expansion was outsourced to Sierra Online and the quality from Diablo I was not maintained.The expansion does not really add anything : monsters seem out of touch , music , ending are nothing compared to the original . Skip this and go straight from Diablo to Diablo II which is another pure marvel .	-1
This is a joke of a game . Let 's see , a campaign can be finished in an hour . The AI makes you conclude that enemy fighter pilots have a deep vindictive nature ( is mine the only plane in the sky ? ) . All in all , this game is like a new level of computer chess -- boring as hell , and yet somehow intelligently scripted [ SCRIPTED ] !	-1
If a game does n't hook me within the first half-hour then I 'm just not going to see it through to the end . Homeworld just seemed like Age of Empires : In Space to me and the slow , confusing gameplay really got on my nerves . I know that this game has an Army of fans who will denounce my comments , but I simply could not get into it.Usually , I like space games and I was hoping that this would have a Star Trek-ish feel to it . I also quite the Wing Commander games and since it only cost me 99p then I thought I might as well give it a go . Call me shallow , but it did n't give me instant satisfaction and uninstalled it after only 45 minutes .	-1
Well , I must say that I was really disappointed by this game ! I got my hands on it as soon as it became avayable . Having played for interminable hours with the original Civilization game I had great expectations from this title . In the end it really turned out to be one of the worst sequels ever ! The MAYOR SHORTFALLS ARE : 1- Game speed . By the time you reach the space age you will not have been able to explore much of the world , and will not have been able to build an army from a particular historical age . Since the speed is so fast , by the time you have an army of , let 's say musketeers , you have already discovered planes and the nuclear bomb . THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING ! 2- Units : Fewer than its predecessors and less realistic . 3- The space age : It is only confusing and does n't really help to make the game interesting . 4- Unconventional units : You have now lawyers and eco-warriors that work something like the spies in the original game . In the end they end up beying only annoying and totally confusing ! It would have been better to add a more sound political and economic sistem to the game and add a few varibles afterwards ( i.e . : political movements and private enterprise ) . 5- Customization : It is now impossible to customize the game , like create new units as it was possible in CIV 2 . I hate that ! 6- Maps : Lacks a map of earth ! It used to be the only map I played on in CIV 2 ! IMPROVEMENTS 1- Graphics : Way better than the predecessors . Too bad that the other features in the game did n't get quite to the same level ! 2- Soundtrack : Improved somehow . 3- Combat : A tactical display now allows you to actually play battles . Nice idea to start with , but it is somehow badly put to work and has some incredible bugs ( like archers that shoot down stealth bombers ! ) .My suggestion ? Wayt for a sequel or buy CIV 2 !	-1
Why did n't I just read the packaging and put it down . No , I had to go and buy it . I played Civ II once , Alpha Centauri two or three times , and now Call to Power ... well , I did n't make it through the tutorial.One word ... ZZZZZZZZZZZ !	-1
This game calls its civilizations & quot ; races & quot ; and has slavery as a prominet part of the game , but there is the abolition eventually . It does not feel like a successor to Civilization II . The wonders of the world are all new , as is the technology tree . The interface is new , and you can not use a keyboard to move units . I did not care much for its supposedly improved graphics over Civilization II , I did not see that much improvement , and by now the graphics are not cutting edge anyway.There are too many new units and cumbersome rules associated with them . The cursed televangelist keeps popping up out of nowhere , converting cities and eating into your empire 's resources . The lawyer hides just as you are about to move a military unit to kill him . Building cities in space and under water may sound like a lot of fun and a novelty compared to the two original Civilizations . But playing at lower levels , this wo n't be interesting , becuase you will learn how to crush your opponents before acquiring the technology for underwater and space construction ; at higher levels , the game becomes too difficult and too cluttered with units and characters to persevere with marine and space existence . The only real improvement over Civilization II is that governments are more stable during war . In Civ II , if you wanted to wage a serious war , you had to install monarchy or fundamentalism , or your government would collapse . Bottom line : maybe it 's because I am older , but I did not enjoy this game as much as Civilization II . What comes out of & quot ; Call to Power & quot ; screams for help to bring more original and well-crafted games to the market .	-1
Sid Meier is a true artist in the realm of software , but with each new addition to the Civilization family the games become more oriented toward conflict and less fun to play . In AC the Believers will appear on your borders within the first 50 turns and you will never really be at peace again . Forget about the fun of managing a nation : this is a non-stop Darwinian struggle to keep your head above water . ( Some players might like this , but I find it tedious . ) There 's no point in trying to negotiate with other factions because they 'll just turn right around and violate your territory or declare war . Then after you have spent decades trying to build up your industry , when your output reaches a certain level the planet itself will being to attack you with an inexhaustible supply of mindworms . *Every* game of AC is a race to achieve the victory conditions before the planet itself defeats you , and there 's not much sense of satisfaction in that . Add to this the fact that the game runs unbearably slowly . You will spend more time watching units go plod-plod-plod across the screen than you will playing . I really wanted to like this game , but after a while its defeatist atmosphere and tedious play just got too wearisome . Let 's hope that in his next game Side remembers that growing an empire is more fun and challenging than beating one .	-1
Awful ! A real disapointment . This game is confusing and boring much like civilization 2 . The game cover made it sound much more exciting than it really was . I bought it a while ago from Rinho and it was bran new then . I was sooo dissapointed . It takes forever to play , the battles are cheesy and a waste of time . If you are considering buying this game , I reccomend you try it before you buy it . Belive me it 's not even worth $ 5 . I 've always been dissapointed with Sid Meier 's games . So I think I 'll stop trying them . If your considering this game , try Imperium Galactica 2 . It 's awsome . No comparison . I hope you found this reveiw helpful .	-1
I was a big fan of Parappa the Rapper and I was seriously disappointed with this sequel . It 's bad enough that you can beat it in 30 minutes , but what 's worse is that you would n't want to ! The music is just bad and that is inexcusable for a music game . Where are all the catchy tunes ? I ca n't remember one line from this game , whereas I have all of Parappa the Rapper 's songs memorized . It 's missing those great lyrics found in Parappa like my favorite : & quot ; Sunny in my life , she 's like a dice , I ca n't tell which way to turn 'till I spice ! & quot ; Skip UmJammer and get Parappa .	-1
I would rent this game . It takes no skills what so ever to beat it . Maybe it just came naturally to me , or maybe I 'm just to critical but this game is not worth buying . In my opinion this game would only appeal the the 8-11 age range and even then would they only play it once or twice .	-1
I have most of the major flight sims and now I have this and have only worked with it a bit but I find it a little too overcomplicated , it 's taxing even for someone who is a flight simmer and is already flight tested and combat tested.The graphics are good but first there was the necessity to download a patch which at 25mb is the largest game patch I 've ever seen , the list of fixes is enough to make you question why they released it in that form anyway.Although the amount of interactivity is less with the bombers in Janes Attack Squadron so is the level of overhead.If you are really a B17 nut though and you want total realistic immersion in that plane then you 'll like the sim .	-1
It does n't make any sense . How can this game be considered a classic ? It has WAY too many flaws for people to continue naming it `` best game of all-time '' or `` best Castlevania game you 'll ever play '' .I do n't think so . If you want a `` real '' Castlevania game , go play Castlevania 64 for the N64 . That 's how a Castlevania game should be done . Not like Symphony Of The Night , which is basically a complete disaster with its many inexplicable problems.Do n't believe me ? You will soon enough . First and foremost , Konami must think all Castlevania fans are forgetful and dumb . You see , the game begins with you playing as Richter , and you 're back in the final stage of the previous Castlevania game fighting Dracula . This is ridiculous . I do n't want to play THAT game , I want to play Symphony Of The Night . You do n't have to redo the final fight with Wart in the beginning of Super Mario Bros. 3 . So you should n't have to start off Symphony Of The Night by going back and fighting the final boss in the previous game . What the hell is wrong with Konami ? This whole Richter/Dracula thing should have been removed.After that 's over , the REAL game begins , but unfortunately that 's not true . It does n't begin yet . Immediately a screen is shown of Alucard running to the castle ( which you unfortunately have no control over ) . Once he 's inside and the gate closes , you can now play as him , but wait a minute . There 's no music playing in the background . A game ca n't really start if there 's no music , because the absence of music makes a game feel empty and unexciting.Luckily , my worst fear did n't come true ( that Konami forgot to put music in the game ) and you just have to move forward a few steps and battle a few more foes before the music kicks in . It 's about time ! You had me worried there ! But then more problems arise . In the same little area where the music kicks in , you encounter these zombies that come out of the ground and walk towards you , and many times you never see these zombies coming until it 's too late and you take a hit . Pesky little things like this are just one of many reasons this game is almost completely unbearable.Eventually you meet up with a young lady named Maria . She 's extremely attractive , and knows just how to push the right flirting buttons . And that 's a big problem . The way she seems to come on to Alucard and practically drool all over him is such a turn-on to the player that it 's very difficult to move forward and continue on with the quest . After a Maria encounter , you ca n't stop thinking about her beautiful pale face , those big beautiful eyes , that smooth relaxing voice , and so then what happens after that is , when you are in the middle of a serious battle , you almost always die because you ca n't stop thinking about Maria 's beautiful face.Konami must not understand that mostly boys play video games . I should n't have to say it , but I think it 's obvious that the creators of Maria are disappointed in themselves for creating such a good-looking woman , because one look at Maria distracts boys everywhere . They should n't have made her look so pretty . Because of this , only the strongest male gamers will be able to complete this Castlevania adventure . Had she been less attractive , guys would be able to better concentrate on the game.You 're probably thinking by now `` Alright , talk about the actual GAME ! '' Okay , I will , but you wo n't like what I have to say . It 's just really painful for me to pick out all the problems in this supposed classic . Basically , it all boils down to one thing . The fact that some weapons in this game are incredibly slow , weak and almost useless . Yes , I 'm talking about the Jewel Sword and the Sword Of Hador . Konami never should have put these two weapons in the game . But because they did , we have no choice but to put up with them , and I have no choice but to complain . These two weapons really drag the game down.I could go on and on about the many problems you will see in this game . Twice in the game you will have to fight a guy who looks exactly like you , which if you ask me , lacks creativity . Konami wasted a good opportunity right there to come up with new and exciting bosses to fight , but no , they had to go with the old predictable mirror match.Many enemies have blood fiercely squirting out of their bodies when you attack them , forcing me and my children to look away from the TV screen . Because me and my children understand that if we look at the screen and see this violence , we will throw up all over ourselves and even worse , we might even have trouble making it through the day without screaming in fear that the same brutal treatment might happen to us if we 're not careful . A little bit of blood is fine , but some of the blood in Symphony Of The Night is a bit too graphic and plentiful . It 's enough to terrorize you . So the best thing to do would be to try and jump over these bloody enemies so you wo n't have to attack them , though in many places , avoiding enemies wo n't be easy.Finally , the biggest problem . The second castle in the game is just the first castle turned upside down , so it 's not really a new castle . Now that 's what I call clumsy . Between the smutty actions of Maria and the blood all over the place , it feels like I 'm watching a porno blood fest . Not a pretty thought , is it ? So as you can see , many problems prevent this game from being a classic . Do n't even think about buying it .	-1
WTF is this crap , this is metroid not castlevainia ... ... this sucks . PS stop making castlevainia into gay manga garbage it takes all the thrills and scary aspects out of it by making everyone look like a woman with multi colored hair .	-1
This game is very difficult to control and it is extremely boring . It may have been a great game six years ago , but by today 's standards this one is a definite loser . Save your money .	-1
I grew up playing this game as a kid , so after buying this game in this day and age I really tried hard to like it . I really did , but I just couldn't.I remember playing this on DOS with the joystick . The graphics are a little better then I remembered it and the playstation control is a lot easier to handle than a joystick . The level design is also very retro and original . You simply do n't get such dark , dysptopianish , techno inspired level design like this anymore . Speaking of techno , the soundtrack allthough very short is simply the best soundtrack of the entire Wipeout franchise . Messhja being the best song in my opinion.Now where this game sadly suffers is the gameplay.Anti-Grav racing has gotten faster as time moves on and as a result the original Wipeout simply has n't aged that well . You simply move too slow in this game . So slow that your thumb will actually start to feel sore after two races . I ca n't even play this game with the X button as the thrust anymore . I have to use the Triangle button , but that is not even the worst aspect of this game . The worst is that fact that your ship loses all of its speed every single time you miss a turn or bump into an enemy ship and that 's another problem . Nothing is more annoying in this game then having to pass another ship and have that ship bump into you slowing you down . A more minor issue I have with this game is all the weapon effects just look boring and uninspired looking . If I 'm shooting rockets or missles I want to see a lot more than just a small cloud of dust . I want to see some sorta projectile and explosion.Overall I only recemend playing this game if you never experienced the later Wipeouts especially Wipeout Fusion . Once you play Fusion this game becomes pretty much unplayable .	-1
i saw the TV comercial for this game and it looked pretty cool but when i got it for christmas it got very boring i mean all u do is try to get to the other end of the level with ur ball and collect cards so there is n't much to this game i would n't reccomend this game 2 many people	-1
Ok so i get the idea that you are a glove rolling on a ball . Hmmmm . Ok well here goes . If you liked this game , you are an IDIOT ! HELLO GUYS YOU ARE A GLOVE ! WHAT THE HECK IVE NEVER HEARD OF SUCH AN IDIOTIC CHARACTER ! A GLOVE ! FOR GOODNESS SAKES , IVE HEARD THAT ORIGINALITY IS GOOD , BUT THIS ? ok i will stop yelling . But jeeze guys cant you see that only some kind of fool would actually enjoy playing as a glove that can balance on a ball ? Well I can . So I 'm out , enough said .	-1
This game can be described in a few simple words , boring , repeaditive , bad , pointless .	-1
Well , it wo n't work at all . I put it in my console , and nothing . I looked it over carefully to make sure I did n't buy some ... knock off , but it even has etched trademarks , ext . It does n't recognize the disk at all . So I went to the Activision site to see if I could find some help on this game . And this is what they said ... ProblemDoes not load and play.SolutionActivision has identified a manufacturing problem with regards to its Dreamcast title Blue Stinger . The manufacturing issue involves only a limited percentage of the total product available in stores , but will result in start-up failure on certain Dreamcast systems.If you experience this problem , we encourage you to call 1-888-402-8951 and The Blue Stinger Hotline will send you a new disc free of charge . You will be asked to return the faulty copy of Blue Stinger directly to the fulfillment house . A prepaid , self-addressed mailer will be provided for their convenience.Activision is dedicated to promptly delivering replacement discs to affected consumers . We would like to extend an apology to you for the inconvenience , but are confident that once this problem is corrected , you will have an outstanding gaming experience with Blue Stinger and the Dreamcast hardware.So , I just wanted to post this for anyone else that has this problem , or will have this problem in the future . So far I have only got their answering machine . Let 's see if they are still supporting this title and call me back : o ) CraigUPDATE : Talked to someone from Activision . He was kinda floored that there were still faulty copies out there : o ) Guess it 's been awhile since it was out . Anyway , they replaced it as promised . But , the games really [ stinks ] ! ! ! Do n't bother . It 's been a while since I even had my Dreamcast hooked up , so I do n't remember what it was that I did n't like about the game . But , I do remember that I knew this was a really bad game in about ten minutes of playing it . Was n't even worth my time getting it replaced .	-1
I have played few games that were as funny as this one . Why ? Take a bunch of game developers who hated the average controls of survival horror games , get a bunch of inept writers to scribble down a derivative plot with a nice hook and horrible dialogue , music composers who aspire to be better than John Williams , game designers who played WAY too many Super Mario games and anyone in marketing or professional game reviewing to pass the game off as a Survival Horror game and you 've got a painfully hilarious game on your hands . This game does n't do Sega any justice and do n't believe the lie that this was their first Survival Horror game , they made their first two years before this on the Saturn and that game , Deep Fear , was art compared to this . I felt absolutely lied to when I played this game thinking I was in for the scare of my life when I found myself rolling on the ground after witnessing some of the silliest character models , inconsistent soundtrack , awkward dialogue , non-existent atmosphere , incomprehensible plot and obnoxious controls I 've ever played on a DreamCast game . Your characters run so slow you 'd think they had weights tied to their ankles , but their steps look so played out it 's almost like they 're waddling away from danger ! You 'll kill monsters who , despite being four legged monstrosities , will literally sprinkle you with gold coins ! The overly dramatic music will play on and loop over and over again when nothing is happening ! You want a farce ? You 've got nothing but farce in Blue Stinger .	-1
People saying this a perfect game are either skateboarders are just crazy . This game is so outdated graphics are horrible , gameplay is decent at best . there is no reason this should have higher then 3 stars and for that reason I am giving it a 1 , so people will know it 's not a 4 or 5 out of 5 star game .	-1
Loser ! The cars in this game do n't leave behind any dust , they bite the dust ! It 's no wonder that Activision did n't dare tie this game directly into Interstate '76 . There is just no comparison to the classic game . I would love to compare this game but since Activision is n't doing that I wo n't either . Let 's go down the list of Graphics , Control , Game Play , Sound/Music , and Fun Factor . That will give or take one star for each category.Graphics : Where does one start on the graphics ? As far as the level of detail and the amount of destruction available , it is indeed a very good game . Games of this nature tend to over simplified with little or no detail in the buildings and surrounding terrain . Activision programmers spent a lot of time on the details in the game , I wish they spent the same amount of time on the game 's engine . The game engine plays like a first generation game . There is such an incredible amount of popping , crazing , stretching , and disappearing polygons , any good programmer should have never allowed this kind of thing to even leave his development PC . For those out of the loop I 'll define the problems.Popping- Terrain popping up out of no where . Programmers usually solve this with careful use of fog . Yes folks , that is the true use of fog . However fog in this game is under utilized . Almost like it was thrown in at the last minute.Crazing/Stretching- This tends to be very similar . Various walls or architecture seems to twist or stretch into bizarre angles . If you have the game drive the car directly up against a vertical wall and you 'll see it . The level with the lighthouse is a prime example.Disappearing polygons- This is a serious no no in games . Drive to the edge of any arena until the car & quot ; bounces & quot ; if you can get the proper slope of land ( about a 45 degree angle . ) and the camera swings low enough , parts of the ground will disappear and be replaced by a livid blue ( or red depending on the generation of PSX console or some other factor ) .Control : Unfortunately , this game ca n't decide on Arcadian controls or Real World controls , so it attempts to do a half and half deal . The car 's accelerates and steers like it 's running through molasses , unless of course it floats , then it feels like it 's skimming around on ice . In fact , control 's so bad that I tend to get and use the hovercraft mode or the boat mode more often than not . The only major saving grace is that the controls are 100 % configurable . I myself do n't like the default uses for the buttons . Especially for my style of play which involves using my thumb to press two or three buttons at the same time . ( Old School Mario Style if you will . ) Gameplay : Game play is frustrating at best . ( Why is the & quot ; Arcade & quot ; mode listed before & quot ; Quest & quot ; mode ? ) The various modes of the game should be fun , but really , are more of a frustrating exercise in patience . Past experience tells me that arcade mode is a great way to & quot ; practice & quot ; the details of the game . In this case , it actually is set up that way . Hints and tips are handed to you before each battle . Cars can be limited in number and difficulty . And goals are clearly defined . However , actually doing all of this takes a bit of work . The number of & quot ; configuration & quot ; screens one must churn through is heart breaking . Whatever happened to a & quot ; simple & quot ; game session ? And the enemies seem to be overly ruthless . Whereas quest mode seems to be the easiest of the modes , having blasted through 4 of the drivers in the first few hours of playing . I really did n't have much patience to even try the survival mode.Sound/Music : I try not to review music or sound in games but in this case it will be the only whole star for this game . The music is indeed sweet to listen to . The tunes are strangely familiar , but I ca n't place my finger on it . It also appears that there is one song for each of the characters to play . The book lists 15 characters and I believe there are 15 songs . It 's quite fun to try and match the songs to the characters . The music would have been a blast if they used real world 70 's music but alas , the licensing would be too much . The only annoying sound effect is those stinkin ' UFO 's . Kind of makes me want to turn the CD into a UFO.Fun Factor : Fun Factor ca n't get much lower . The only fun things here is the quest mode and two player mode . It 's always nice to play ANY game with two players , especially one that lets us rag on it like it 's Elevator Action ( Waaay back in the NES days . ) The quest mode is nice for those late night no-brainer sessions where your brain is too fried to think about anything else.Sorry if this review is just as jumbled as the game itself . Watching the game world twist and spin in sickening ways scrambled my poor brain . The results ? Half a star for graphics but bad engine . No stars for the controls . No stars for game play . One star for music and sound . And half a star for the fun factor . That 's all . Hope Activision 's third attempt is n't a . . . dump .	-1
I do n't think I 've ever been as angry with any software as I was with Messiah . After an hour of dying around every corner or in certain parts on the FIRST level , I immediately uninstalled it and returned it . It is my policy that any game that just about FORCES you to cheat is a bad game . Yes , the graphics in this game are good , and yes , the possession ability is an innovative thing , but all of that is WORTHLESS when you get killed so easily . 1-3 hits is all it takes , and when your host dies , expect Bob to die nanoseconds later . Even if you 're a crackshot and can kill a person without making a sound , reinforcements appear almost instantly and kill you just as quickly . The message here is that combat is best avoided ... so why am I constantly thrusted into it ? And the AI ? Superb , yet stupid at the same time . I accidentally went into combat mode with my fists at one time , and armed guards from across the ( very large ) room suddenly started shooting me ! Also , when I possessed a commander , a COMMANDER , for crying out loud , my own soldiers shot me anyway , AND I WAS N'T IN COMBAT MODE ! So I figure either A ) They have a & quot ; jealous & quot ; behavior , or B ) They 're stupid . Also , the possession ability is an innovation , but you 'll get so frustrated that you 'll hardly give it a second thought when you uninstall it . I do n't even want to think about the later levels that have you going against demons ! My conclusion is ... if you 're tired of the usual & quot ; shoot , run , repeat & quot ; games , and you 're desperate for a change in 3D shooters ... stick with & quot ; Thief : The Dark Project. & quot ; Let this game die in piece .	-1
Messiah is a third person game . Set in the future you play an angel called Bob sent from god to save the world from the bad humans . The angel is very small and weak , It can be easily killed , but it can posses any charecter it wants and take control of the charecter , Only after becoming someone it can carry weapons . The graphics and sound are average , charecter animation are not very impressive . Messiah 's problems is that it is quite difficult , To posses someone you need to fly behind him and jump into his back and that is very hard to do so because of the third person camera angle . The game is quite short too .	-1
This expansion pack ( EP ) was a complete wast of my time , and money . It adds a couple new magical weapons and armor , some new spells and a couple new areas to explore . There is no plot to the the EP , just some NPC saying & quot ; Oh I lost my son in Durlags Tower . . . . & quot ; and stuff like that . The only thing that made this EP worth two stars is that they cleaned up a lot of the rough edges from Baldurs Gate , and increased Experience points to a point where your fighter and like one other class can go up a level . By the way , it is just one more disk that you have to flip through if you decide to replay Baldurs Gate . In conclusion do n't buy this EP , it is n't worth it , unless any new EP 's come out that require it .	-1
i do n't know why others rate this so highly - the graphics are OK , i love the fact that you can play with friends ( although in the end are different schedules ruined this ) and i like importing my own pictures . But the controls for this game are absolutely frustrating ! Some minor gripes : the manual does n't have enough info , combat used to be a MAJOR pain until i stumbled over the pause commands ( and had to play with them to figure out which ones to set ) , having the main character enter a store makes life frustrating for other LAN players , the plot does n't seem multiplayer friendly ( you lose all those NPCs which are important to the story - the party is so small ) , the maps do n't make a ton of sense , group movement can be really annoying and my number one complaint : you ca n't use arrow keys to move your character ! i know , it sounds minor , but the view screen is only large enough to show a few tiles , so you have to scroll the screen , click a destination point , by which time your guy has already walked there so you scroll some more , repeat - it gets so that you never actually see your character because you 're so busy setting way points for him to walk . At a minimum , if you have to play this carpal-tunnel torture of moving your characters leg by leg , you should at least be able to make the screen center on the character - the little guy just walks off the screen and you do n't know where he went . At a minimum , let me see more of the map at one time - i have a 19 & quot ; monitor and prefer looking at what 's happening rather than the large pretty pictures some artist drew.The plot 's OK , the D & amp ; D system is pretty sophisticated , there 's some real polish in places and we 've needed a good RPG for a while ( i LOVED Fallout , which had lousy , but still vastly superior , map and movement controls ) , so i got the game the very first day it was released ( xmas eve ) , and my roommates and i played it for 2 weeks , but eventually i got so sick of the control scheme that i just erased the frustrating thing	-1
I enjoy RPG games . Really , I do . But for some reason , I could n't get into this one as much as I thought I could . But I 've looked at all the reviews on this board , and most are raving about it . But what I 'm also wondering is if these very positive reviews are from mostly die-hard RPGers , and/or Dungeon & amp ; Dragons fans.I personally do not play D & amp ; D , so I 'm not a die-hard . But I did enjoy Diablo , Everquest , Might and Magic 7 , and Age of Wonders , so I 'm not against & quot ; dungeon-crawl & quot ; /fantasy type games as you may think I am . I did like the & quot ; pause & quot ; option in Baldur 's Gate , so you can give commands to each of your party 's members without getting thrashed in the meantime , but I did n't care for the graphics . But to some , that 's minor and forgivable if you like the gameplay -- I guess I just did n't . I also prefer faster paced games with a more linear storyline . But if you prefer a non-linear storyline , and sometimes feeling semi-lost in a rather large world to explore , that 's all the more reason for you to get this game.I also get a tired of too much repitition . Every battle I set my formation up , pause , issue relatively the same commands , and execute . ( In Everquest , I only went up to Level 12 and quit , thinking , what 's the point ? ) So the combat is repetitive , but in Baldur 's defense , it does have a storyline and an ending , unlike Everquest . But it is time consuming . But if you can afford the time , and you like RPG 's , then you 'll love this title , otherwise , spend your gaming money elsewhere .	-1
Maybe it is because I have a Mac version but I was really really enjoying this game when my band of characters stopped going up in experience levels . I contacted the company but was told that that is just the way the game is . Yes , I do like a challenge but I play computer games to relax too and without an advancement in level I do n't see how to win this game . I was very very disappointed .	-1
I bought this game for my 7 year old son , expecting it to be a good one . The graphics are average ( better graphics can be found with Spyro , year of the dragon ) , and the levels are very frustrating , I found myself throwing the controller away several times trying to help my son get through the levels , even though I consider myself a good gamer . I finally recommended my son to play Spyro the dragon instead to avoid anymore frustrations . I wo n't recommend anyone to get this game .	-1
Okay . This game ... If you think this game is good , play Tony Hawk 's Pro Skater 2 and see what you think after that . This game lacks good graphics and does n't have enough tricks to keep you awake . I mean , come on ! One lip trick ? ! Tony Hawk 's Pro Skater 2 has plenty of lip tricks , grab tricks , flip tricks , and specials . Plus , on Pro Skater 2 you have the ability to decide what tricks are performed for which button . If you are a true Tony Hawk fan , do n't get this game . It will upset you to much .	-1
horrible graphics , mindless games , hnow the heck did u give it 5 stars ? ? ?	-1
A lot of good reviews -- two perfect 5 star reviews even . Amazon.com gets to choose which reviews are `` featured '' , so that 's not really much of a surprise.You should definitely read more reviews . The graphics are okay , but the design of the graphics in this game are considered to be very cartoonish by many . Bright oranges , glowing blues , and odd color assortments await you in this game . Do yourself a favor and search for the original Battlezone . That was a game I played so many years ago I ca n't even remember when , but I remember clearly the missions and the specific gameplay elements because it was so good . The story made more sense , the missions did n't tell you exactly what to do ( you had to figure it out , which was the fun part ) , and the overhead map was accessible from the push of a button rather than getting out of your vehicle all of the time . To summarize what these reviews ( on the first page ) are all leaving out : - You 'll have to get out of your vehicle constantly . Because the drivers of other vehicles just are n't smart enough to do the job themselves . You 'll also have to do this to access the tactical map , the only way of ordering units around without actually driving there ( by which time the units in question will have already been destroyed , too little , too late ) - Missions are n't involving , and the story does n't continue from the original game . In short , there 's really not much of a story , as you 'll find yourself doing strange things that you 've been ordered to do for no apparent reason- Interface is cluttered , buttons rearrange themselves based on the order that you built things , and it 's a nightmare finding the right keys to press during the heat of battle . In many games , the only deciding factor of whether you 'll win or lose is if you find the right keys fast enough	-1
Ok , by reading the reviews of the people here , I can see someone has figured this game out . I bought it not realizing it had missions where you had to do certian thing at certain times . I thought this was going to more of a graphics rich version of Dune 2000 or Tiberian Sun ... was I dissapointed.It takes forever just to get to play a mission . The mission starts loading up and someone starts talking , I guess giving a little story to the mission you are about to play . But , I can see that it 's all loaded up within a few seconds , but the person just keeps talking . I ca n't get it to skip past that so I can go ahead a play . This is very frustrating . In a nutshell , I stopped trying to figure it out and went on to buy another game to play . Get something else , this sucks .	-1
Is it possible for a game to be TOO realistic ? The graphics are excellent , and there 's a lot of bass to everything . Now , shall I go into the negative parts ? I 'm against the claim that video games cause violence in the populace , but this game nearly changed my opinion . In Kingpin , it 's & quot ; f-this & quot ; and & quot ; f-that , & quot ; and & quot ; Do n't look at my ( expletive ) . & quot ; Even casual talk has the F-word butting into the conversation , and I was very disgusted with the conversations that my character engaged in . I returned the game soon after I installed it because I thought the & quot ; gritty & quot ; subject matters detracted from the & quot ; fun factor & quot ; of the game . How can one have fun cussing and killing other people that cuss back ? Sure , Quake and other games are violent , but not as wanton , gratuitous , and obscene as THIS game . I admit that I like some violence , but not even *I* would defend Kingpin from accusations of youth violence . Aside from that , bullets leave exit marks on the opponents , but so does the crowbar , the levels are very confusing , making you run in circles , and objectives are very vague . Heed the rather large warning labels on the box PLEASE . This game is DEFINETELY NOT for kids ... and even some grown-ups !	-1
This game could do alot better than it really did . It takes way to long to build something or to train something . But it has a good storyline where its humans against orcs . I do enjoy watching them battle it out and ending in a gory death . The land isnt detailed enough . What this game lacks is details .	-1
I never could get this game chugging on more than one cylinder . The manual is irrevelant and no outside game helps are published ( I 've looked for more than a year ) . Play the stockmarket ? ? ? Forget about it ... If you are not into the esoterica of steam trains or stupid country music , the computer steals the fun and always has you dead to rights . Historical trade and industrial patterns are treated very lightly indeed . I like to able to play the game , but I could n't make it do anything .	-1
I got this game for ten bucks on the bargain pile . It blows it is a boring extremely hard game . I liked the movie option , graphics and real car phisics . The story was okay not great . The controls were horrible . The missions are extremely unforgiving and hard boring . The first mission took us 3 weeks to fufill . Also your stuck in the car driving around . The missions are so hard by the time you know how to beat them its just memerizing a boring path . It 's not even challenging fun . It is more like boring impossible ! ! Also you ca n't see in front of you . I 'm still on the first city . On the good side you can go to a option you have called take a ride which allows you to go out and wreck havac in the city and have cops chase and then turn the car chases into movies . Also there are driving games like pursuit and Getaway , carnage , surviver and time trials ect . There fun for a while you can also turn them into movies . Also I think this has much improovement from the PS1 version by far . But still this game is horrible . The story mode is by far the most hard boring and unforgiving I 've ever seen . If you want a fun wide variety driving game for the PC reserve GTA3.Pros : Lot 's of non story gamesGood GraphicsWay better than PS1 versionThere is movie editorReal Car fisicsSome might like StoryCons : Boringly Hard Story ModeBad ControlsGame is Uneccesasseraly hardCan only stay in carHuge lack of Mission VarietyLarge Lack of Car VarietyGame gets incredably boring and hardMissions very unforgivingProbily takes at minimum 15 restarts to complete a average missionsCops will start a dangerous car chase for speeding and do n't stop when you stop to themCops to easily provokedCops go to dangerous lenghts to get you for a minor violation.Unrealistic and Dangerous Cop AICa n't run over PadestriansSo if you want a wide variety driving game where you can get out of a car and get in another and more mission variety reserve GTA3 .	-1
This popular title has a lot going for it - good graphics , excellent maneuvering and physics , and style to boot.However , the difficulty is much too high for even heardcore gamers . There seems to be something truly amiss with the makers of the game - despite the negative comments regarding gameplay , the game 's sequel , Driver 2 ( PSX ) is actually harder than the original.In order to make the game playable , you either have to apply a patch released by Infrogrames or play in cheat mode . Then it will become only _barely_ playable.Unless you can find a cheap copy , avoid .	-1
This rumble pak is too big , uses up batteries rapidly , it 's so heavy that you hardly ever feel the rumble , Nintendo should have built-in rumble in thre controllers this sucks .	-1
Updated review- March 20 , 2007I was completely wrong about Metal Gear Solid . I 've really grown to change my mind about the negative thoughts I once had and NOW I think Metal Gear Solid deserves 5 stars ( 4.5 to be exact ) . I especially grew to appreciate the main purpose of the game which is , as many have already mentioned , being encouraged to AVOID the guards that appear on your radar . The idea of the game is to find ways to avoid enemies- not just go in and attempt to either shoot or break their necks . No wonder I originally gave the game a low rating . I went in expecting to kill everything that walked in my way ! The gameplay is a radically different approach from anything I 've ever experienced before.I originally said Metal Gear Solid was one of those games I respect more than I enjoy . I said this because so much thought and energy went into the storyline and voice acting , that I felt the game deserved to be respected , and Konami deserved credit for making it.However , playing the game today for the first time in months , I do n't know what happened . When I hit the triangle button to put myself in first-person mode , and looked across the hallway to see if a guard happened to be standing there ( or walking towards me ) I got caught up in the excitement and the quiet atmosphere of trying to find a way around him . It was addicting . I finally figured out how to break their necks and that was a lot of fun , too . The boss fights are actually the very best thing about Metal Gear Solid . Every single one of them is fun , not to mention they all require you to figure out the best way to defeat them using your rather large selection of guns and figuring out which gun is the correct one . I love fighting that ninja without using weapons and hearing him speak between the action segments . Hearing enemies talk while you 're fighting them makes you want to kick their butts even MORE ! I also love when everything is nice and quiet , and then you accidentally walk right by a guard . When this happens , a loud sound effect comes in that gives off a feeling of `` Oops , my bad ! '' because now the guard is chasing you around . You now have to run for your life . I did n't realize last year that this is actually a lot of fun . This IS a really good game . I 'm sorry for saying it was average last year . Sometimes I need to actually PLAY a game before speaking my mind.Metal Gear Solid is the revolutionary Playstation game that showed the world a new , life-like way to play video games in the late 90 's . The influence this game had on the future of video gaming is simply astounding . Metal Gear Solid showed how you can take stealth fighting and wrap a gigantic , memorable story around it . While I 'm not a big fan of lengthy twists and turns in video game storylines , I will give Konami a lot of respect for putting an *incredible* amount of time and effort into the game , and in the process , having the Metal Gear Solid series continue to do well on the Playstation 2 , and soon , Playstation 3.I especially like the quiet atmosphere while you try finding ways to walk around guards . It comes off like you 're watching a movie instead of playing a video game , or , to put it another way , you 're `` playing '' a movie . Not many people can create an atmosphere quite like this . Good job Konami.Sometimes the guards are n't as intelligent as you 'd like them to be ( you can actually walk into an elevator and they will walk right by , without noticing you ) and apparently none of them can see you if you 're standing only a couple feet away , but you know , these problems are actually pretty nice because it allows gamers to finish Metal Gear Solid without any major difficulty problems . I can only imagine how hard the game would be if guards were extremely observant all the time.I still have a problem with the overall darkness of the game , though . More often than not , an important health or ammo pack is located in a hidden dark area , like near a corner , behind a crate or somewhere you ca n't see . It 's really not a big deal , though . Just remind yourself to always check every dark area you come across . If you 're still having trouble finding items , just press the triangle button to put yourself in first-person mode , and hit the left or right buttons on the directional pad to scan around . This works really well . In fact , the whole first-person camera angle was a great idea from Konami.Even though 20 minutes of cutscenes and conversations is n't really my thing , at least you are given the option to skip through them if you want ( by pressing any one of the four main buttons , plus the Start button ) . I hate when game companies FORCE you to watch them . I do n't think the storyline is bad in any shape or form . It 's actually decent . You see , my whole life I 've had a belief that a video game should be more about actually `` playing a game '' and less time should be devoted to storyline segments ( I 'll make an exception for RPGs ) . The storyline in Metal Gear Solid is so big and lengthy that if you were to sit there and listen to the whole thing you would be sitting there for HOURS . Honestly , Metal Gear Solid focuses more on storyline than actual gameplay.With changing times and technology , people began to prefer the realistic aspects of video gaming . Metal Gear Solid will go down as one of the originators.I DO have one complaint- there does n't seem to be an option for you to lock-on to your target , so YOU are forced to find and face the target . For example , if a guard is located south/east of you , you have to actually use the directional pad to face south/east and THEN you can shoot him . You have to face him directly or he 'll continue shooting at you until you 're dead . This can be a pain because turning correctly is a bit of a challenge . This could have been fixed with one simple `` lock-on nearest target '' feature.Sure , you have guns that can zoom in on a target , but to use THESE guns you have to get into a special position ( which changes the angle of the camera ) . By the time you get into that position the guard will have already killed you because it takes a few seconds to get into that position , and believe me , you do n't have a SECOND to waste once a guard spots you . I want a gun that features a QUICK lock-on target ( such as a gun with high amounts of firepower and frequently-available ammo packs ) . That way it wo n't feel hopeless when a million guards are after me.Besides a bit of overall darkness , a lengthy storyline and sometimes unfair situations regarding aiming and shooting , I have no other problems with the game . These are really minor problems and it 's easy for me to look past them . A game that I SHOULD have given more attention to before attempting to give a final verdict . Metal Gear Solid is a classic game . It just took me a while to see that .	-1
I rue the day this title came out for Playstation . It was considered so original , it influenced many , many stealth-type games that followed it . Too many.Where do I start with the things I hate about this game ? 1 . It 's way too difficult . You get awfully sick of hearing `` Snaaaaaaaaaaaaaake ! '' every 10 seconds . There should have been a way to ratchet down the difficulty even further for 'tards like me . `` Easy '' mode really is n't . Sheesh . I wonder what `` Hard '' mode was like.2 . Way too many cutscenes ! I 've never seen anything like it . There 's one cut scene that goes on for like 30 minutes . This has got to be the talkiest video game I 've ever played . And these dialogues are all so silly , and you 're pretty much forced to watch them or you wo n't be able to understand what 's going on . In fact , I would say that most of your time in this game will be spent watching cutscenes . It 's not so much a video game as a movie in which you are occasionally allowed to press buttons.3 . I hate video games that wo n't let you pause at certain moments , as this wo n't . I would n't advise playing this if you have a wife or mother who 's gon na occasionally ask you to help her in the kitchen : you 'll find yourself saying , `` Yeah , I 'll help you after this scene finishes . . . in about half an hour ! Not allowed to pause it for some reason ! '' 4 . Even more excusably , there 's not way to pause the cutscenes . You ca n't even pause the codec dialogues ! 5 . There are many scenes in which the game disables your weapons and accessories for no logical reason other than that if it did n't , the scene would be too easy.6 . There are far too many boss monsters . It 's like every other encounter is a boss monster . The first part of the game ( say , up until the first encounter with Revolver Ocelot ) is pretty great , but that 's not representative of the game : after that it 's basically an unending series of boss monsters.7 . Frustratingly , you have to fight several boss monsters twice because they never seem to die . Having to `` kill '' the same boss monster over and over again makes you feel like you 're going in circles.8 . The principals having these deep discussions about delicate emotional issues while an enemy is shooting at them or while a timer is ticking down . Was this written by a 14-year-old ? 9 . The system for flattening oneself against a wall is not ready for prime time : most of the time you find yourself flattened against the wall and you did n't mean to do this . This will get you killed several times as you are thus basically standing still , allowing your enemies to shoot you . It should have been running up to a wall in combination with pressing L1 or something.10 . The way your guy stands there uselessly for about two seconds after choking somebody.11 . The way you can easily bypass critical lifesaving devices , such as the thermal goggles.12 . The way the game takes all these cheap shots at you : you ca n't look ahead because your radar is `` jammed '' and then you get shot by a security camera . Or blown up by a mine.13 . The way you are prevented , after having killed a boss , from going back into the battle area and collecting the stuff you did n't collect during the battle . Is it there or not ? So why ca n't I get it now ? 14 . The absurd anti-nuclear message at the game 's finale .	-1
This game is fun to play , but the graphics are terrible . The terrain is green , with some very sparsely placed trees and signs . It is fun to beat down other racers with pipe , chain , hammer , etc ... but the bikes are nearly impossible to control at full speed . The expansion pack for the N64 is the biggest waste of money i 've ever spent . It does NOTHING to help the graphics or sound quality . multi-player saves it from the graveyard .	-1
I read lots of great reviews for this game that made me want to play it . It will not play on my XP . Talked to a lot of other gamers that tried to help but nothing worked . Am holding onto it in case I can get a chance to play it on another computer . I do n't think it is XP compatible .	-1
I saw this game , rented it from the store , and brought it home . It took me an hour to beat the game 100 % , and the graphics were awful . They were pointed all over , and looked worse than Lara Croft from Tomb Raider I. I would not reccomend buying this game enless you 're a first time gamer or under 8 years old . Rent , do n't buy if you 're older .	-1
I own a Compaq desktop , model 5686 , & amp ; a HP Pavillion laptop , model ze5170 . Both have Windows XP . I tried installing the game from 3 different CD Rom drives , 1 of which was my CD burner and the other a DVD/CD drive . None of them worked . The disk kept getting stuck on the Maps/Mission_10.wot file . I may have just gotten a dud , but I would n't try buying this game again unless I knew for sure that it worked on at least one computer that I own .	-1
I could not get far in this because of some bugs and problems . Not sure if its because it is an older type game but I just could not get into it to figure out how to get it to work . May work on Older Operating systems like Windows 98 or Windows XP with the Program Compatibility settings but Windows 7 and 8 Wont run it . As for game-play it was not on the high list of mine the little that I did get to work around and try . Just my personal tastes but FPS games are not that great to me .	-1
What I expected was another Total Annihilation , but obviously I was at err , I do n't know who made this game but if it was the original design team of TA then they were smoking somethin that made pretty colors dance across the screen . Ok , bottom line , TA kingdoms is by far the worst possible stradegy game ever ! It is SO slow on my P2 450mhz computer ( after I got about 50 units or so ) it was ridiculas ! I mean it was like watching your units walk through glue because the game slows down so bad , it took my little army of 30 units 15 minutes to reach the enemy base ! Also 3D acceleration for this game is non-existent ! In the original TA the computer cheated , but it was n't to an extream sence , here they made it ten-fold ! Whenever you are n't looking over the enemy 's base , they make units in 3 seconds or less , they can make thousands of units with only one lodestone in place ! its ridiculously IMPOSSIBLE in skirmish ( when you are just getting your defences finished they will have those plus a 30+ army coming to attack your base ) and just plain weird in campaign mode . Do not buy this game , buy the original TA , its WAY better , trust me . Avoid Kingdoms like it is a urine cup used to serve apple juice !	-1
I got this on sale and decided to have a look based on its low price and 5 star rating . What a joke ! It 's like Starcraft with bad graphics , zilch instructions and awful controls . There are better games out there that are free !	-1
While the curse began with `` Cartoon Studio '' for many Simpsons fans , it began with Virtual Springfield for me . Now , I 'll began by saying that this is one of the worst designed game ever . The developers attempted to use the `` Kids game '' excuse , but they even fail at that.Using myself as an example , I first got this game when I was seven years old . At this particular time in my life , I was EXTREMELY easy to please , but this game could n't even achieve that.The first and instantly noticeable problem with this game is that it is choppy and poorly programmed . I first played this game on a poor PC , but I later got a high end PC . I decided to give this game a second chance and I discovered something in the process . The game is choppy because it is poorly designed and programmed , not because my old PC was bad . If you were to look at the requirements , you could see that is is VERY low . The high end PC I had contained specs at least 5-10x higher than the requirements , yet the game was STILL choppy.And it 's not just some parts of the game , it 's EVERY part . When you turn , when you walk , when you do ANYTHING , you will notice the choppiness . That is , of course , assuming you have 20/20 vision or are wearing your glasses . Then again , you might notice it either way.The next and the second most noticeable problem is that the game has no substance . There are very few things you could do and the few things you could gets boring quickly . For example , the main thing you will be doing is simply exploring Springfield . This is all nice and good , but what happens when you explored everywhere ? Absolutely nothing . The game ends there . Of course , you could also collect cards , but it is so ridiculously easy that you can probably finish by the time you 're done exploring . Hell , at the time I first got this , I could n't solve ANY kind of puzzle , yet I did it anyway . In addition to this , the few minigames that are here are simply terrible . They were made to only take your attention for a minute or two . There are freeware online that are better than these minigames.Now , Virtual Springfield has already committed two of the the worst possible crimes for PC games ( bad programming and no gameplay ) , but to make the whole package even worse , it 's expensive . At the current time of this review , the lowest price offered for this game on Amazon is $ 10.99 . Selling a game THIS bad and that you could beat in less than one day for anything higher than $ 3 should be a federal offense punishable by 50 lashings.Overall , it is a terrible game that has once again proven that the old saying `` Do n't judge a book by its cover '' . I had thought that since this was a free roaming Simpsons game , it would rock the casbah , but I now realized my mistake . Do n't make the same mistake I did .	-1
all u do is walk around springfield and look at things , it is good at the start but then after u have looked at everything it [ stinks ] . there is nothing else to do.seriously , i am a HUGE fan of the simpsons but dont let the amazing tv show make you think that this game is good . its not . dont make the same mistake i did in buying it , you WILL be dissapointed .	-1
All you really do in this game is look around Springfield and run into the occasional character . I finished the entire thing in less than 2 hours . Plus it is not very vivid or deep . You can only visit 2 classrooms in the Springfield elementary school , there is only 1 angle of Moe 's bar etc . All you really do is LOOK at these locations that we are already familiar with and have the tiniest little bit of interaction with them . Plus the geography of Springfield in this game is not the same as the TV show . Which is also inconsistent in it 's placing of many `` sets '' . Moe 's Bar has been in many different places for example . But , then again , in the garbageman episode , the town was moved to another site . Perhaps this is where it got all shuffled up.There are a few little ( and I mean little ) games included . One of the main games is to simply find hidden baseball cards . A ploy to trick into clicking on the screen and revealing slight animation.In total there is just under 25 minutes worth of animation here and it is cool that the original cast provided the voices . But unless you are a die hard Simpsons fan then I would leave this game be . Definitely only for younger kids .	-1
I remember when I played the demo for this game . It was brilliant - you could stealth around , you had to be startegic and the atmosphere 10 times as tense as any other game ever . You had to loot a mansion and you could pick up some jewels for yourself as well . You had to AVOID making a comotion . The use of sound and light ( or lack of them ) was excellent as well . It was one of the best levels of any game I had ever played.I got my hands on the full version and rushed through the first level , eagar to see what theivery lay ahead . When I started playing the second level I found myself making my way through a haunted mine where I had to avoid zombies , kill spiders and eventually free someone from a prison . The whole thieving aspect had been taken away , and not only had degenerated into a standard cliched fantasy hack n slash affair , it was a BAD hack n slash affair . The next 2 or 3 levels were the same . Yes , you had to be stealthy , but not in the same context . I never played on - I had no motivation to.This could have been one of the best games ever , but in attempting to appeal to the mainstream ( lets face it , the thievery aspect would n't have sold well on consoles ) they messed it up , and they did n't even do the & quot ; it's-been-done-before & quot ; bit well . At least if it was done well it could have offered some short-term enjoyment ( albeit forgetable ) so that I would n't have completely wasted my money , but as it is it was a missed oportunity . Does n't even deserve the tag & quot ; Thief & quot ; most of the time .	-1
This game is more fun than having a bag of hammers dropped on your head , but not by much . A game where you rely on stealth and not your trigger finger is a good idea but I CA N'T SEE ANYTHING . I knew that I was in trouble on the very first mission . It went like this : Me : & quot ; Where am I ? Is this a wall or a door ? I 'll just open it- & quot ; Guard : & quot ; Hey ! & quot ; Me : & quot ; Oops ! & quot ; Guard kills me . The End.Wow . That was fun . Hoo-boy !	-1
This game is unexplicably fun , it drives you insane when your character dies , it makes you go into tears when you acquire your spells . THIS GAME IS EVIL ... First off you do one thing , kill , kill , and kill . Sure there are quests and of course tradeskills , but those two things are only possible by killing , and get boring and pointless . SO then you just end up killing everything , you keep going and going until it sucks your brain dry . DO N'T buy this game ...	-1
Ok , bottom line , this game starts out fun , and addictive , ok that said and done I wan na tell you how it really is . Everquest is just what it says , a quest that just keeps going and going , now I know this may sound fun at first , but keep reading . after playing my character to lvl 19 ( takes forever , 2 - 3 months ) I finally realised that the game is not changing , it never gets harder , its always the same , every enviroment is modeled after another , only changed a bit , the monsters are uninspired and it takes forever to get up lvls , as you can see above , ( for those of you who do n't know , a lvl is what you gain after getting enough experiance [ which is what you get when you kill a monster ] to surpase a limit which gains you a lvl and makes you better at fighting monsters . ) The monsters have terrible AI ( artificial inteligence ) they wander about the world until you or someone comes into view , then they attack you ! there is no AI in this game , a lvl 1 orc pawn will attack a lvl 20 warrior ! How stupid is that ? Does the pawn give any consideration to your supiriority ? No , it is simply programed to attack whatever comes into view . The only thing that gets harder about EQ as you go along is how long it takes to get lvls . It can take you as much as 6 months to a year before you get up to lvl 50 ( the highest lvl you can obtain ) . Another thing is the price , which ALL online RPG 's charge , you pay $ 40 - $ 50 to buy the game at the store , but it doesnt stop there , you have to pay 9.95 a month to continue playing . Now , if you have to pay $ 9.95 a month , why do they make you pay $ 50 to buy the game ? they should make it $ 20 to buy the game , and they should lower the price of the monthly cost as the game gets old , but they do n't , so you 'll end up paying a ridiculous price for everything and in the end , realise it was n't worth it . On the plus side , you get one month of play time free when you start to consider whether you want the game or not . Also the sound effects are pretty good .	-1
its made out to be a kung fu , meets super space intelligence meets d and d type stuff kinda vid.its just dark and not nearly exiting as all that.theres zero martial arts.the enemies are monsters not space age.its very hard to see what youre fighting.its extremely easy to beat.me and the ol lady took it out in a weekend .	-1
After all the years and all the hype I expected that this game would have *something* to recommend it . Sure , I realized it was n't going to be the GAME TO END ALL GAMES . I always make sure to discount 25 % for hype . But , my gods , what a poor showing this is ! There is next to no innovation . The graphics look like they were salvaged from Quake , the puzzles are of the annoying & quot ; find the panel that opens the door way the hell over there and backtrack , etc & quot ; style . The sense of immersion is zero . The sounds are poorly choosen . The enemies are , for the most part , utterly uninspired . The load times between segments ( which uses the Half-Life formula ) are ridiculously long . It 's also utterly unstable and prone to crashing at any given moment.Well , you get the point . If this were just another generic first person shooter that was being sold from $ 20 on the discount rack , maybe I would n't feel so annoyed . As it was , I went back and exchanged it for & quot ; Soldier of Fortune & quot ; which , well also not ground breaking , is solidly entertaining and , at least , mildly innovative.Please , folks , do n't get sucked in by the hype . Save your money for something better . In the meanwhile , I 'll be hoping that Ion Storms next big product , Deus Ex , does a better job of living up to its reputation .	-1
I decided to re-evaluate DAIKATANA and I found I very ambitious game with a lot of features and some crazy AI . Yes , this was a much over-hyped game when it was released and it did have a lot of bugs in it , but what PC games released nowadys do n't have any bugs that require a patch ? There is plenty of action in DAIKATANA and a variety a weapons . Some nice levels , but it all could have been better.Ok , the good things about DAIKATANA . If you can make it to the Greek levels and the Norway levels , you 'll be treated to some of the most stunning level designs ever in a game . The Greek levels in particular are quite stunning , almost beautiful . Plus the weapons in these levels are definately different from your standard FPS fare . In fact the Daikatana itself becomes the most powerful weapon in the game if you get it up in levels . DAIKATANA really tried to be different . There are a number of RPG elements in the game and this was a welcome change in the FPS realm . John Romero really had a great idea in mind for this game and I 'll give him credit there.Now the bad things about DAIKATANA . The much talked about sidekick AI . Yes , even I ran into this problem right away . There is a patch available that does make a difference . I suggest to download it after you install DAIKATANA . The first episode is just frustratingly bad . There is some truly garish level designs here as well in the final episode 4 in San Francisco . Also , I set this game on normal mode and it is SO HARD ! Even in Easy mode , I died almost immediatly in the beginning of the game ! This a bad thing in FPS games . The first few levels should be a cakewalk to build up your confidence to continue on . But not DAIKATANA . It is tough from the get go even on easy mode ! This game took 4 years to make and it was over-hyped.Even after the fact , this game should have been better . If you are curious enough to buy DAIKATANA , get the Prima games Strategy book . You 'll need it .	-1
& quot ; I am only left asking , & quot ; how long until Daikaitaina 2 ? & quot ; & quot ; - Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha ! I really tried to like this game.I felt like screaming & quot ; Turn the lights on ! & quot ; during the first level . What a murky morass . I installed this game twice and I still ca n't stand it.What angers alot of gamers is this : We wonder what games did n't get made because & quot ; Daikajokea & quot ; sucked up so much cash ?	-1
Daikatana is to computer games as Battlefield Earth is to movies . The plot is one-dimensional and does not let you stray , even to the point of letting your supposedly smart teammates ( read : more of a hindrance than a help ) , keep you back . If a man ca n't figure out how to walk in a straight line across a bridge , why should I trust him in a fight ? Additionally , the enemy AI is alternately idiotic or lethal , with little balance between which road is taken . The weapons range from the interesting to the downright Twinkish . The program itself drains a system of precious resources to accomplish what most other games can outdo with less programming , and with better results . This is a game to avoid . For a truly good game experience , stick to something with more plot , better game engine , and more developed player-to-AI interface.P.S . That One star should be 0 , thats right zero stars buddy .	-1
I am going to make this short but true . First off this game is HARD or at least what I played . this game is no Shoot them all like Quake 2 or anything . I found this game Repugent . I do n't even want to try it again . I do n't care if you have 1000 weapons , if you ca n't beat the first stage with Ease , then forget about the rest . The Graphics in this game are Dated back to the DOOM age . This 5 year opus did not pan out like I wanted . I really thought John Romero actually had some skill but it seems not . The game might have good points but the save system ( save only if you have a crystal ? ) is an abomination . This is a horrible idea which is seen way too much in Console System games , but never should have made it to the PC . I admit Ion Storm Made has made a killer game ( Deus Ex ) but this one is just a pile of turds . Bargin Bin Box . I also just want to close with this . We can now see the real genius behind Doom , and Doom 2 , was John Carmack , not John Romero . Sorry about being rude and mean , but this game is really horrible , and I just want to be honest .	-1
OK , this game was meant to be out 2 and a half years ago but what ever way you look at it , even if it had came out when it did it would still have struggled to be competitive back then.What the creators have tried to do is take a new approach by putting 4 games together in one through the different ages played by the lead character . All of them are as bad as one another . It plays like doom did and the AI is possibly the worst ever , in an age when AI is as good as Theif and SS2 . I think Pong had more intelligent coding then Daikatana . Unlike games where you injure someone and he runs to find his mate . Shoot a baddy in Daikatana and his mate will stand lifelifeless next to him watching the world go by.I was hugehly dissopointed as I thought this would be a rival to Half Life and would easily be the best first person shooter of the year ( to which Soldier Of Fortune holds the crown so far for me ) . This game rivals Doom but I think you 'll find Doom is 10 times better ! Still , it gets a star for the 4 ages idea and em ... a star for the logo and nice box ! I cant wait til Duke Nukem Forever , if its as bad as this I 'll cry !	-1
It 's technically competent , and indeed 'competent ' is a good word . It 's just very , very uninspiring , and after a seemingly endless and tortuous wait ( the release was held back for three years , during which time many of the creators left the company ) , it 's a disappointment . Not a huge one , as people were beginning to suspect that it might not be very good . Whilst 'Half-Life ' had the advantage of suddenly appearing from nowhere , Daikatana 's gestation was extremely public , despite the 'it 'll be ready when it 's ready ' attitude . What 's it like , though ? Dull . That 's what . Whilst by no means as lacklustre as 'Blood 2 ' , it 's infected with an air of carelessness . The graphics and sound are functional , the gameplay is no more advanced or entertaining than 'Quake 2 ' , the character AI and voice acting are both simplistic and irritating ( your sidekicks are infuriatingly stupid , and their death instantly loses you the game ) and , crucially , both 'Half-Life ' and 'Soldier of Fortune ' are much , much better , and cheaper .	-1
Dont ever , ever buy this game ! I knew it was going to be bad . So far this game beat the record for the shortest stay in my hard drive , even beating Trespasser by 2 days . A game that took 4 years to develop , well , you know something 's not right . Lets start with the graphics . Really very dated OpenGL graphics . If this game came out 2 years ago , it would 've been awesome . Interface : No In-Game save . Only way to say your progress is by picking up Save Gems . No Gems , no save . Control : Ok , so it 's like any other first person shooter which is why I gave this game it 's one and only star . AI : very very bad . Talk about having your AI teammates to back you up . You 'll be saving them most of the time instead of them helping you . Also , there is a tendency that your artifical teammates to hit you by mistake . Story : just watch the old TV series & quot ; Time Tunnel & quot ; . Overall : spend your money on another game .	-1
Come now , who here really thinks they put some time into designing this game ? The game 's story is as horrible as it is clich & eacute ; and is being voice acted by people that sound too much like a student film class working on a mid-term project.Combat consistis of clicking your mouse button in timed bursts or uning an asinine keybord interface to swing your weapon in three different strengths . Whee.Magic spell creation is novel , but quickly become tedious and dangerous in the middle of combat when you 're trying like a madman ( or madwoman ) to heal yourself , but ca n't get the runes lined-up in time.And even the graphics , which are nice , are loaded with bugs . In most cases , whenever an enemy would drop an item , the background would spring 'holes ' of black space around it and cause nemerous graphic flaws until it would finally crash without explination . Furthermore , some enemies would become 'stuck ' in some void on your screen preventing you from being able to attack it ! Overall , a terrible clone attempt at Diablo that should make Eidos ashamed ... and let 's not even bring up Dikatana , okay ?	-1
cool concept and neat setting are n't enough to make this worth a purchase . it was rushed out the door like no ones business and thus suffers from astounding slow down at time making the game unplayable , and thus broken . this game was so rushed they did n't even have time to put music , ANY music , in the game at all . this would have been a must have for dreamcast if it was given proper time but deadlines cut the guts out of this one .	-1
It 's sad . I always liked the Might and Magic ( MM ) series . It was fairly simple but the built-in journaling and mapping tools made it less of a pain than other RPGs . Unfortunately MM seems to be frozen in time and this version does n't appear to have any changes from previous one . There is a new storyline , or more precisely , a new variation of a Might and Magic storyline but graphics , sound , monsters , spells , skills and interface at all the same . I could n't get the game run with DirectX under Windows 2000 , software mode only , although the game is listed as NT-compatible . Keyboard shortcuts would stop working and occasional clipping problems got me stuck and forced a reload to get out . The sound is what really drove me crazy . The character voices can be cut off but not the NPCs . I 'll have 'Have a pleasant evening ! '' ringing in my head for years.For die-hard Might and Magic fanboys only .	-1
I 'm a huge fan of the TR series , and I like the movies as well . TR1 and TR2 were the best in terms of story , pacing and action . The CG sequences were cooler too . I hate to say it , but I 'm disappointed in this game . TOO SLOW ! The levels go on forever , and there 's nothing to keep your interest . Ocassionally you will have a ninja jump out at you , or some scorpians , but that 's not enough to keep you interested.The other problems is the levels require too much backtracking and are too complicated . I got stuck numerously and ending up getting a code off the internet to skip levels . The beginning of the game shows promise with young Lara , and there is a very cool level where Lara has to manuver a jeep in the desert and over cliffs and whatnot.I do n't know what I can recommend instead of this one , but I would say rent it or get it for cheap like $ 5 or less used or new . She tomb raids for too long with little payoff .	-1
I , like most who have played this game , am a huge fan of the Tomb Raider series . I especially enjoy the puzzle solving of the first game and the action/adventure element and increased pace of the second one . This series starts off promisingly enough . Outside of a mandatory ( groan ) training level , the game eases you into the tried-and-true Tomb Raider gameplay we all have grown to love . The environments are large and exciting , the puzzles clever . Exploration is fun and rewarding , and progress is logical . For the first 6 or 7 hours . The challenge level really picks up after the VERY neat train level , and in fact starts to become downright maddening . Do we really have to backtrack for 3 hours just to find 7 scattered items required to make it through to the next level ? Things get flat-out obnoxious at the Chambers Of Tulun and the Trenches . This area goes something like this : rope swing to hit a switch that unlocks an invincible guy in a room . Go to the Citadel Gate level to obtain a nitrous oxide canister . Return to the Chambers and go to the Trenches . Obtain the nitrous oxide feeder . Return to the Chambers of Tulun to obtain the roof key . Go back to the Trenches to get to the Street Bazaar . Get the car jack and mine detonator so you can get back to the Trenches . And so on and so on and so on . Is this mad jumble of item dispersion that is being passed for level design really necessary ? I really enjoy the high challenge level of the Tomb Raider series , but this is ridiculous . If I did n't have a strategy guide with me , I would n't have made it to the Citadel ( which is where I am right now ) . This game is loads of fun for about 20 or 25 levels ; afterwards , it becomes a chore to play . The graphics and presentation have not been improved drastically since the first Tomb Raider , and the legendary level design has regressed considerably . Many spots feel cheap , rather than challenging . Control , while still functional , still is n't perfect , and it causes every jump to be deliberate and nerve-wracking . If you miss and survive , then you have to make another series of jumps , which can take another 10 minutes just to get back to where you originally were . I could go on and on , but this game is just too much . Get this only if you 're a die-hard TR fan ; but be prepared to fork out some extra cash for a strategy guide .	-1
I have little patience when it comes to games like this . Makes me wish I had n't bought it and I am still trying to get rid of it . Before buying take mine I will mail it to you before I hurl it through the wall . EGM said this was a good game and usually they are right . Well they blew it this time . Do n't get me wrong it might be fun . Good concept , interesting story , Terribly frustrating gameplay and absolutely ridiculous boss fights . I never knew the playstation load time to be this irritating until I died 50 times in a row . O ' YE OF LITTLE PATIENCE AVOID THIS ONE !	-1
I am totally at a loss for this game . On one hand it has so many original idea 's in terms of both plot and gameplay ( And has the closest thing to a sim dating game we 'll probably ever see ) , but the way you actually play it leaves me at a loss for words . It 's not that the battle system makes no sense , or is bad even , it 's the leveling up that confuses me . You do n't get stronger when you level up . Your defense gets weaker when you level up . You get more health but you seem to loose more health at the same token too . I 'm am at a loss that the creaters of this game could make so many good idea 's and make them so poor because they ca n't figure out commen sense when it comes to leveling up.If you want an RPG that 's original get this ... just do n't exspect to get anywhere with it .	-1
the game its self was good but the ending was such a letdown i had fun playing it making the girls mad but the ending was just so bad that it killed the whole game for me i played 40 hours into it	-1
Never before in my gaming experience have I been turned off from a game in the first minute of game play.The biggest pro in this game is the fact that you can fart and burp and that , my friends , is a sad , sad thing indeed.The programmers could have saved the gaming community the misery and not released this albatross at all . Heck , I probably would have paid them the 5 bucks I bought it for not to put it on the market and it would have been a win-win for everyone.I love GTA . It 's a great game , but why does the '88 NES Super Mario Bros. have superior graphics to a PS1 game from 1999 . It defies rational explanation and this game defies all rationality itself.I am ashamed to call this a GTA game or even a product from Rockstar .	-1
Well I bought this mainly cause I always liked the soundtrack from it and I thought it was cool that U could just slap it right into a cd player and listen to it . Like tomb raider 1 , Loaded , etc Well with the greatest hits version , that 's not possible . Not only is that not possible but it has a totally different soundtrack on it . I used PSXMC to listen to it . so never really liked the game because of the 2d style gameplay , definitely do n't like it now since they change the soundtrack and stuff on it . Greatest Hits disk SUXS ! ! it did come with all the manuals , case , etc .	-1
This game looks like it was made in 5 minutes . It has horrible graphics , and barley any improvments from the first Grand Theft Auto . If you like this type of free-for-all shootem up , pick up the amazing GTA 3 , ( my all-time favorite ) for the PS2 .	-1
Given that I have upset many people with my controversial view of this ( cough ) classic I decided to give it a second chance.Let 's see let 's put it through the test.Graphics : 1 out of 5 ( it fits on the Gameboy Color , that 's pathetic for a PSX ) Sound : 1 out of 5 ( fairly decent sound effects , bad music ) Controls : 1 out of 5 ( these are the worst controls ever ) Fun Factor : 1 out of 5 ( I still returned it the next day ) So there you have it . This is a very bad game and I would rather have my tounge frozen to a pole with rabid poodles knawing at my ankles than play this again . Word of advice , buy a PS2 and get Grand Theft Auto 3 , you will not regret that financial investment .	-1
Do not buy this game . Seriously . People might try to tell you it all great and dandy , but as a very heavy gamer , I think I can honestly rate it as one of the worst games I have ever played.The graphics were terrible , even for playstation , the difficulty was ridiculous and through the roof , your teammates were slow and stupid and the enemies all shot far more accurately then you could.The difficulty was even backward , from everything I have read on the game- easy was hard and hard was easy . It was like the game was n't even finished.Now the game might not be that bad if it just let you relax and stealth through a mission . But , no , every map has an absurdly short timer , forcing you to run headlong from start to finish , shooting wildly at everything around you , trying to get to the end before your team gets slaughtered or the time runs out.I only ever managed to beat the first mission once- and im pretty good at shooter games- but the second mission was only that much worse.I have a rule , that I keep every game I own ( rather then trading it in ) forever and ever because you never know when one day you might want to go back and play it again . This is probably the only game I 've ever owned that broke that rule . When I think of what the worst game I ever played was , this is usually what comes to mind.The sound was terrible , the graphics were terrible , the controls were terrible , the difficulty was terrible , the TIMER was terrible , what little I seen of the AI was not impressive- teammates killing themselves like always- and even the lighting was terrible , forcing you to stare at this strange vista of green and black all the time.You want a playstation one stealth shooter ? Try Metal Gear Solid , or syphon filter , or anything . Anything at all.Please , I 'm warning you , do n't buy this game . Not even for 1 dollar , because it will only tempt you into the torture of playing it . You will get far more pleasure out a dollar double cheeseburger anyhow .	-1
I do n't want to diss anyone who likes this game , but I ca n't really see much good in this game . The graphics are not really anything speical . It seems almost impossible to see the enemy and you find your self being shot and you ca n't see the enemy until you 've had a major loss of life . The control is rather overly complicated and is n't exactly user freindly . The sound is okay , but it seems to make you a little tence . The game is near impossible even on easy difficultys . I have owned the game for quite a long time and still have n't beaten the first level by myself . The missons seem a bit vague and you think & quot ; okay ... what the heck do I do now ? & quot ; too often . When I play this , I ca n't help but get frustrated and it always feels like the game 's fault ... .. Even if you are in to army stuff , you might want to rent this first . If this is your kind of thing , I recomend Medal of Honor : Underground or Syphon Filter .	-1
I love war type games , and when my brother bought this , I thought it was going to be great . I guess I was expecting a bit much , maybe a lot much . The game 's graphics are putrid . awful sounds , and [ weak ] gameplay . No good plots either . Enemies have the strangest ability of shooting through trees and small hills at you , but you ca n't shoot them . It took two days to finish it . It was the worst I have played.The upside - . . .Wait , what upside ? The downside - About everything . If you are thinking of buying the game , do yourself a favor and rent it first . You might just kick yourself about it later .	-1
I played this game years ago , but I never got to where I am right now ! I 'm at the part where you should float on top of the pipes to get to Zephon 's Lair , and one thing is that there is almost no way to get past that part ; if you 're lucky , you will make it the first time , if not , you will be trying over 500 times , nothing ! This game can also be frustrating as in difficulty , you can get lost very easily ! I just do not recommend this game , unless you love to deal with bugs ! Avoid at all costs !	-1
Looking for rise off of naked blue men with green capes reminding you of your hero to save you . Well this game is for you . I first got introduced by one of my friends I mean an acquaintance . His favorite games soon showed me that he really was n't all that bright . He said ( In a gay womenly voice ) `` Hey try this game out . '' So I said hey what the hell . As I took it home I hid it away so no one would see it . So I popped it into my Playstation and even it rejected it . So after a couple of trys it finally ran . So the title screen appeared ... I never knew this was an alien/vampire porno flick . The idea of impailing naked green `` Slaughs '' as their called in the game is n't my idea of a thrill . After killing them their balls shoot out numbing the mind into thinking why the main character would have to eat them to gain energy . Wow now I know im scared . Then the mysteriousnes of tredding through the two mystical worlds ( one retarted ... another more retarted ) is as amazing as tredding through a piece of sh*t. Answer me this : If a vampire/gay alien , has his mouth ripped off how can he eat balls or talk ? Its amazing ! ! `` Feed on the balls of your enemies '' `` Explore the vast pieces of crap and an extra bonus its a ball buffet ! ! '' The main character is not only a gay alien but is supposedly a vampire . His arch enemy is another vampire but is about ... I do n't know a billion times better then him ( Just a rough estimate ) . The most amazing complex part of the gameplay is his amazing three hit combo . WOW THREE HITS ! ! Then press x to dodge/lunge and triangle to impale . Oh the complexity . My mind strains over this sh*t. Well if you like to get off to blue alien like men ... Go for but I suggest you do n't waist your money .	-1
Take a game made by someone else , change it , use the Tomb Raider engine , add some nonsense and you have the so-called LOK series.The only game in this series worth mentioning and playing is Blood Omen , the rest of these are Tomb Raider Engine based made by someone else ( not Silicon Knights the Creators ) .	-1
I really wanted to like this game . I wanted to play it ever since I got my Dreamcast . After many delays , it finally came out , so I rented it . Thank God I did . I 'm sorry to report , but this is a horrible game . But why ? Here 's why : 1 . The Graphics . While they 're certainly not the worst I 've ever seen , they really leave too much to be desired , especially for the fact that this is a Dreamcast game . You can see the polygons sticking out of the characters and they do n't look real at all . I 've seen N64 games that look better than this . Heck , I 've seen Playstation games that look better . 2 . The Controls . They are the worst part of this game . Using the X , Y , B , and A buttons to move is n't bad , but on default , A moves foward and Y moves back . But that 's not all . With almost unuseable menus and 37 commands put into the Dreamcast controller , it makes the game a REAL pain to learn and makes it barely playable . I can assure you , the controls are much worse than they sound . Plus , the loading times are too darn long . But there 's a good part to the game . The sounds are very good and draw you into the action . But that 's it . I was hoping for a good spy game like Goldeneye , but on Dreamcast , but I just was n't that lucky . Do n't bother wasting your time with this piece of junk . Instead , skip it and go immediately to Perfect Dark . Trust me , you 'll be glad you did .	-1
The absolute worst Dreamcast game I have ever played . I would not even take this game if it was given to me for free .	-1
In Rainbow Six , you assemble a highly skilled team of anti terrorist commandos , plan out your assault and then control one or more of the team as you commence your invasion.The critical item to note here is that the majority of the game is spent choosing your team , equiping them properly and then planning out the raid . This is not Syphon Filter where you jump into a room of bad guys and blaze away . You can be killed in a single shot . Once the action begins , you can play any one of the raid team that is engaging the enemy , otherwise the sophisticated computer AI will guide them according to your plans.I agree with the reviews that suggest that you rent this game first . It is very detailed and realistic . If you do n't want to spend hours analyzing and preparing the missions , then you wont't appreciate the game 's considerable depth.I find that the detail level does not lend itself well to the standard dreamcast controller . There are too many things to do and the interface layout is awkward without a keyboard and mouse . I also found that the action part of the game ( moving the aiming cursor ) was overly sensitive and very frustrating to use.The other reason that this game does not rate highly for me was the poor , boxey graphics and the medicore sound . They just do not take advantage of the Dreamcast capabilities . On the otherhand , the game does have a lot of replay value and very sophisticated AI .	-1
I bought this game because I had lost my original and I wanted to play it again . The day I got it I played it for 3 Hours ! I had so much fun . Then the next day I wanted to play with it again . But when I went to play it , My data did not save and I thought it was maybe because I played it on the Gamecube . So I took out my gameboy color and played it again . I played and then saved . I turned it back on within 5 minutes and it said my data saved so I thought my problem was done . But then I turned it back on within 8 hours and everything again was deleted . I tried to play it on my Gameboy Advance SP and it did the exact same thing as the Gameboy Color . I just contacted the Buyer to see if I could get a refund or my money Back . I am pissed that it did n't work and I wasted my money on it . But I am sad too because I love this game and I wanted to play it . Make sure your game saves before you play it for 3 hours : ( UPDATE : I did receive a refund for the game back on my Card . I paid shipping and Handling to send it back .	-1
I had this game a while ago . I loved it almost as much as I loved the SNES version . I liked being able to play a girl , and to get a cat , and I also liked that this was back when you could decently play the game and turn a good in-game profit WITHOUT the optional help of the sprites ( all other HM recently , I 've noticed you NEED them ... I 'd rather do the farming myself than pay a stupid lil sprite to do it ) ... but I was sorely disappointed that the marriage system is completely missing from this game.And thats not the worst of it ... This is a 'real time ' game , and after a while , either it decides you 're not playing enough , or the time system just breaks ... either way , unless you play it almost nonstop , it will start killing your plants and your livestock will mysteriously hate you.Its good fun while it lasts ... but it does n't last long enough to even win it .	-1
I thought the game was dull . It was n't even scary ! The storyline was weak and really did n't have a point to it . The playing screen was also small but the graphics were good . It needs more excitement and adventure . Overall , I was disapointed .	-1
I really ca n't believe that this game has received four stars from Amazon reviewers.I had high expectations of this game because of the many positive reviews and the cheap price . The expectations where totally deflated when I realized how small the actually screen display was while playing the game . I 've never had to deal with such an annoying small display ever in my PC gaming experience . Along with the poor dialogue and story , the opening was even worse . Every time you restart the game after quitting , you are taken to the beginning screen , when you should be taken to the load/save option . I admit this is a small detail to dislike , but none the less , it is unacceptable for an adventure game.Some puzzles were very difficult to solve . I had to replay the 1940 's scene many times just to get my idiotic character to say one particular line just so I could move the radio dial to enter a room , which would enable me to finally finish the scenario in one minute.The somewhat creepy sounds and music , and the fact that it deals with the paranormal are the only reasons why I rate this game with two stars ...	-1
After the hated Mortal Kombat Annihilation which I can have fun with it 's a guilty pleasure & it follows The Mortal Kombat 3 storyline to a small extent they changed too much made characters like Jade in name only & added fan fiction . Now movies based on video games about all of them just suc k. Ok a movie wo n't hurt the games but you had other stuff going on like the cartoon on USA network Defenders Of The Relm that does n't hold it 's not even a guilty pleasure . I remember they had Conquest which that was garbage I ca n't even remember it . What about the games well Mortal Kombat 4 did good in the arcades & was released on N 64 PS1 in summer 98 it really did n't do the business that Midway or The Mortal Kombat Team wanted . John Tobias who was the writer for The Mortal Kombat games around 1997 wanted to do these character driven adventure games which means prequels which I 'm sorry I do n't like prequels . I did n't like these adventure games I have n't ever played Monks or whatever although I 've heard good things about it . In 1997 Mortal Kombat Mytholgies was released & it 's a giant clunker bad controlls could n't make your jumps you could n't pull off your moves just an extremely bad game . Mortal Kombat Special Forces was released in 2000 . John Tobias was n't happy where the franchise was going I guess Ed Boon wanted Mortal Kombat to get with the times . John Tobias wanted to make his adventure games he left right in the middle of production of this game . John Tobias took part of the MK Team with him . Ed Boon went ahead rushed it got John Vogel to write the rest & what we got was a terrible train wreck mess of game . It deals with Jax & Sonya who are after Kano . I 'm going off of memory when I played this game like 8 or 9 years ago . You play as Jax & well you get terrible controlls you ca n't turn around when your getting attacked from behind so you get pwnd . I remember you had solve password to get in buildings & I could never get them to work that 's all I remember oh & my as s got burned to he ll by a boss . I did n't complete this game it was that awful . That 's what all I can remember if anybody out there want 's to send me this game as gift that 's fine I can give a better review but I would n't play it right away . But Mortal Kombat gets back on track when evil comes in 2 .	-1
I love Mortal Kombat . I really do . I have always been a huge fan of the franchise , but I am very sorry to say , the MK `` adventure '' games sucked . Is there anything good to say about THIS game ? ? ? No . Nothing at all , of course . It 's just as bad as MK Mythologies and MK Shaolin Monks . ... maybe even a little worse than those two . The gameplay is absolutley awful . It is unplayable ! The controls will make you wan na throw the controller through your TV screen . It 's almost impossible to control Jax , let alone fight . The storyline is about how Jax and Sonya have to go after Kano , or some kind of bullcrap like that . The graphics are eye-aching . Just terrible . Bad gameplay , bad controls , bad story , bad graphics=very very bad game ! The konquest modes in MK Deception and MK Armageddon were more fun and better than this !	-1
Oh wow ... .I remember playing this colossal flaming pile of turd . A friend of mine rented this game from Blockbuster for a couple of days . And I wished we both could have taken back the time we wasted.They had great ideas for this game : You take Sub Zero from the Mortal Kombat series , use this opportunity to tell people more about his back story and his battle against monks , set it in cool locales and incorporate MK inspired game play and controls in an action adventure , side scroller with light RPG influences . What could possibly go wrong ? ? ? How about ... .EVERYTHING in this game.First off , Sub Zero walks and controls like a robot . Second , this game uses every button on the controller ( you even have a separate button to hit when you want him to face the direction to walk ! ) Third , you unlock his special moves as you progress through the game and while many use the same directional pad + button combinations in Mortal Kombat , they are 100 times harder to pull off . The bosses are petty damn hard so expect to die a lot . The graphics and sound do their job in setting the mood for the game , while the music is standard MK and kung fu inspired theatrical sounding . The PS1 version features full motion cut-scenes between the stages you fight in while the N64 gets the standard static artwork.I give it two stars for the cool music and graphics for its time . But that alone will not make a great game . You may be tempted to pick this up if you love Mortal Kombat and the price is right . DON '' T DO IT ! ! This is an example of how Midway had great ideas for this game but executed these great ideas very poorly .	-1
I admit I did put hours into this game being the hugh Mortal Kombat fan that I am . Gosh I 'm sure happy this embarrassing MK game did n't ruin Subzero 's career . It is a side scroller in which you are faced with many evil monks ( oh , and they 're all twins for some reason ) ..Subzero has many power-ups that prove useless . The mega-sized bosses are boring to fight ( oh , and they never die for some reason ) . Due to the fact that the game supplies no level maps ( how generic ) a strategy guide would be a must , that is if you cared to bother with the game in the first place . Two good things did come about from this MK disaster.. Quan Chi & Shinnok . For Mortal Kombat that is a must see `` MK4 '' or the new `` MK Deadly Alliance '' . Leave this one in the past where it never should have spawned . 2 1/2 stars is as high as I could go . I 'm generous .	-1
For those of you who do n't know , you play the game as one of three towering monsters , a werewolf , giant lizard or giant ape and the point is to destroy cities across the world . Sure the original arcade game is a classic , with lots of punching and smashing to offer , however this game `` world tour '' does not have much to offer in terms of fun . Its fun for about the first five or ten minutes , beating , smashing , punching and kicking , then the reality sets in that this is a tedious game . There are over 100 cities and each city is not just a screen , it 's a side scrolling level ! It would n't be so bad if the enemies were not horrendous ! Its not just ten enemies on a screen at once , its about thirty to fifty at some points , shooting , bombing , flame throwing , flying and stomping you . The entire game despite being 100 cities can be defeated in a single day but does have a save feature with the memory packs . There is a nice plus though , lots of moves to learn and master , lots of detail , each city looks unique and features landmarks of that city and it is very educational for children to learn geographical locations . Do n't pay more than ten bucks for this game though .	-1
I 'm ordering this game on super NES on Ebay . It 's only $ 3 . I heard it was good so I want it . I 'm also buying Ultimate MK3 and MK Annihilation . It 's only $ 5 all together . I 'm SO MAD that Baraka is n't in it . At least Kung Lao is in it . I like his friendship where he throws his hat like a frisbee . Nightwolf 's friendship is cool too where he juggles his hammers . I like Sindel 's animality . I am SO buying this game .	-1
I purchased this awful gameboy game 15 years hoping it would be as good as it 's predecessor-but no such luck ! MK3 does'nt have a link cable option ( like it 's 2 predecessors before ) nor does it have any SGB enhancements ( border , color , sound ) .Though it incorporates the same digitize graphics and sound as Gameboy 's THQ 's Super Return Of The Jedi-which 2 sucked.Nevertheless , pick up MK2 instead .	-1
To start off this review , let me tell you that I bought Mortal Kombat 4 for the Game Boy before 3 . It had lousy AI , good graphics , bland music , semi-unresponsive controls , and 3 difficulty modes : Novice , Warrior , and Master . But , it was good enough to get 3 stars.What I found to be strange was that Mortal Kombat 3 on the Game Boy had several similarities to 4 . The only differences are : Different characters and setting , badder music , and the controls a bit more unresponsive . Everything else seems to be the same . It 's not like it 's a direct sequel , is it ? I mean , the MegaMan series always had the same gameplay sequel after sequel . But I do n't recall Mortal Kombat series having the almost exact same things.The graphics are good . The characters are digitized , like how they were in the previous games.The gameplay , however , can be unresponsive.Like all other Game Boy Mortal Kombats , this game would be short . You only get to fight 9 characters in Master mode , 7 in Warrior , and 5 in Novice.The best attack to use is just kicking . That 's kinda sad . Usually , the uppercut would be the best standard attack to use , but no . Instead , it 's KICKING.However , even after all this , it would manage to have some appeal.Overall , it 's alright , but if you want a great Mortal Kombat game for the Game Boy , buy MK2 instead .	-1
First of all ... let me say , that I am a HUGE MK fan , but oh my god ... this game sucks ! This is a TERRIBLE version of MK3.The fighters move VERY slowly and it is SOOOO HARD to pull off a single special move ... let alone a fatality ! ! ! The sound is terrible , the music is all muffled.Although the graphics are decent , this game is a komplete letdown.If you want a great MK game for the Game Boy , pass this piece of krap up and buy Mortal Kombat II instead.It 's A WHOLE LOT BETTER ! ! !	-1
Wow this sucks pretty bad , i liked mk2 on gameboy and thought if anything this would be an impove ment . I was wrong ... everything moves god awful slow and moves are so easy to do . I thought nintendo would have not edited this game ( unlike the first 2 mk games ) and put some blood in , it even had an M rating , but once again i was wrong . No blood no guts , is n't that what set MK apart form most fighting games ? ? The graphics aint bad and neither is the music , but the gameplay ruins all that in a heart beat . dont't even bother. , ... ..	-1
I do n't know where to begin . This is , like , the worst game I have ever played in my life . The graphics suck , the gameplay reeks , the sound is pathetic , and on top of it all , the characters are given no respect whatsoever as they are designed badly and their moves do n't work the way I , them , or anyone would want them to . If you like Mortal Kombat ( like I do ) stick to games like Deadly Alliance and Deception . I mean , Mortal Kombat Advance was crummy , but it was three times better than this piece of trash . You want the true MK games . DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON AN INSULT TO THE SERIES SUCH AS THIS ! !	-1
Mortal Kombat 4 is the first 3D game of the series . Despite that , the Game Boy version is still 2D.The graphics are good . The characters are digitized , like how they were in the previous games.The gameplay , however , can be unresponsive.Like all other Game Boy Mortal Kombats , this game would be short . You only get to fight 9 characters in Master mode , 7 in Warrior , and 5 in Novice.The best attack to use is just kicking . That 's kinda sad . Usually , the uppercut would be the best standard attack to use , but no . Instead , it 's KICKING.The enemy AI is way too easy to beat . I got through Master mode without any trouble . Granted , they can attack almost decently , but just throw 5 kicks and then it 's possible he/she 'd die . It can be glitchy when it comes to fighting Scorpion and Shinnok . You can still attack them even while they use their `` Get over here '' attacks on you . It does n't look like you are , but then you see the enemy 's HP draining . If you attack them by just mashing A repeatedly , and kill them , you somehow use your fatality.For some reason , I just manage to get addicted to this game . I do n't know how , but I just ended up like that.There are a couple special stuff in the game when played on the Super Game Boy : -Special and cool-looking 16-Bit border-Colors change every screen to appropriate colorsWhen played on the Game Boy Color , the colors make very detailed backgrounds.Overall , buy MK2 instead .	-1
This is a TERRIBLE version of Mortal Kombat 4 ! The graphics are awful , the sound and music is ear aching , and the gameplay is beyond hideous.This plays just like MK3 did on the gameboy ... like total krap ! Actually , it may even be worse than MK3 ! Avoid this at all costs !	-1
Just give up , this game is so bad i dont how it got a seal of quality . Its MK3 remade . choppy terrible graphics , horrible sound , moves , and everything else . I ca n't even tell which character im choosing ! ! You can tell they put noo effort into this game at all . If you want a fighting game try street fighter alpha on Gbc , and stay far away from this ! ! !	-1
Okay is this a April fools joke this game is terrible mortal kombat in 3D what were they thinking this game is bad really bad mk4 in 3D that just puts the other ones to shame . so midway check your mk games before bringing them out because this game just sucks do n't even buy it i do n't recommend it to any mk fan the controls are terrible so i could go on but theres so much wrong with this game that 's why i gave it 1 stars	-1
Mortal Kombat Trilogy was a popular game back in the early days of the Playstation 's existence . Even before the Playstation Mortal Kombat was known as a groundbreaking game for its graphic violence on the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis . It was the first of its kind , or one of the first . Looking back at the old 2D fighter games , despite the heavy amount of blood and all the creative fatalities , Mortal Kombat STINKS , plain and simple . The game tries to look dangerous and back in the day it really WAS a threat . Parents were terrified that their children might experience all the blood and gore.We 're talking nearly 14 years since the original Mortal Kombats release , and now we can look at the Mortal Kombat series for what it really is : a cheesy-looking and crappy series of uninteresting tournament fighting . That 's what the entire series is ( until the game turned 3D , then I do n't know WHAT to think ) . Just the way the two fighters attack each other is SO boring . Even the best fighters like Sub-Zero and Noob Saibot are a total bore.Midway thought they really had something going when they created Mortal Kombat Trilogy . It featured nearly EVERYBODY from the previous Mortal Kombat games . How can it be bad ? Well , besides the reasons I mention above , the Playstation version is murdered with INCREDIBLE amounts of loading times . People can say the Playstation was a bad system when it came to loading all they want , but the fact remains Mortal Kombat Trilogy is quite possibly the most annoying game when it comes to waiting to play the freaking thing . Sometimes you have to wait almost a minute before the game *finally* loads the fight screen . And the fighting is so bad ( because the entire Mortal Kombat series up until this point is severely dated and horrible ) that the loading times are actually the part I look forward to the most.I 'll give the game one extra point for featuring all the fighters in one nifty little package . Besides that . BAD game .	-1
This game is not the version I remember . It feels very clunky and the load times are hardly tolerable . Try another version for your MK3 fix .	-1
I do n't know how people are rating this game so highly . I am a huge MK fan , but this game defines why I try to forget that MK3 and UMK3 came into existence . This is an absolutely horribly programmed one player game . The computer controlled players anticipate and counter every single move you do even on very easy ! You have to pick Motaro just to make it to the end , and then who had the brilliant idea of giving Shao Kahn a throw-there goes the one way you could beat him with most players . Avalance software must have spent one day configuring the AI for this stinker . Then , to make matters worse , the Playstation D-pad controls like a tuna boat in a boat race . Good luck not breaking your controller as you watch your character get decimated and wonder why the move you tapped in did not work , over and over again . Then after I finally beat the game with Scorpion , the machine crashed twice so who knows if he has an ending or not.The only reason I gave it two stars , is that with two people you do get an almost arcade perfect MK experience , but you still deal with the absolutely ridiculous characters of MK3 and UMK3 and all its palette swaps . My advice is to turn off aggressor mode as well as all of those cheap auto combos and pretend you are playing MKII with some extra backgrounds .	-1
I first bought this game in a Hastings book store a long time ago and I 've been a Mk fan for quit some time , so I went ahead and bought it thinking `` This is great ! I 've got MK trilogy that has all of my favorite characters in it . And Midway makes really great games . ( LOL ) And I managed to find it in a five dollar bin . This is truly a lucky day for me . `` Until I played it ... .Then as time went on , I kept it in my basement , and then one day I decided to bring it out because I had n't played it in a while and I forgotten all of the moves . So I went to the options menu and put it on a pansy level so I can get the feel for it again . Then I remembered why I put it the basement . What I should have done was bury it in the back yard , never to see the light of day again.As soon as the first round said `` FIGHT '' I might as well thrown in the towel . The game was gracious enough thou to just stand there for two seconds and let me get one shot in even thou I was 99.9 % dead anyway , I mean , what the F is the point ? ! I do n't even think the skill level even works.The only way to make it up the ladder without facing brutalities and stage fatalities is if you were to play as Kintaro , ( he 's your best bet . ) If you play as Motaro you will get your a** handed to you literally ! ( Pun intended ) . The A.I . actually puts any character to uppercut him and send him flying almost out of view of the screen ! But if you were to uppercut the A.I . Motaro , he only staggers , ca n't have him flying into the air , oh no , that would require fairness in the game.MK has been known for the ( copy and paste ) routine on characters , and MK Trilogy is the crowning achievement of it . The male and female ninjas , and if a guy has a bike helmet and armor pads that they bought down over at Wal-Mart and calling them cyborg ninjas , you know this is a cheap a** game . What the hell was this game made off of , a 50 $ budget ? I guess Wal-Mart was selling helmets and bike armor pads on a half off sale.If the Matrix was to take a glitchy $ H & % , I 'm sure that it would look something like this . I can actually hear my PS one groaning as it loads the next game , and that happens every minute . If that PS could talk it 'd say ; `` Oh god , please get this F-ing virus out of me ! '' Hell I think that a virus would actually improve this game , sense there 's little it could do to F-up an already broken a** game.I can see now why it was in five dollar bin , but I remember that there was a trash bin next to it , and if I knew then before I bought it , I would have said ; `` Hey , this is in the wrong bin . `` Its hard to take this gory game seriously if that douche bag Dan Fordan 's big fat head keeps popping out saying `` Toasty . '' I would n't be a damn bit surprised if I saw Charley Sheen pop-out of the corner and say ; `` Already got your money dude . `` And when it says on the back of the game . `` Seven humiliating stage fatalities that sends your opponent plummeting to there embarrassing death . '' That 's you , your the opponent . The A.I . will make sure of that.As for brutalities , who the hell takes the time to flush there life away to memorize twelve different moves just to do one lousy move so a guy explodes ? Wow . I never seen five skulls and twenty femur bones pop out of a guy a before . Apparently Ed or one of the designers of this pile of $ * # & game , does n't know a damn thing about the human anatomy . Its bad enough that you have to remember all the fatalities and trademark moves , now this ? To sum it up.The game play was awful.The A.I . is cheap.Glitchy as hell.They copy and paste the characters as they always do.The option menu is useless.The video resolution looks like it was filmed through a potato.The audio is average.And the story sucked.Forget water-boarding . Forget Guantanamo bay . It does n't even come close to torture compared to this game . S* # $ , force a terrorist to play this game for 8 hours strait , and he 'll tell you on how to cure any form of cancer.I would not recommend this game to anyone , unless you want to yell at your TV screen all night .	-1
Mortal Kombat Mythologies sucked just as much as the other MK Adventure games.Those being of course , Special Forces and Shaolin Monks.The storyline in this game is set years and years before the first MK Tournament took place.I guess you could call it a pre-quel.The gameplay is absolutley terrible.The controls are very unresponsive and there are WAY too many cheap hits that you take in this game.MKM mixes both repetive digitized graphic gameplay and awful acting in FMV sequences.As many have said , this game is extremly difficult.Hell , I had a VERY hard time beating it , with cheat codes ... and with it being on very easy.All this mostly due to all the cheap hits that you get hit with by different enemies.There is also puzzle solving as well.Most of which will have you pulling out your hair.Overall , This game is crap and you should n't waste one dollar on it.Avoid this and the other two MK adventure titles as well .	-1
This controler stinks . The joystick is messed up and turned at a slight angle ( so you have to go slightly up and right to go straight up ) , the rubber grips fall off in the first week , and worst of all , it 's confusing . I tried programing the buttons ( because it 's & quot ; fully programable & quot ; ) and believe it or not it works ! sure you ca n't train whole sets of commands ( like moves in fighting games ) in , only replot the buttons but it works . The only problem comes in when you accidently press the clear button with a light in it and all of the sudden , none of the buttons perform the X action . Then , this controller will probably be unplugged and sent to the attic just like mine . Enjoy ! : (	-1
It 's pretty simple , here . Ultima games only became worth purchasing beginning with Ultima 7 . So you want three games if want old-school Ultima : Ultima 7 , Ultima 7 Serpents Isle , and Ultima 8 . The rest of the titles are just garbage , and that they want to charge a fortune for them now is just laughable . Is anybody really buying this ? And will your PC even play the older titles ? And would you even want it to ? They 're bad . I mean , really , really , bad.This is a nostalgia purchase , nothing more . It is to witness the evolution of RPG gaming , but definitely not to empty your bank account doing it.Ultima 7 and Ultima 7 Serpents Isle are still great fun to play ; Ultima 8 ? A little less so , mostly because it is smaller in scope . This is where the Baldur 's Gate Series began , which eventually spawned the Elder Scroll Games , so there is an historical component . Still , it 's just not worth this price . I might pay ten bucks or so to play these titles again ( maybe ) . Yeah , maybe .	-1
For starters this is an ok game ... .nothing more . The controls and gameplay suck hard compared to Quake and DOOM , the storyline sucks hard compared to Quake or DOOM and the multiplayer sucks hard compared to Quake or DOOM . So go play Quake or DOOM : )	-1
I used to love playing Quake 2 . I played it for hours on end . When I heard about it 's impending release in 1997 , I was stoked and could hardly wait for it to come out . And what did I do when it did ? I played it AT LEAST 3 to 4 days a week from 1997 to early 2002 . And guess what ? I became freakin sick of it ! I do not want to play this game ever again for the rest of my existence on this earth ! ! ( Well , at least for 10 years or so ) My point is , after you log hours and hours of gameplay , it starts to get old . FAST . Quake 2 may be a legendary game but I warn you do n't overindulge . Play Max Payne , Deus Ex or Unreal Tournament 2003 instead .	-1
I remember getting Hydro Thunder when it first came out on Sega Dreamcast . Even when I had bought it new ( a long time ago ) , I was n't too impressed . It was okay ... .But not a stand out in my opinion . It was like if Daytona USA ( which I think is better ) was transitioned into a water racer . And for a Dreamcast game , it sure looks visually like the N64 's typical graphics . The gameplay was simple controller-wise . And game-wise it was simple & repetitive . This is a game you 'd get more value out of , by playing against friends . Obviously a fair amount of people would dissagree w/ my opinions . While others may have similar thought 's on this title . I 'd say get it if : You find it for only a couple dollars.Your in need of adding games to your Dreamcast library.Or , you have played it or a game like it ... and liked it !	-1
This is one of 530 reviews so if you read this I consider myself lucky . Alright lets get to it . First off , it was a nice idea . Finally a game that focused on loving and caring , without being sexual , and helping your fellow man . However I think that this is all they focused on in production . The game , and this is sad for a Final Fantasy , is bad . I 'm sorry but it reeks . SquareSoft is running out of orginal ideas and it is showing . Although , the ideas were innovative . Enemies that level up with your characters . Never will your characters be gods over an enemy . Unless it 's a boss . For some odd reason boss levels are limited . So a player can beef up their characters all they want and then beat the messout of the boss without worry . The Guardian Forces , while still a nice idea , were poorly planned . A GF is like a Pokemon ( in a sick sadistic way ) . It gains levels with your character and through it your character can gain abilities . Problem is GFs can quickly make their 'host ' gods very quickly . At level 15 my main character 's strength was through the roof because not only did he have Ifirt equipped but all his strength increases too . He could cut down enemies in one blow ! While that 's nice it takes away from the difficulty of the game . The battle system is a nightmare too . If I have to push buttons to get more damage done , then why do n't you just program the game to register the extra damage . Granted this only applies to Squall but it gets very annoying to have to mash buttons to get a character 's strength up . I hated it in Super Mario RPG and I hate it in this game . The GF spells have to be pumped up if you want it to do any serious damage . What happened to watching the nice animations and appreciating the work of the artists who designed them . The story line is my next pet peeve . The strength of an RPG comes from the story not the gameplay . The story in this game is shoddy . Picture a writer with the exact opposite abilities of John Grisham or Micheal Crichton . It is that bad . Not only do you have to mash buttons in the battles but you have to mash buttons to get past the annoying long dialouge exchanges ( that seem to be written by a pre-schooler with help from their friends ) . It is worse than Parasite Eve 2 's story . At least they tried . I 'm done with my tirade now . You want the truth , this game is not worth [ price ] , it is n't even worth the rental . Go to a friend who owns this poor excuse for a game and play it there or borrow it . For those who saw the Charlie 's Angels movie . This is the game the two ( since when is it two player ) kids are playing when Barrymore pays them a visit .	-1
Final Fantasy 8 is the worst of the entire final fantasy series.As far as game play goes it holds up poorly . Getting new items equip is not a part of the system even though you can get items to upgrade your weapons nothing gets done about armor . Levels were pointless your increase was only a slight one . The monsters did profit a lot from the levels you gained though and you would easily be at level 99 halfway threw the game . The game does n't have many characters and the characters within do n't have as much personality is they did in FF7 . The only mini-game within it is a poorly done card game that gets boring fast . The GF system seems nice at first but quickly you find out that spending an hour getting the max amount of something is an easy way to over become powered and takes a lot of time . The only real control over your characters power level is how much patience you have for getting more spells into your GFs.As far as plot goes this game also hold up poorly to other games . It may start off fine but to avoid revealing too much I 'm just going to say by the second CD its going in a bad direction and it does n't turn around . Characters never get as interesting as they were in FF7 and when you 're on the third CD . ( I think ) You well hit the one plot stop that leaves only the strong of heart to actually bother finishing this sorry excuse for an RPG.The graphics are only strong point this game has . They are absolutely beautiful . Defiantly the best ever for when it was made . You may end up summoning GFs you do n't want to summon just to see the pictures they show when summoned.And finally as far as length of time it can stay interesting it 's a long game but its only interesting for about 4 hours into the game . If you need it it 's length is one you well need a long time to beat.Overall this game is not worth buying unless you really like pretty pictures .	-1
I 'm a huge Final Fantasy fan , but this ai n't no FF VII	-1
Before you get all jumpy about the Five Star Reviews for this game , read this . I 've been playing Final Fantasy games since 2 on the Super Nintendo ( 4 in Japan ) . At this point , I 've beaten IV-IX ... Some of them up to 3 times . Anyways , my point is do n't buy this game . If you play all the other Final Fantasies with their memorable soundtracks , developed characters , unforgettable plotlines , etc and then play this , you 'll wonder what you just payed for . The only thing this game has going for it are the graphics and pointless cinemas . This was one of those games where I would & quot ; pretend & quot ; that something good was going to happen..You know to make me feel like the game was worth playing . Nope . The characters are insanely dull and just ca n't make up their mind . One second Squall hates Rinoa and the next he & quot ; wants to be with her the rest of his life & quot ; and all that garbage . Love story..yeah right . The soundtrack is nothing that you 'll remember like the other games and the plot is just so ... confusing ? I still have NO IDEA what is going on in the last cinema . I mean the game just jumps to places with no explanation or reason . One second I 'm protecting this fisherman 's town , the next I 'm in space and then I 'm going to the future . That 's another thing I do n't understand . How will killing Ultimecia in the future affect the present ? More horrible storyline I guess . Also , Ultimecia just comes out of nowhere . She is the & quot ; third mage & quot ; who comes out of nowhere . She says like 4 lines in the whole game and really is n't evil or spooky . Like when I played FF VI and Kefka poisoned the Kingdom of Doma ... that was a true act of evil among many . Also , when Sephiroth killed Aeris in FF VII , I at least felt like she needed to be avenged . But Ultimecia is just some chick who needs some english lessons . That is all .	-1
Let 's just get one thing out of the way , the battle system in this game is bad . Very bad . There are much too many random battles , a lot of the time you 're & quot ; drawing & quot ; magic from enemies ( a HORRIBLE idea on square 's part , it makes no sense and is extremely tedious ) both to use and EQUIP it to your characters . Since the power of your equipped magic is based in the number you have , and all of your enemies have an unlimited number of the magics they 're able to carry , you spend a LOT ( a WHOLE lot , HOURS ) of time just hitting that draw button and selecting which magic to get from them . Yeah , not fun , at all . Both the equipment and magic systems are bad . The new focus on summoned monsters as equippable characters which level up and gain skills to boost your character , such as strength upgrades or upgrades to themselves which boost their damage or HP , is really not fun at all , since there 's zero strategy involved . You just level up and decide which skill they 'll learn after enough battles . I easily blew through the first half of this game , killing bosses in a ludicrously low number of hits . I could n't stand the second half , it was just more of the same , and the story line became very , very stupid . A select few will actually like this sappy love story mixed with something about a summoner going to destroy the world and some other junk that I just did n't care about . The love story was actually the best part , and the rest felt like a filler . There really is n't anything to praise about this game that separates it from previous Final Fantasy games . A sub-par RPG .	-1
If not for Final Fantasy IX switching gears , the franchise may have died from this title . FFVII was a pure marvel and still is , but VIII lacked any good storyline and the characters were n't the least bit interesting . It 's a solid piece if you want to have the entire series , let 's say , pull it out once in a while to hack at it . It 's hard to stay interested most of the time , although it does have some cool CG cut-scenes to do it justice , mostly , it 's dull repetition and sits as a rushed follow up to FFVII and it shows . Fans , thank God for IX saving the day , X bringing in the next-generation , and XI , XII coming up . So long from the dullsville FFVIII calls Balaamb . I hope the cadets have retired ...	-1
Good gravy ... This is the absolute worst game that I have ever played in my entire life . Not that the game was even that bad , but ... It never lived up to its own hype . I have played all of the Final Fantasy games ... Since I beat the very first game , I have been a loyal follower and a ruthless critic . I cherished IV , and I absolutely LOVE VI , which is indeed the very best one in the entire series in terms of story and music . And Final Fantasy VII blew my mind ... The Final Fantasy ... In a whole different perspective , with three dimensions on the battlefield . When FFVIII came out , I already had a copy reserved ... I held the glowing package in my hands , looked at the back of the cover and drooled over the beautiful graphics , and in my head I could imagine the enchanting score that my ears would soon be treated to . But as my best friend and I put the disk in and beheld Final Fantasy VIII ... There was a voice screaming in my head ... My mind kept saying something to me over and over again as I walked through Balamb Garden ... And then my friend said that very thought : & quot ; Jay , this game sucks. & quot ; Yes , it does . This game is a disgrace to the series . A storyline that is so slow , so pointless that you actually look forward to the battle sequences ? There was no Final Fantasy VIII Theme ! The battle theme and the boss theme pale in comparison to the vicious relentless music of the FFVII Score . There was not one piece of music that ever persuaded me to continue the journey . The disgustingly weak plot was made tolerable only by the CG movies . The character development was never there . Never did we ever find out why Seifer was such a jerk . ... Or WHY the GFs ( Ha , ha ) erased the memories of the characters . The lead character , Squall , answered every single question with the word & quot ; whatever. & quot ; Compare that to the strong-willed , heartbroken Cloud from FFVII , and it becomes obvious . Allow me to say one more thing : Final Fantasy VI gripped me . I captivated me with a spell that bound me . I played , played , and played that silly game , with it 's cute 16 bit graphics , as if I were possessed . The same goes for VII . I wanted to know what was going to happen next at that moment . I got as far as the mission to Timber in FFVIII , and never gave it a second glance . Only a year later , after exams were done in college , with no car or friends around ... Did I pull Final Fantasy VIII out again to give it a second chance . How sad . The only time I ever cried over a video game was when Aeris died in Cloud 's arms ... But when I first played Final Fantasy VIII , I know that I wanted to just bawl .	-1
I 'm a huge Final Fantasy guy , but for me , 8 is just very close to trash . I tried to play it right when it came out but I could n't stand it right from the get go so I quit early . I tried to play it again a few years ago and the same exact thing happened . Finally a little while ago , I forced myself through it . No exaggeration.So I started the game for the third time thinking , hey maybe it just takes time to catch on . But no , I never really became addicted to the gameplay as I usually do in FF games . The only way to get stronger is to find monsters with different spells and steal their spells for your attributes , which is fine and all , but it got extremely annoying having to do that until you reach 100 and for each character ! It does n't sound necessary but trust that 's the only way to get stronger because as your level goes up , so do monster levels , so yes there 's no point in even leveling up . Really stupid in my opinion , but it 's a different type of thing that I think some people actually did like . Not me . Every other FF was great as they were because they did not deviate the gameplay to this extent.For every thing else , the story was a definite plunge from 7 . FF7 blew everyone away and when this cam out , the characters were ok , but the story was pretty lame , but not too , too terrible and the music was forgettable . The environments were about matched with that of 7 , but less enjoyable . So overall , this is not a great game.I feel like this game is extremely overrated , getting so much positive feed back , but for what ? My expectations were much higher after being so impressed by 7 . Maybe the bar was just set too high . Maybe Square needed a break . Then again , there are obviously people who love this style of gameplay , which gives them a much more different gaming experience . Do n't get me wrong , it 's not the worst game ever , but it 's just not the same Final Fantasy experience everyone loves.So bottom line , if you 're new to final fantasy and have n't played this yet , I would say consider a different FF game . But give it a chance if you 're not that picky with RPGs . Just do n't expect much .	-1
as you might have heard , this game was downright terrible . the only thing that kept me going was the story . in my personal opinion , the story is very exceptional and the many months of work they put into it paid off . before starting , i would like to comment that i was very excited to get this game after the two-in-a-row masterpieces final fantasy 6 and 7 , and for the fact that it was created by squaresoft , but i was extremely disappointed after about one hour of gameplay . now onto the review ... STORY : 9/10as you have most likely heard , people say that this storyline is based on the theme of love , when in many people 's opinion ( my own included ) , this game is anything BUT love . the only thing close to love that happens is **SPOILER**rinoa and squall kiss at the ending**END SPOILER**which really isnt all that loveable in my opinion.similar to final fantasy VII , the setting is in the future ( irritating downside , as insanely advanced technology is not that fantasy-like ) , but this is a mediocre downside of the gameThe story goes pretty much like this : an evil sorceress is on the verge of enslavement of the world and a resistance to defeat this woman called Garden trains military soldiers called SeeDs to battle against her and her troops . pretty lame sounding , as seed and garden are really actually one of those ideas that a first grader could come up with in about 5 minutes , but the story actually picks up at about disk three ( yes it is pretty slow ) .SOUND AND MUSIC 6.5/10the sound is really quite good in this game . squall 's sword slashes when hitting a target , quistis 's whip cracks when snapping at a target , and Zell 's mighty fists make smacking noises when hitting a target.such as final fantasy VII , the music in here is not that well conceived and memorable such as the earlier final fantasys . the boss music is sort of catchy ( once again such as final fantasy VII ) , but the rest of the music is rather annoying.GAMEPLAY 2/10the single thing that totally MAULS this game is the gameplay . the battling is terribly tedious , and the magic system is completely raped of its glory . instead of learning magic abilities , now you waste time & quot ; drawing & quot ; magic from enemies . another terrible mistake squaresoft made while making this game.a new addition to the gameplay is the Guardian Forces ( GF ) which are pretty much summons just in a stupid term . these guardian forces are pretty much the only thing that will keep you alive in this game , as you need them to enhance health , strength , and so on , which i will get to in a moment . the guardian forces are the main attack force , and with these forces there is barely any need for the & quot ; attack & quot ; command ( other than Zell 's Duel limit break ) . The animations for guardian forces are well animated , but EXTREMELY long and tedious.Limit breaks are the only other useful thing in this game , but unfortunately , they can only be accessed when you are in life-threatening situation , completely aboliting the well-conceived limit break bar.MENUS AND PUT-TOGETHERS 1/10this is terribly time-consuming and irritating . the menu is where i spent most of my time on this game . gladly , squaresoft got rid of the horrid materia system and added on the god-how-could-this-get-any-worse junction system . this system takes about a half of an hour just to understand , and then you spend even more precious hours of your life drawing magic upgrading it so a boss can not kill you in just one blow . for example , you have to spend about an hour drawing 100 lifes from an enemy just so you can raise your health a couple thousand points.then after this boring proccess you must draw 100 Tornados in order to raise your attack power ( I am almost completely CERTAIN this process is required to defeat the final boss ) The second complete worst part of this game is the following : THERE IS NO LONGER AN EQUIP OPTION ! what happened to equipping weapons and armor ? there is a way to upgrade your weapon , but that consumes serious time and involves ridiculous side-quests that are extremely boring . dont even bother going through the stress of completing these questsa ridiculous thing they did in this game is that the characters level up with you , so you can finish the game at level 8 or so ( as leveling up is not necessary and bosses give you NO experience points { I completed it at level 7 or 8 } ) GRAPHICS 9.5/10The best part of the game , the graphics . The FMV scenes are superior to every other graphics i have EVER seen in my entire life-span ( yes including ps2 graphics ) , and even during gameplay the graphics are superior ( during gameplay they are worse than ps2 graphics i might add ) , and the only flaw in them is the pixelations , as the characters look a bit fuzzy . but that problem is solved in FFIX.You remember the disgustingly distorted characters in FFVII ? well , thank god , they are replaced with actual human-like figures that look like HUMANS at last . no more stubby oversized arms and legs with huge heads that remind me of cartoons.there is only one thing i love about this game , and it is the ending . as i said before , the story is VERY good and is the only reason that i gave it 2 stars instead of 1. the ending is EXTREMELY good ( not as good as FFVI 's though ) and made me feel good.REPLAY VALUE : 0/10as many other people have done , as soon as i finished wasting my time playing this game and finally destroyed the final boss i took out the disk from my playstation , placed it in its case , placed in on a shelf behind my other cds , and it has not been touched ever since . this game was terrible , and i wish i had my 30 hours of gameplay back . i say instead of even thinking of buying this game , look for final fantasy anthology and final fantasy 6 instead .	-1
Good gravy . What was Squaresoft thinking when they made this one ? ! It 's terrible in almost every aspect.First of all , the battle system involves having to siphon off magic spells from the enemies and grafting them into your abilities . This means that if you use them , your skills actually decrease . Not only that , but because the maximum level your characters can reach is 100 instead of 99 , you 're actually susceptible to the nervewracking `` Level 5 Death '' spell.Secondly , the cast is shallow and characterless . The main character is grumpy and unsociable , and this reviewer could not relate to him as a player should be able to . Also , none of the other cast are very memorable , like the characters of the other Final Fantasy games.Lastly , the story is about as intriguing and deep as a pile of ... well , you get the idea . The story begins all right , but then lapses into a nauseating , mismatched soap opera between the main character and his rival 's ex . Not only that , but the main character 's attitude prevents the gamer from learning what the `` villain '' is really after ; they never give you a deep enough look at her.So , really , if you 're a Final Fantasy fan , skip this one . You did n't miss anything .	-1
When people play a Final Fantasy game they expect several things to come out of the finished game ! For one thing a great story , great charicters , cool battle system , drama , comedy , and greatness , cool graphics , and overall a great game ! That said and done Final Fantasy VIII is the worst example of how to make a great RPG ! When a great RPG company like Squaresoft , who been making the best RPG 's for years now , comes in and makes a game , people expect it to be great ! ! ! Esspecally if it 's a Final Fantasy game ! Well let me tell you that Final Fantasy VIII is anyting BUT a great RPG ! ! ! In fact this game is so pooryly thought out I am at a loss of words ! I 'm sure you 've already herd complaints about the complicated battle system , cumcumber ( And glitched ) plot , and lack of charicter developement ! So I 'll spare you the details for once ! Lets just say Final Fantasy VIII not only gives the Final Fantasy series a bad name , but it also gives RPG 's as a whole a bad name ! Thank you . Have a nice day !	-1
If you fell in love with Final Fantasy VII , like I did , and are so hungry for more that you are considering this game , I beg of you , do n't do it . It is nothing like the aforementioned masterpiece . The story was slow to get going , which I was sympathetic to , since it was like that in FF VII too , but after hours it was still lame . For one thing , you have a `` military ranking '' , and it goes down when you explore the towns ! I mean come on , the whole point of an RPG is exploring ! But that is not the worst part . The magic system has been redone , and it 's HORRIBLE . Instead of the product-of-genius Materia system in FF VII , they have the `` draw system '' . You have to collect magic spells , and use them , like petty items ! This is , by far , the worst idea ever.And then there were the characters . After falling under the spell of Cloud , Aeris , Sephiroth and all the rest , I felt like hiding under my blankets and sobbing after meeting Squall , Rinoa and the other lame characters . Their dialogue is lifeless and cheesy , and I did n't feel attached to them at all.Although it 's a small complaint , I must mention the graphics . The cutscenes are amazing and far better than FF VII 's , but everything else is awful . The blocky , toon-like models of FF VII have been tossed out , replaced by characters that try to shove in the detail of real humans in tiny little models . The result ? Stiffly animated , bland graphics.Overall , do not buy this game . Buy Tales of Symphonia , Chrono Cross ... anything . Please , do not waste your money . These are the parting words of a weeping gamer . Thank you .	-1
this is the worst final fantasy game gameplay wise without a doubt . not only is the learning curve hours , but after that , you have to spend hours getting magic from the enemies to use and equip . This game graphic wise looks like it has been in work for a lifetime , and the FMV looks like PS2 or DC . the gameplay looks like it was made in a lifetime too , and that is a BAD thing .	-1
Final Fantasy 7 and 9 are wonderful examples of how an essentially linear game can be manipulated and changed into something epic and enthralling , thanks to excellent characterisation and plot . Final Fantasy 8 ( and , oddly enough , FF 10 ) are wonderful examples of how to bore people silly while forcing them to sit through some nice-looking battles.For those gamers who , like me , need to like a character in order to fully appreciate the game 's plot , let me say this : Squall is a moody , horrible , angst-ridden Phallocrat . His supporting cast are forgettable , with the exceptions of the consummately annoying Zell Dincht and the ridiculously feeble Rinoa Heartilly . The characters in FF 8 have none of the appeal of Cloud et al from FF 7 , or Zidane and the lovable half-breeds from FF 9.For gamers who do n't consider this to be so important , FF 8 still manages to nicely ruin the Final Fantasy reputation by being one of the most boring and unrewarding games in the series . Battles are innumerable and completely random , and fall into 2 categories : extremely easy and unfairly difficult . Case in point ; you face Seifer 's two main flunkies early on in the game , by which stage your levels are too high to build up quickly on the feeble monsters available in the college & amp ; the surrounding areas , and too low to beat these henchmen without massive amounts of luck . The result ? You end up running about doing frustrating battle with low-level wildebeests for hours , and the game becomes very , very boring.The graphics are shamefully poorly-thought out . The pre-rendered backdrops for some of the major levels ( Balamb Garden , Edea 's House ) are bland , and have none of the charm of the cityscapes of FF 7 or the magical countryside vistas of FF 9 . The character models are far too complex , and look pixellated and rough at almost all angles . Polygon pop-up did n't die out with the Sega Saturn ; it 's alive and well and working for Squaresoft . The pre-renders , however , are amazing , approaching the quality of early PS 2 titles in their scale and realism.The sound is run-of-the-mill poor PlayStation fare , but the music is decent enough . Better , too , is the Magic system , where , instead of spending hours confusing yourself with Materia , you now Junction Elementals and spells . Sadly , the game relies less on Magic and more on difficult Limit Break techniques and expensive items , so this really is n't a huge plus until late in the game.All in all , FF 8 is a VERY disappointing game , lacking the freedom of exploration of FF 7 and 9 . It 's a game on wheels , which is n't a bad thing in itself , but when the plot and characters are so forgettable , it becomes a major problem . Steer clear .	-1
The Game is sow Boring the story is not good at all final 7 is so much beter get that ...	-1
Final Fantasy is , and has been for a long time , Squaresoft 's flagship product . All the FF products , while not having direct connections to each other , carry similar & quot ; themes & quot ; -- similarities of gameplay , world design , and so on that make them clearly Final Fantasy rather than something else.With all the time and effort ( not to mention money ) expended on them , one would ( I think justifiably ) expect that the series would generally improve as time went on . Unfortunately , this is not the case.Final Fantasy VII was a reasonably good FF game , but it was also the first Playstation FF game , and had some advantages which were , at the time , unique to it . It was incumbent upon FFVIII to give us something more -- something cooler and better . It failed.The overall STORY is n't that bad -- the plot is decent and some of the characters interesting . However , our main character is just not generally likeable ; Squall has less interesting personality than Cloud Strife of FFVII , and that 's a pretty damning indictment since Cloud did n't develop much personality until some way through the game . More importantly , gameplay is if anything more of a railroading exercise than FFVII -- which , given that VII used the metaphor of a railroad from the beginning , is a sad state of affairs.By now , Square should have recognized that flexibility of play and so on is a GOOD thing in CRPGs . Chrono Trigger remains popular enough to garner commentary even today , due in great part to its multi-ending design . Why the FF series still relies on the idea that you have no real choices and get dragged from fight to fight boggles the mind ; Kewl Komputer Animation does n't make up for the fact that they have n't added any new game techniques since the Nintendo days . Oh , they have some cute little side games -- card collecting and so on -- but the story itself is n't even captivating enough . Some of the battles can go on long enough to be boring in themselves . Oh , the animation cutscenes are pretty , and some of the music very nice -- and the past timeline sequence is , sadly , more interesting than the main one.A disappointing effort from the people who have , in past times , produced some of the most innovative and interesting games .	-1
What a poor excuse for a Final Fantasy game , this game should have never came to america . Sure , the graphics are great but the characters make me sick and the plot seems like it came right from a Baby Sitter 's Club Book . The main character Squall is suffereing from teenaged agnst , please . Oh , and the magic system ( the draw and juctioning system- great idea ... ahahahahahahaha . If you want a GOOD Final Fantasy get 7 , 9 , and 2 , or 3 ( 4 and 6 for those people who think that they know Japanese . ) Just stay as far away from this game as you possibly can ! ! ! !	-1
ok , I admit if I known how bad this game was I still would have bought the game , but I wish I would had waited until the game went down to $ 19.99 before I wasted almost $ 50.00 for it . I hope Square makes FF9 better before they waste millions of dollars on another crap shoot.Now for my reasons for the 1 star.1 . It was a rip off of FF7 . if you want to get FF8 but havent played FF7 get FF7.2 . Why no voice acting ! I sooooooo recomend it ! C'mon Square at least on the CG movies ( pease let FF9 have voice acting ) ! 3 . The characters in the game not just the playable ones but all of them seem to have no life to them , its just boring how the characters are so dull , I just cant explain it.4 . Rushed , rushed , rushed , and , rushed . C'mon Square where is this quality gaming I remember from your other stuff like Chrono Trigger and old classics like that.5 . I dont have anough time to tell you the rest but there is alot of other stuff .	-1
i got this game and did n't really play it my brother mostly did and he said is was an awesome game until you get to near the end of the second disc and it freezes at a bossthe only down fall is that you my regret buying the used oneits a good game if it worked properly	-1
Could have been a lot better . to put it simply , to perhaps the biggest final fantasy fan ever , me , i was totally diappointed by this game . i hate the whole modern/futuristic look that this game has . even ff7 had this to a point . i want this to be like fantasy..castles , swords , mages , kings , knights , wizards . i hate that there is no armor or accessories , plus i hate that there are no magic points , and magic is not earned . the experience points thing stinks . leveling up/money mean nothin in this game . my favorite part of RPG is building up wrecking machine armies . ergo my sabin , celes , edgar , and terra army from ff3/6 . in this game the enemies level up with you so theres no point in leveling yourself up . this game is soooo dumbed down . the villain or lack thereof is horrible . BRING BACK KEFKA ! the gf 's take like 20 years to finish making battles so annoying , instead of fun like in ff6 and chrono cross . the storyline is terrible and the characters are too real looking . plus every character is essentially the same , each character does not have unique abilities except for the limit breaks . maybe if square had released this game under a different title not final fantasy 8 i woulnt have been disappointed . this remains the only ff game ever that i havent finished , i stopped playing on disc 3. if u want a good RPG to play , get FF9 which goes back to hardcore fantasy and the original ways that made final fantasy so great . also i recommend ff3/6 which is undoubtable the best FF game ever , and arguably the best game ever . i also recommened chrono trigger and chrono cross which are totally awesome games . dont waste your time or money with final fantasy 8 .	-1
I am the type of RPG gamer who likes to chop heads off , burn down castles , pillage villages and slay dragons . I do n't like to go to Macy 's or Talbots and buy a blowdryer so I can fight the next cosmo-monster . This one sucks . Final Fantasy should go back to its roots and deal with a true story , like FF3 , FF7 or FF9 . The ending was a confused mess- good graphics , but what were the storywriters for this ending smoking ? I am not chauvinistic , but this is one chick-flick game if there is any . Not for head-chopping , castle-burning , dragon-slaying guys like me . One star for the Square title and graphics .	-1
If you want yet another dogfight game , here it is . If you want a game where you feel as though you are commanding a starship , as depicted in the Star Trek movies , you had better pass . Cut scenes ? Wow , impressive , and with David Warner no less ! Graphics ? NONE BETTER ! Neat way to blow stuff up ? Oh , yea ! A great game for those under 30 with cat like reflexes . No cunning needed here . However , you had better be more practised in an immelman turn than the corbomite bluff if you want to suceed at this game , and that precisly is the opposite of what is advertised .	-1
This is rapeing the Quake name now ID ... ... .Get the Quake 1 magic and actually interesting story of Quake 1 back . Quake 3 , 4 , and 2 suck .	-1
Absolutely the worst game in the excellent Quakes . This certainly bombed the whole trilogy with its gameplay . What I hate about this game is the nonstop mindless shooting where you do n't have to think . Getting killed in this game also causes alot of anger because everyone just jumps around you and constantly fires ! This game is just like UT , bad . Utterly bad ! I have constantly tried to like it , but failed at every attempt . Avoid at all costs !	-1
this game should marketed as a MULTIPLAYER ONLY ! ! ! The graphics are gorgeous , however there is nowhere to explore and nothing to find.I only have a 56k modem - absolutely not fast enough . One has to have a super fast cable modem to play this & quot ; deathmatch & quot ; game online	-1
This was always bound to be a great title , the Quake name is like a way of printing money ! but this time I am just not buying it ! I do n't have a very high spec PC and Quake 3 just runs like a dog ! ( it 's a AMD K6-2 350 with 128Mb of RAM and an ATI Rage Magnum with 32Mb ) my message to people out there with this spec of PC or below , do n't bother with Q3 , there is a very good alternative & quot ; Unreal Tournement & quot ; it 's a brilliant title that runs sweet on my machine in 800x600 in 32 BIT colours ( colors ! ) . In summery Q3 Great title , but you will need an ass kicking spec .	-1
Wow look at the pretty engine . THere I have said everyhting good about this . I swear progreammers are more interested in pretty than contenet . I would rather play Doom than this . Quake3 is all glitz and no depth . Where is the story ? Where ? It left with Romero when he went to form IonStorm	-1
Why did you do this id ? No wait . . . I understand why , but it 's still no excuse to create a game like this . Multiplayer only ? OK , OK , I need to settle down here . First of all I need to explain my situation . I have Internet access but not the kind to play this game , I have a lowly 56k modem with a ( insert appropriate insult here ) connection . This type of connection is definitely not the best connection , even for games that have low data transfer like Diablo or Ultima . However , in my apartment complex we created our own Ethernet LAN with the main hub in my own apartment , perfectly ideal for this type of game . Does this mean that I play this game ? Yes , sort of . Does that mean that I like it ? I wish I could.I 've rewritten this paragraph four times already . There is no way to express my dislike for this game . Simply put , players will get separated into two groups . Those with the skills to pummel anyone who comes into the arena , and those who get pummeled . Unfortunately , the & quot ; Pummelers & quot ; are few and far between . Most of the & quot ; pummeled & quot ; will be amateurs , they 'll buy the game , play through a few deaths and erase the game from their hard drive . My LAN mysteriously & quot ; empties & quot ; out when I offer up a game of Q3 . id blew it with this one . Poorly thought out , this game serves only the elite few with the grit , skill , determination , and fast connection to play this game . Lets hope that id gets a brainstorm and comes up with an actual story line for the next game instead of taking the easy way out like they did with this one.Remember , I 'm not saying the multiplayer is bad . The multiplayer is awesome ! It 's the lack of the single player that makes this game blow . In fact , it 's the lack of everything else that makes me want to lose my lunch .	-1
I did n't quite like it for the following reasons 1-when fighting , ai acts pretty dumb , and is way too easy to defeat . 2-game is waaaaaaaaaaay too short , i finished it in 2 1/2 hours , and i 'm not even good with adventures ... 3-the game would have been maybe a hit if they 'd have put at least 3 and in bnest case 5 to 7 of those missions the game 'd have been worth its money 4-you do n't get the freedom of acting , in training on vulcan nerve pinch when trying to use phaser it does n't work , same 's when you try to use phaser or vulcan nerve pinch on picard or data or son'a while they 're still not against you ... but on the plus side here 's what most trekkies will find interesting about the game 1-you get to see corridors of enterprise and their main engineering . 2-you get to meet picard , data and beverly 3-you get to run around like a mad idiot with a phaser 4-you get to shoot son'a and another race , which i 'm not gon na reveal , do n't wan na spoil it gor you 5-you get to explore a sci-fi looking son'a colony 6-you get a chance to promote your ensign sovok to leitenant ( i 'm sorry if i spelled it wrong ) 7-you get to use nerve pinch , but you do n't get a chance very often , only 4 times in the game ] overall-trekkies might like it , but as an adventure , it stinks	-1
Although a lot of people liked this game I hated it . For one thing this game was WAAAAYYYYYY too easy ( I beat this game in three days playing only 1 hour a day ! The first game had me playing for mounths ! ) ! You 're supposed to find this fairy to give you all your powers back , and yet you start the game with all your powers ! Plus I do n't care how good the graphics are , Rayman does NOT look good in 3D and does not belong in 3D ! So get the first game , I do n't recomend this game to ANYONE ! And you know what 's worse ? This Nintendo 64 vertion looks WORSE and plays WORSE than the Dreamcast vertion ! Now that 's sad ( Even though I never liked N64 ) .	-1

This game is Civ II meets D & amp ; D. Its horrible . One of my five LEAST favorite games .	-1
Stunning graphics coupled with very clumsy controls make this game a feast for the eyes but a major bust when it comes to engrossing game play . In a world dominated by such near master works as Lucas Arts ' Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine , different is not necessarily better and the third person perspective Nocturne offers is as creepy as the games beautifully dark images and spine tingling story line . I suppose the object was to give Nocturne a cinematic edge offered by some of Hollywood 's best horror/thrillers , but cutting from place to place using numerous movie angels as our gruff but hardly lovable anti-hero `` Stranger '' runs through each scene ( ground level , over-head , etc ) trying to mow down swooping and snarling creatures of the night , simply does n't work here and would likely earn any film student a solid D for effort ! With one additional option , first person perspective ( or even second person ) , this might have been a great game , without it , Nocturne swiftly becomes little more than a tedious test of your 20/20 vision and manual dexterity . Bottom line , if you can get it cheap ( one major home electronics store recently had it on sale for $ 9.99 ) , or can borrow it from a friend , check it out for it 's amazing cutting edge eye candy . But just like any fine work of art hanging in some posh museum , you 'll pause to consider Nocturne 's brilliant textures , along with it 's use of light and shadow but eventually you 'll move on to something much more stimulating and rewarding , like an amusement park .	-1
Before I bought this game , I downloaded the demo off theinternet and was completely freaked out . I rushed out and purchasedthe game and was completely freaked out by the money I wasted . Do you love impossible control options , very high system requirements and load times that have you kicking your computer ? Then you will love Nocturne ! This game had all the perfect elements to become a great game , but it fell short on delivery . However , if you love the Resident Evil genre , then this game is for you , but I warned you . END	-1
This looked like a promising game and I really enjoyed it ... when I could progress through it . It was crashy/buggy on win2k . I was halfway thru the werewolf town episode and hit a bug that no patch fixed unless I restarted the episode , which I was too [ upset ] to do.Also , the way to progress is not really that intuitive . I found myself running around an empty castle a lot trying to figure out wth I 'm supposed to do next . By far the worst aspect of this game was the camera angles . As you run down a hall , you hit a map trigger that changes your point of view ; unfortunately you have no idea what view you will get . Sometimes you will be looking ahead from behind/above your character , other times you will look at your character 's face from ahead/left . It is weird and extremely unpleasant as you can switch angles during fights accidentally and get your [ rear-end ] kicked.The good stuff : The graphics are cool , not the most impressive nowadays ( 2003-05-06 ) but still neat . Although they are n't technically superior anymore ( they once were ) I still like the way the game looks because the designers made the graphics so creepy . The art on the walls , the dark woods , crypts , you go through all sorts of cool settings.The music is creepy too , and really helps set the mood . This is actually a scary game to play.The main character is pretty cool . He 's the nameless Clint-Eastwood type with the gravelly voice.All in all this game had awesome potential but was poorly executed . Much of this could have been avoided by having 1. more predictable and sane camera angles , and 2. a strategy guide . A lot of times I was stuck for hours and I missed some hidden place or something . With a quick cheat I would have had a lot more fun without feeling too guilty.I hope they come out with a Nocturne 2 that addresses these issues , I would really like to see it .	-1
I got this game last year and I have only just completed it . In a technical sense , this is indeed better than the other TR games . But I do feel that it is a victim of it 's own realisticness . It starts off brilliant and great to play . Especialy the moving train effect . But once you get to the 'City of the Dead ' things go downhill . I mean it gets so dark that even with the monitor on full brightness and the house lights out , you still have to lightflares to see whats what . There are also not enough flares to get around with either . Sure this would be the situation in real life , but in real life you have the advantage of 3D vision to guide you . Not in a game . Not only that , but the levels get boring towards the end aswell . It seems stupid that game programmers would spend out on high-tech graphics and creative innovations and then blanket them with an over abundance of darkness . Apart from that though . The sound is brilliant . The movies realy fit in well . Lara looks better and ( if you can see them ) the graphics are great too .	-1
Well , I wish I could play some of these levels ! Sometimes , that 's made impossible because they 're so dark . I wish it would save my game , too , but it never has . There are patches available for bigger mistakes on their site . I would give anything not to watch those grating cutscenes again and again . The voices are all quite annoying and stilted , though you get the sense the Eidos guys thought the old man at the beginning might have been - he gets tiresome immediately ( my child this , my child that , this is how you jump -WAIT ! - this is how you jump ) . Lara is still a bimbo character and it 's insulting to both genders , a cynical view of the audience ( I wish she would stop breathing heavily ! ) . The controls are difficult . The puzzle elements are still worthwhile , though they are a poor man 's Zelda . The 16 year-old Lara was unnecessary , when she gets her backpack we 're supposed to care . The likelyhood of her and the old man being in these Cambodian ruins in the daytime and running through it like a preschool adventure playset is small . They seem to toss old TR elements like climbing vines and throwing levers in all the wrong places , these elements are repeated , and there seems to be little real joy in all of it , like they toss the elements out until the game ends . The level designs are unlogical , they detract from the realism that the games used to have and added so much to it . That 's why you are bothered when you die from a giant spinning spike wheel that magically floats , not because it 's hard , but because you just do n't believe things like that are there , it 's as though the game breaks it 's own rules . I feel like the levels could all have gone a lot further if they just did some heavy internet research on the areas available to play ( Egypt has stars and spikes ? ) . Overall , I feel this game was well worth my [ money ] , but the series needs to improve or it will surely die . Undoubtedly , the first Two TR games were the best , they need to return to that , these new games feel like a ... commercial spectacle . What I enjoy most about the series is the realism that there can sometimes be , and the puzzles , but mostly the scenery and locales , the action is just the backdrop to me . Buy the first 2 games before thinking about getting this .	-1
It sure does . Old , boring , hard to play and hard to control . This game is more fun than a sharp stick to the eye but not by much . And the price when it first came out ! Sheesh ! I 'm betting that the only reason some people buy this is Lara 's chest and that does'nt justify purchasing this accident of a game .	-1
Tomb Raider : The Last Revelation is the fourth Lara Croft adventure game based entirely in Egypt . A very long and challenging game built on a nice engine with great graphics , Neat animations and neat sound effects . Good storyline and great gameplay with infinite saves . Awesome lighting effects and a creepy atmosphere . Great puzzles but a lot of annoying false paths . Very challenging gameplay but can be too challenging at times because no difficuly option . Good level design with a helpfull training level , But the hub level layout is very confusing and easy to get lost . A Lot of fun doing all the jumping but the controls are as usual very badly done , Auto aim is not perfect and the manual aiming is impossible . Enemy AI is super dumb . Tomb Raider Last Revelation well deserves 4 stars but i will give it only 2 because it does not have good key controls and a difficulty option .	-1
I played this a lot when it first came out , when my computer of the time had win 98 . It was a fun game and still would be to play again . But I can not play this on my Windows XP or 7 PC 's . Its full of glitches that are impossible to fix . To play it you 'd have to skip levels because , for instance , you get to a point where you can not make lara jump to a ledge she needs to get to to continue . Then you skip a level and this happens again . Like i said , unplayable unless you maybe had an older comp-i do n't know why the game will start and run but then glitch in the middle of a level and i do n't know if there is a fix because i 've never seen a game do this .	-1
Before buying this game , I strongly recommend downloading the demo off their website first . As a fan of many of the & quot ; God Games & quot ; out there , I found this one very unintuitive . In short , all of the people are stupid and the game itself does some very dumb things.For instance , there are points in the demo where the farmworkers just sit there and drown as the Nile River rises . The question is n't & quot ; what 's causing this person to just sit there & quot ; ... the question is & quot ; why is this even occurring ? & quot ; That 's just one example , there are many , many , more . Another example ? Ok , I got to a point in the game where half of the population would just leave . Then , six months later , they 'd all return again just to repeat the same process again and again year after year . Does this make any sense ? I found all the micromanagement to be very tiring . The object of the game is n't to build an empire , it 's to figure out all the stupid little workarounds it takes to make these people do what they should be doing without any thought.This is just the demo , folks ! I strongly suggest you see for yourself before you drop your cash on the real deal.Derek	-1
Pharaoh is a city building game ( like SimCity ) , but set in Egypt , during the pre-dynastic period . You start by building a settlement , addressing basic needs and continue onward . Unlike SimCity , there are various goals to hit such as population goals.As the game progresses , it gets harder.Unfortunately , I found myself building and managing the population , but having to check the deities almost constantly . Unless you hold regular festivals , constantly build shrines , the gods will grow angry and exact revenge on your civilization . I found it to be more tedious than fun .	-1
When Diablo II came out I bought it immediately expecting it would be at least as fun as the first possibly more fun.I got bored of the game easily . The thing I really did n't like was certain enemys that just run away . You have to chase them for what seems like an eternity till you finally catch them and slaughter them , and if you decide to just let them run away they 'll continuously come back to haunt you . Then to make things worse the game does n't save what you 've killed so if you decide your done playing for the day the next time you play all the runners will be back . These enemys are called flayers and when I first encountered them I got bored of fighting them over and over and discontinued my gameply and moved to a different game.Another thing I did n't like is running . Not that running is bad , in fact I love the fact that you can move faster , the problem with it is that the background ( trees , grass , etc . ) really bothered my eyes with it scrolling past so quickly . That is not as big a deal as the run-a-way enemys , however.If you like to chase endless hords of enemys then the game is for you . If not do n't bother with it .	-1
If you like clicking banners and advertisements off your screen you will love this game , cause thats all it is , clicking annoying flying/popping graphics off your screen .	-1
wow . i bought this game hoping that blizzard had stopped going half way on their games ( which is clearly evident in games like , starcraft , warcraft , diablo ) well i bought this game , and it was stupid . this is what i affectionately call a `` clicker '' game . you know , i left click on you , i hit you , i right clic on you , i do a magic thing . boring . they try to make it interesting with the whole unique character thing , but the fact that it 'll always be the same thing , every time you play it , does n't really give you much re-play value . also a killer is the mandatory quests , you must complete every quest in order to move on in the already dull plot . if you really want a real RPG , buy Baldur 's Gate , it 's cheaper , and you get to completely make your character , and there 's a totally non-linear plot . do waht you want , or do n't , but be prepared to suffer the consequences . Baldur 's Gate puts YOU the gamer in control , while diablo 2 , you are just kinda along for the ride . diablo 2 is deffinitely a game for those simple-minded gamers , who do n't really like the whole variable plot thing , the ones that do n't like having a choice where to go or what to do when they want to , the ones who just want to click their way to victory . this game gets one star , which is many , many more than it deserves	-1
Let 's get one thing clear : Diablo II is nowhere near as good as Diablo 1 . There are more reasons for this than I can remember , but I 'll try to list as many of them as possible.First off , there 's no way to save your progress through the game . All that you can do is save your character . When you reload the game , all of the bad guys are back . This gets EXTREMELY aggravating.Second , there 's just too much stuff ! Remember in Diablo 1 , where there were a dozen kinds of swords and like a hundred different kinds of armor , not counting the two billion magical prefixes and suffixes and all of the Unique items ? Well , that 's ten times as bad in D2 . There 's twice as many different categories of items ( belts ? what the ... ? ) , and there are twice as many items in each category . It does n't stop there , either : it is now possible for nonmagic items to have prefixes as well , and many of those prefixes mean the same freaking thing ! A belt can be `` poorly made , '' `` low quality , '' `` slightly lower quality , '' `` chipped , '' `` cracked , '' `` rusty , '' `` damaged , '' `` even more damaged , '' blah blah blah blah blah umpteen et cetera , and it contributes absolutely JACK FREAKING SQUAT to gameplay ! Diablo 1 had 2 different potion strengths : Partial and Full , and that was all you needed , but D2 saw fit to create five different potion strengths . You get the idea.Third , the outdoor areas are WAAY too freaking big . Even with Automap turned on , it 's impossible to tell whether or not you 've explored an outdoor area fully.Fourth , the new spellcasting system just does n't make the slightest bit of sense . A Barbarian at a given level will have just as many magical abilities , AND be just as good at casting them , as a Sorceress on the same level ! And how are these magical abilities acquired ? Does your character learn spells by reading spellbooks , like in Diablo 1 ? No , they learn spells by killing things . Yup , you just go out and kill monsters , and you suddenly know how to cast fireballs . WHAT THE HECK KIND OF SENSE DOES THAT MAKE ? ! ? Fifth , character classes have no maximum stats . This SEVERELY WEAKENS the distinctions between the character classes , and for those hackers out there , it makes it impossible to have a `` maxed-out '' character.Sixth , there 's too much stuff ! I know I 've mentioned this before , but it 's just wrong that you could pick up every item in the whole game and still only see a tenth of all the different combinations of non-magical items.Seventh , there 's no more Apocalypse spell . Apocalypse was a cool spell that should not have been removed.D2 does have a few good ideas , though . Gems are very cool , but the fact that they come in five or six different quality levels , plus the fact that items can have widely varying numbers of sockets for them , only worsens the `` too much stuff '' problem . The Horadric Cube is an awesome idea , because it allows you to do really fun things . You put random things into it , and if you 're lucky , they 'll combine into something new ! You can take 3 gems of a given type and quality , and the Cube will compress them into one gem of the next highest quality . Combine 2 packs of crossbow bolts to get one pack of arrows , or 2 packs of arrows for one pack of bolts . No one but Blizzard knows all of the possibilities . I also love the addition of `` set '' items , or in other words , unique items that power each other up as you find more from each set . Unfortunately , it is , for all practical purposes , impossible to find all of the items in any one set , leading to hours upon hours of frustrated searching . Let 's see , I mentioned Gems , the Horadric Cube , set items ... were there any other positive additions to D2 ? I ca n't remember any more ... Diablo 2 can be fun and playable in its own way , but compared to Diablo 1 , it 's just horrible . There were too many bad ideas , and too many good ideas that were badly implemented . Do n't play this game unless you 've gotten bored with Diablo 1 .	-1
At first , I thought this game was good . The graphics are not very visually pleasing but the lighting affects were very nice . There were several different characters each with their own abilities and such . But with each waking moment I grew more and more bored , and my mouse grew more and more worn out as all I basically had to do was point at something and click like crazy till it was dead , not very entertaining . To add insult to injury , the monsters I was encountering were pretty much the same old beasts with a new outfit on , and maybe a different attack or special ability.Sure , there are tons of collectable items , and Blizzard claims that the items you wear change your appearance ( A half-truth as boots , gloves , and jewelry do not show up on your character ) . But you can only do the same thing over and over so much . The game 's & quot ; quests & quot ; from what I 've encountered are basically you go here , kill this boss and come back . Sure , there may be a few things you need to do , like a grab an item from point a , an item from point b , and put them in point c ; but the basic premise still stands.The game has it 's merits , they did spend a great deal of time making the full motion video cut scenes beautiful ( ala SquareSoft ) , and there are alot of items , and the areas are fairly sizable , and the load times are next to nil ( since the entire game is on your hard drive instead of on the cd like diablo 1 ) .The install process is slow and requires you to swap several disks including one with large movies on it ( you should have the option of not viewing movies in any game ) . But the uninstall takes mere seconds . Which leads me to believe the game does n't get fully uninstalled . I also hear the multiplayer is very fun ( which can make the worst games great ) .What honestly kills the game in my opinion ? The constant need to click the mouse in a rapid fasion ( the alternative is to hold the button down , which is just as bad ) , and the repetitiveness ( which is also a major flaw in Phantasy Star Online ) .If mindless clicking is your cup of tea , then by all means pick up a copy today . But otherwise save your cash .	-1
It IS point and click ! Yeah , the greatest RPG of all time ! It certainly makes you gain weight faster than any other RPG . All my friends have been fattened and dumbed by this marvel in brainwashing . They are all now one with the chair that they sit in . Greatest RPG ? Not even close . Those who say it is are probably physically dependant upon it by now . I observe people play with their eyes two inches from the monitor and their mouths slack with saliva dripping from the corners of their mouths . The only thing that moves is the hand , making quick , convulsive movements . I say that even if it does expand your brain ( Ha , ha ) , the other negative effects far outweigh the good .	-1
Besides having all the system requirements necessary and still not being able to run the game , my biggest problem with it is not being able to save the game state . This completely ruins it for me -- and probably for anyone else interested in the single-player aspect . It is truly awful to have to go back somewhere to get items that were perhaps left behind , only to have to fight everything that you already killed once all over again . Sadly , this ruins the game and storyline for me . I know other folks who are n't bothered by this at all , however . For me , though , it 's just a terrible way to have released the game . I honestly think that they should 've kept that save feature in the game , even if it meant releasing the game later .	-1
The game has many flaws in it making it almost unplayable . The most notable is the Anti-copy feature on the CD 's themselves making it impossible for some CD and DVD drives to read . At present Blizzard has no plans to fix this feature . Also the graphics and lag time in both online and single play are bad . In order to get the game to play you will need to tinker with the drivers and system options to get it to work . Reminds me of the old days of DOS where a Boot Disk had to be created to change your memory options . The box reports a minimum of 32Meg of memory , I would think it is closer to 64Meg . If your character incounters a large amount of monsters it will bog way down and the monsters will kill you before you get a hit in . If you must absolutely have the game I would wait a month for the problems to be fixed . There are already 2 patches in less then 2 weeks with number 3 in the works .	-1
This game would have been a MASTERPIECE , had it have not been for the stupidity of blizzard . This game WOULD be extremely fun , but there is one flaw , and this one flaw ruins how much I enjoyed the game : The damn saving option . This really pissed me off . After a hard 3 hours straight of battling , you find out you have to run off to work , so you save and quit the game . After a hard 8 hours of work , you look forward to playin the pretty fun game of Diablo 2 once again . you pop the Cd in the drive , start up the game ... .WHAT THE HELL ? ? I JUST BEAT ALL THESE ENEMIES ! yes that is right . After you save and quit , the enemies return . sure , its a good way to earn experience , but i think it goes a little too far when you have to defeat about 200 enemies and spend about an hour JUST to get back to where you left off on your last play . At first it 's not that bad , mainly because the enemies are not that hard , and there are not many of them . but once i got to the third act , i got so frustrated i just quit the game and didnt play it for a month . This gets so frustrating and time-consuming it is unreal.I loved the first Diablo , and right after i beat it i went out and bough diablo 2 with an expansion pack RIGHT AWAY , expecting this FANTASTIC game , and all i got was a 3 hour excitement from the first 2 acts . Now , i am going to auction it off of ebay as quick as possible , as the sight of the box i have reminds me of the mistake i made of spending a total of 40 dollars on such crap	-1
First things first . This game IS fun , and it got two stars for that only.Diablo 2 was fun for a while . Not a long while like Neverwinter Nights , but a little while . I did n't make it too far into the game because I lost track of the plot , and the game itself was far too repetitive . Every battle seemed to be the same , and it was all too easy . The battel system was just point and click , and there was no strategy to it at all . I know , this is just supposed to be a hack and slash , but it fails even at that.The graphics are moderately good , they are not bad but not real good either . The sound is good , probably one of the best parts of the game.If you want a hack and slash to be addicted to for less than a week , this is the way to go . You 'll be back . If you want a hack and slash to play for a while , may I reccomend any of the Icewind Dale 's . If you want a hack and slash with a real good plot , try Neverwinter Nights.I do reccomend this game , but do n't go wasting your money on it right now , wait until it is in the bargain bin , so 's you do n't get mad when you end up geting the game and becoming sick of it in three days .	-1
This is it ! Is this what the hype was all about ? Totally disappointed with this game . Again , a game that took 3 years to develop isnt a guarantee that it 'll be good ( Daikatana anyone ? ) . Diablo 2 is just all hot air . Lets start with the bugs . First of , let 's start with the technical goof ups . The game had problems with some CD drives . It takes me 3 to 5 tries just to have my Creative DVD recognize the CD . This is a major bug . Second , the CD had problems ejecting from my drive , thanks to the patch they released v.1.02 , it still didnt fix it . Thanks for nothing Blizzard . Third , the game wont run on my GeforceDDR under Direct 3D . So now , Im running the game using DirectDraw from my GeforceDDR . I ran the game using 3dfx glide and the graphics were so washed out and hazy . What do you expect from glide ? Now let 's go with the gameplay . It is absolutely similar with the first Diablo . Sure they upgraded the graphics and all , but gameplay is still the same old Diablo . The game comes in 3 CDs . The first CD will take you only about 4 hours to finish it because the monsters are just too dumb and too easy to beat . You 'll have the case of BOREDOM by the time you finish CD1 . As you progress deeper into the game , you start to realize that the challenge becomes more of simply just finishing it because you paid [ good money ] for it rather than seeing the end of the game . Motivation factor is zero . There were a lot of new items and weapons not found in the old Diablo but new items and new weapons just isnt enough to save this game . Maps are 3 times bigger than the old Diablo . Other than that , this game is just a waste of time because it runs and feels like the old Diablo which is already a tired old engine to spend your gaming hours on . I enjoyed playing Nox more than Diablo II . Newcomers in the Diablo world will feel just dandy with this game . Old Diablo players will go ho-hum with this one . My take on this game , wait for the retailers to put it on the bargain shelves .	-1
The only diabolical thing about this game is how bad it is . Blizzard 's strategy is this : make the game so much fun in the beginning that you sell lots o copies and than later it is no more fun . They make more money faster that way . But wasting money for this game which you will shelf after realizing there 's nothing more to do is a bad idea . Hack , slash , pick up , hack slash , level up , pick up , hack , slash , player killer , hack , slash , kill , level up . That 's how i can describe the game . Do yourself a favor , if you 're a hack and slasher buy a hack and slasher that is actual FUN and does n't try to be something it 's not . RPG fans should really turn away from this ... .	-1
Point , click , point , click , point , click . Need I say more ? Incase you missed that it was point , click , repeat . THIS GAME SUCKS ! I doubt the expansion will be any better . I guess if you are twelve and you get your rocks off by having super items and being able to kill anyone in the game then it 's sorta fun , but where 's the challenge ? It took me ten minutes to master this game ! I can not say enough bad things about this waste of money .	-1
It 's unfortunate that you have to buy these cards second hand now.Sony will do anything to make you buy newer versions of their PS-3.that have had constant complaints from customers.There are a lot of Very Good PS 1 GAMES OUT THERE , AND YOU CA N'T PLAY THEM WITHOUT THE MEMORY CARD.wEITE TO sony AND COMPLAIN .	-1
My best advise is to never buy a memory card online ! I could n't save at all with out it needing to be reformatted each time . I suggest not to buy memory cards online .	-1
NES is the best ever , SNES was great but N64 for me had no games that were nearly as memorible . I enjoyed Doom 64 , WCW/NWO games , MK Trilogy , Goldeneye , Banjo Kazooie and thats about it but again nothing really memorible . The grapics were new at the time but look like total garbage now and I have no desire to play the N64 but I still play NES to this day .	-1
When this thing was new it was certainly all the rage , but its main rival , the Sony Playstation was still a step ahead no matter Nintendo did . Nintendo releases games like Goldeneye and Starfox , two GREAT games , but then Square and Sony release Final Fantasy VII to america , which certainly changed things . On specifics , the N64 is 5 times more powerful than the playstation . But the N64 cartridges hold no where near as much space as the playstations black CDs . Why Nintendo did n't bother to use CDs as they originally planned confuses many to this date . CDs last longer , and in truth , are harder to damage . A bad drop on a tile floor may send fragments of plastic and silicon from your & quot ; F-Zero X & quot ; could be all over the kitchen floor . Nintendo did have one thing going for it over Playstation , remakes of classic games . With the 8bit Nintendo , they started some great games out . Then with the 16bit Super Nintendo , they made 16bit counterparts to the 8bit games . Now with this 64bit system , they made counterparts to the 16 bit games . This was their edge , and it made the system sell very well . In the long run was this systems downfall . Games are much harder to produce for N64 than they are playstation . Even though it it more powerful than the playstation , it is still second to it . What will happen soon , is anyone guess . Nintendo next year will release their new Gamecube . Gamecube does n't play DVDs like Sony 's Playstation 2 , and it does n't appear so far to be anymore powerful . Playstation 2 will be hard to beat for one , as you can see by it 's current demand . It seems that Nintendo has become the underdog , with giants such as Microsoft entering the race . Perhaps they 'll pull through , its unknown . Sega 's Dreamcast is certainly on it 's way down , it will not be possible to compete with the much more powerful Playstation 2 and Microsoft 's X-Box , and possibly the morepowerful gamecube . Word to the wise , if you 're planning to buy a top of the line system , I do not currently suggest this system . Dreamcast is a good bet for the buck , but waiting a while seems to be a wiser choice .	-1
Thanks to Nintendo 's bright idea to make a system and double the graphics from the 32-bit Sega Saturn and Playstation systems , we get stuck with one of the worst sytems out there . True Sega Saturn had lousy 3D graphics and bad third-party support , no one can deniy the fact it had some great games on it . And I hate Playstation , but because they shaped their graphics just right the games somehow came out looking better than N64 . Not only do we get a really cheesy system , they also had to turn many classic 2D games and turn them into horrible 3D games ( Like Earthworm Jim 3D , Zelda , Donkey Kong 64 , Kirby , Rayman 2 , and so much more ... ) ! Plus the controll drove me bonkers the way they controll it . Sometimes the controll 's bother me so much I have to stop playing the game . Plus because the games are in cartriges ( Lousy sound and space because of this ) they cost [ a lot ] and the games are usally short and do n't last more than a couple of hours before you 're finished with the game . And this is from someone who has loved all their other systems they made . Which is why I was crying after I played this thing ( I still think once was too painfull ) at a friends house . Complete waste of money . I do not recomend . Let 's hope the Nintendo Cube Box turns out better than this piece of trash .	-1
This is argubaly the worst system EVER . The music is horrible sounding comparing to the beauty of the playstation . There are no good RPG games for this system . The graphics in most games are nowhere near they could be and overall a pathetic system . The best game it had was Goldeneye 007 and in my mind that is the ONLY good game besides Perfect Dark to appear on the entire system during its 4 years on the American Market .	-1
I found this game to be just so so . With computer graphics you 'd think that they 'd be able to make the aliens more alien . They remind me of stormtroopers in black armour . I feel this game was limited to 1930 's stile imagination .	-1
As a Myst fan I looked forward to this game and was sure that since it was so difficult to find in my local store that it must have been great . Boy , was I wrong . I played through and found that the puzzles were pretty difficult simply because were totally unrelated to each other and the rest of the game in general . Running a PII 600 MHz machine the game gave me no problems and the graphics ran fine . I am not an extremely picky gamer and with a bit of a plot this game could have been tolerable . ... .	-1
After playing this game , I have yet to see any of the `` stunning 3D graphics and animation , '' as movement causes the graphics to merge with an extremely grainy texture . In fact , the landscapes were poorly rendered and did not impress me one bit . If this game was released about five or six years ago I might have been satisfied , but since then I 've seen and played a lot of games , both good and bad . Control is lousy because there are only a few selected paths on which you can travel . I should be thankful I only paid $ ... for this , otherwise I would be extremely unhappy . NOTE : The only reason I gave this game one star is because amazon would n't allow me to give it zero stars .	-1
I do like pastoral games , but this one was just a shade too soporific for me . I got about halfway through before I realized that I just did n't care if the aliens destroyed Earth or not . Bad sign !	-1
I was so disappointed in this game . It really had very little story line and the graphics were poorly done as well as the puzzles . I may have spent 3 hours on this game from start to finish and continued to be disappointed with the ending of the game . About all I can say about this game is that they tried ...	-1
I bought this when I was in my & quot ; Adventure & quot ; mode . Several other games earned my dollar , such as Lightbringer , Gabriel Knight 3 , Kings Quest 8 , etc . This one , however , was not really with the $ 19.95 I spent.The visuals are beautiful . The gameplay is too linear however . You have to & quot ; do this & quot ; before you can & quot ; do that. & quot ; There is no way to accomplish your goals in multiple ways . Whereas this concept was astonishing 3 years ago , it no longer appeals to the gamer.Another gripe : WAY TOO SHORT . If Al Gore had played and beaten this game , he would have demanded a recount and a re-recount . ( LOL ... oh , the political humor ! ) Buy this game only if you truly are a fan of mindless puzzles and rail gameplay . If you want a little more freedom in a game with a little more depth , story , character development and replay value , look elsewhere .	-1
Okay , maybe not . But it 's the second-worst I 've ever played , Entombed ( a $ 3 game so awful that Amazon does n't even have it ) having worse graphics and even more nonsensical puzzles.STORY : WEAKWho is Ozgar ? Who are the Arkonians ? Why do they hate each other ? Why does Ozgar hate you ? Is Ozgar really Darth Vader or does he just act like it ? These questions , alas , shall go unanswered . I do n't think I 'm willing to buy the second game to see if there 're any new revelations.Graphics : MediocreAm I unique in not liking when when the resolution is better during movement cutscenes than when you 're standing still ? I do n't think so . `` Wave that picture around , I need to get a good look at it . `` PUZZLES : What ? Much too simple and uninventive . What is all this stuff and what 's it for ? If I can figure out a code simply by trying random combinations , it 's too simple.ENDING : You get one screenshot . It does n't even move . That 's your reward for slogging through this awful game.REPLAY VALUE : Why ? If you 're really bored- and I mean REALLY bored - maybe you might see how fast you can run through it or something . But only if your friends are all sick , your internet connection is down and you 've played all the Minesweeper you can stand.VERDICT : STAY AWAY . STAY FAR AWAY . Play Myst . It 's better .	-1
Keeping in mind the age of the game , this was a decent , if somewhat frustrating outing for the adventure game genre . The game takes place in a BLADE-RUNNER inspired near future , which is evident by the flying cars and the dark metroplis in which it is set . The plot revolves around a terrorist group and a corporate conglomerate trying to harness a new invention that may very well turn into global mind-control . Your character has to figure out the truth of what is occurring and choose which side he is on.As I said , the look of the game is straight out of the BLADE RUNNER game from a few years previous . But the gameplay is much different - at its core , it 's still an adventure game . You collect items to be used on objects at later times , sometimes in combination with other items.We 've seen this variation more times than we can count , at this point - however , I have gotten used to the recent games and the innovations they have offered , so it was a bit of a shock to jump back 11 years to `` the way things used to be '' - by this I mean there were many unwelcome elements to the game that served to draw it out longer than it should have . Most notably , getting from one pre-rendered area to the next often meant having to sit still and wait while my guy walks from one side of the screen to the other.Furthermore , this being an event-triggering game means you may talk to one person , then talk to a few more and find yourself at a seeming dead end , because you do n't realize that the first character you talked to NOW has something new to say or offer based on events you 've triggered since talking to him . This backtracking stretches the game out longer than it should be.Also , in an attempt to add some depth , I guess , the game features ALOT of objects you can scan that end up being useless . This , however , causes you to miss some things along the way . I would search a cabinet and have the character tell me everything that was in there , and what objects he was taking . Later , I 'd search a shelf and be told `` NOTHING OF INTEREST . '' And yet sitting ON that shelf was the very object I needed , I just had to see it and click on it separately - this feels like a bit of a cheap trick ! What 's even more irritating is the attitude and voice acting of the main character . I think they were going for a film noir style , but half the time , clicking on something useless would result in him simply saying `` NAAAAAHHHH ! '' At other times , though , you would n't even get that , but a simply shrug of the shoulders as if to say , `` what do you want me to do about it ! ? '' I do n't know why , but I found this `` attitude '' to be supremely annoying ! The story was par for the course for an adventure game . Predictable , entertaining enough but certainly not worthy of a film or book adaptation.Graphically , the game was pretty good considering its age . Once again , think BLADE RUNNER style drab and dark . It certainly is n't pretty , by any stretch - but it has a consistent style appropriate to the story.If you find it cheap at Half-Price Books as I did , you 'll make an enjoyable weekend distraction of it - but I would n't go out of my way to add it to your collection .	-1
Rayman 2 requires a more sophisticated video card than my year old computer has , ( although I 've never had problems with any other program ) but when I e-mailed the technical support address several times to try to work out the problem , I received no response . My stepdaughter tried to get it to run on her even newer computer , but found it froze up every time . Disappointed and dissatisfied .	-1
Now let me tell you straight that Rayman is one of the best games I have ever played ! With wonderous worlds , challenging levels , and memorable charicters make it a game to be hold ! That where Rayman 2 comes in . Gone are all the great stuff I mentioned above , clearly a fatele mistake on Ubi Soft 's part . We have none of the returning cast ( Except for Rayman of course ) , choppy 3D graphics ( A lot of the graphics look like they were painted on the game ) , and very little challenge makes this a tradgity ! I 've had this game for little over three days and have unlocked all the secrets AND beat the game ! ! ! The first had me playing for months . And when I was finished with it I shed a tear of joy and said : & quot ; Now THAT was a game ! & quot ; I 'm still wondering how this can be called a sequal , it 's terrible ! I 'm truly offended by this game ! All those who praise this game have probibly never played the first game ! I beg of all those who read this reveiw , please play the first game first to see what Rayman truly has to offer you ! This game is just a wasted game . I hope Ubi Soft wises up with Rayman 3 or I 'll just have to shelf the game as & quot ; A game that got killed , when turned to 3D. & quot ; Boo , hoo ! ! !	-1
First let me start by saying I have nothing against this game . It is a classic and I recommend it to anyone who loves video games . I gave it one star because of the computer compatibility.If you have anything above Windows ME or maybe even XP , do NOT buy this game . It will not even start on your computer . If you want to play Rayman 2 , go to GOG.com and buy it for a few bucks . They make their games compatible with newer operating systems .	-1
Get it through your head THIS GAME stinks First of all the graphics suck , boring gameplay ( I usually like realistic military games ) , coud n't acess campaign , takes forever to install.I would give this game 0 stars . I just bought it about 1 hour ago played it for 15 min . and then got bored ... Try the Unreal series , half life or rainbow 6	-1
It seems that most of the people who played this game liked it . And I must say that when I got it , I was expecting a better experience than I got , something along the lines of Rainbow Six with more running and shooting . However , as opposed to most of the reviews I saw , Delta Force was a huge dissapointment . With horrible graphics ( Maybe it 's my computer , but they did n't even have a strafing animation or realistic grass ) and stupid extras as weapons ( see the pathetic explosion from a strike ) the game was a massive waste of money . I 'm beginning to think that everone likes it because it 's so cheap .	-1
Okay . Some people ( Like 10 and 12 year olds ) think this game is sooo cool . This game so very unrealitic . Infact , everything about this game is stupid . The weapons are okay , but when you fire , there is no recoil that makes you reticule ( The cross thingy that helps you aim ) go up and down . Also , 1 shot from any gun kills an enemy ( Which is pathetic ) so why put your M4A1 rifle on burst ? Just use single shot to conserve ammo . The games graffics are as [ bad ] and the screams that the enemies make when you shoot them are corny and cartoony . I suggest that you do not buy this game because of the reasons listed above . Please , save your money and buy a better game like Counter-Strike ( The best game ever made ) Half-Life ( The second best ) or Rainbow Six : Raven Shield ( The third best ) If you are looking for realism , DO NOT look here at this game . Its pathetic .	-1
I bought this game at a fairly low price , and when I started playing , I was totally amazed - at the incredibly bad graphics.The game featured a basic HUD with two annoyingly large bars , placed above and below it . That was the first thing I noticed . Next I saw that the terrain was sort of fuzzy , and my gun was n't all that impressive either. & quot ; OK ... , & quot ; I said to myself . & quot ; Why do n't I try walking around and see if this gets any better ? & quot ; So I did . Guess what ? No gun sway ! Every stinkin FPS game I 've every seen had some sort of movement with the gun ( Ok , maybe not Wolfenstein 3d , but still ! ) .So , anyway , I tried firing the gun - barely any recoil at all . I tried a pistol just to see if the hammer would pull back but it did not.Anywayz terrible graphics = boring game . Enough said	-1
I own this game . I have gotten a 5 star rating once but it is dumb because if you run out of money and go into debt you ca n't get your money back or build anything . The people get impatient and stressed out and then they start taking your money away . I would recommend that you buy Spider Man or the Spider Man Movie Game instead of this annoying game that never ends .	-1
Sim Copter is a quite old game ( 1997 ) . The idea is that you start out with A helicopter and some money , you need too complete missions to earn more to buy new copters , and accesories . After you 've completed all the missions you move on to the next city with tougher missions ( and more money ) . The gameplay is OK but the controls aer'nt very realistic . The graphics are horrific the cars , sims , and some buildings arent even textured . The music and the sound effects are lacking and there 's no ambiant sound . You can upload SimCity 2000 cities and play in them but its useless with SimCity 3000 . The game does have quite A few bugs , sims can get stuck , your pilot can get stuck too and if you do it right your pilot can jump out right as your taking off and your copter will crash . Overall this game is OK but maxis ought to remake it with better graphics , less bugs , more levels and stuff to buy , and to work with SimCity 3000 cities . But you still should'nt get it there 's just to many problems .	-1
They make a game that surpasses the power of most if not all computers of 1999 ( the year it was made ) and probably for many years to come . Like Wing Commander III it was Unplayable when it was out and it is now ... But for different reasons . Yeah , in a couple of years you 'll have that nice P9 /9 ghz with a Voodoo 7/75000 and whatever but will your operating system be compatible ? No . These showy graphics games like this are useless . No computer can run them . Not now . Not ever . If I had a super-duper Voodoo 7/7500 ect . I could probably give you an acurate review . Who has that ? ( with windows 98 ) . As for graphics they are excellent , stupendous , never seen anything like them ; but since they are like a slide show I just see them as adequete . I imagine butterflys and what not flying gracefully and that would be & quot ; stupendous & quot ; but it 's just stupid on my machine . The acting is not as bad as people make it out to be ... It is ... Well.. Adequate ... For a game . Not as bad as Animae cartoons ... Almost not . Dungeons are fun and beautiful but are like tome raider ( a lot of people say that and now so do I ) . It 's pretty though and has dialogue . Raven 's fun . Get Redguard ( not at-all bad acting ) or Tomb raider they will surely work on most computers . The only difference is this one does not .	-1
Looking past the buggy engine and gameplay , the game is incredibly inconstant with previous Ultima games AND itself . The Avatar has to has ... What a paladin is ... this is just EA squeezing the last bit of promise from this game ... .One of the Avatar 's Companions , Sir Dupre ... for 4 games ... Was a Paladin , and he sacrificed himself in the Stead of the Avatar in Ultima 7 . That one line of Dialog killed the game for me.Do n't waste your money and get one of the Better Ultima games .	-1
I bought this with the hopes of a fun , addictive and diverse roleplaying game . Unfortunatly that did n't exactly turn out to be the case . The only way I see fit to best describe this game is by listing the pros and cons.PROS:1 . AMAZING graphics , makes you really feel like your in an actual world.2 . NPC 's have sets of speech that actual actors speak.3 . Easy to play4 . Fully Useable Terrain , climb mountains , swim , get lost in the forest.5 . Day and Night Cycles and RainstormsCONS:1 . Huge Requirements , This required ( s ) a beastly system to play on otherwise it 's really choppy or in some cases does n't even work.2 . BUGGY , There is tons of bugs that managed to make it on here that can make you very frusterated while playing.3 . The main quest is almost always boring ! Even worse most of the side quests pertain directly to the main quest . This makes almost everything seemed forced . When your doing something , your doing it because according to the quest your on you have to.4 . Combat is also very boring , Archer , Staff fighter , Swordsman , its all the same ( just run up to what your fighting and click away BORING ) 5 . There is no & quot ; working up skills & quot ; The only advances your character gets are from completing part of the quest . ONCE AGAIN VERY FORCED PLAYSTYLE.6 . Sure the magic spells are neat , but most of them are useless . ( I easily got through the whole game using minor heal and fireball ) 7 . The game is often to challenging to be fun , I cant count how many times I absolutly HAD to refer to a walkthrough because I was stuck . Most of the time the solution to being stuck was something i truely would have never found without looking at the guide.8 . Dungeons are almost all based on puzzles , Sure the puzzles were cool but with the exception of a few rats you might have to kill here and there the puzzles are all you do ! BORING9 . Your Virture you get in the beggining of the game had nothing to do with anything ! It may say you start on the path of a druid , but all that actually means is you will start with different equipment than that of a shepard . ( I was a tinker , { did hat i start with have anything to do with a tinker NO } ) 10 . I thought the ending was terrible , I played the game for about 80 playing hours for this ! 11.. I Save the worst for last . ITS QUITE EASY TO SCREW THE GAME OVER . You have to do the quest exactly as your told or you can screw up the game and have to reload ( this should never happen in a game . ) In worst cases you may be following the quest and do something wrong withen it which causes the game to screw up . I vividly remember having to reload way back in time because i did the Sacrifice quest before the Justice quest , even though the option to do the Sacrifice quest was given to me , The game apparently wanted me to do the Jusstice quest first.If you want a good roleplaying game I really would n't recommend this . This game was hardly diverse , boring and virtually everything you did in it was forced .	-1
It is really a shame that this game was never updated for windows XP . You can run most of the features , but the practice shooting range no longer works and this is an important feature . You need to practice to do well in solving the puzzles . I wrote to them a while back but they showed no interest in providing a fix . I guess they made their money and do n't care .	-1
Yet another in the turgid 'Wing Commander ' series , 'Prophecy'thankfully reduces the amount of dull , plotless FMV , whilst notsignificantly improving the gameplay , which does n't seem to have evolved very much since the original 'Wing Commander ' . Your ship still does n't 'feel ' as if it is flying through space , the supposedly-invincible bad guys are more of a nuisance than a threat , and if you fail a mission it will probably be because you failed to protect something that you were not told about.Imagine watching a bad , low-budget science fiction film whilst playing a modern homage to 'Star Raiders ' and you have the game in a nutshell . END	-1
I would have love to play this game but it would not work for windows 8 and windows Xp or windows 98 It is new and the intro before the selecting a new game works but when I get into a new game it keeps giving me an error that wo n't allow me to get in it keeps giving me an error so I keep closing the program if there is a patch that would resolve the problem great otherwise than that I would never play the game again the box looks great and the manual as well looks great thanks	-1
The controls are hard to use , it 's almost imposible to order your units to attack enemy units because they move to fast . The 3D graphics are terrible and the sound is mediocre . The game says you can play multiplayer on 56K or better but you realy need DSL or something . The so called tricorder is imposible to use . The missions are way to hard and you can only save at the end of your mission so you'le end up playing for hours trying to finish . If you want good 3D strategy dont look here .	-1
Star Trek New Worlds gave us the promise of & quot ; Starcraft meets Star Trek. & quot ; When starting the game , you believe you are going to get this , but then things go wrong ... very wrong.First of all , there does n't seem to be any logical method to what you need to build . Sure , you need power and mining , but every other required building 's function seems to be very vague.Next , the missions seem very difficult to complete . You build the required buildings and go on the missions , but it sometimes takes up to an hour to really get going.All of this is made even more frustrating because of a lack of a Save Game feature . If this game had one , it would make it so much better . You play for an hour or so and then loose . It is a horrible experience.The most positive aspects of the game lie in the story and graphics . The opening movie and continuing story are excellent and very much in the spirit of & quot ; Star Trek. & quot ; The graphics are also top notch and are really detailed.Overall , I can not recommend this game . If it had a save game feature , you could overlook the other flaws and have a good time .	-1
I guess I 'll never learn about the latest incarnation of & quot ; Star Trek & quot ; games . I had earlier complained about & quot ; Klingon Academy & quot ; , and now it 's time to complain about his game . It was great at first , with the graphics and all , but now that I 've had it for a while , it just about stinks . It took me forever just to complete the first mission . I 've been on the second forever ! I 've managed to build the colony , mine the dilithium required , but I can never find that archeological area you 're supposed to run science scans on . They need a strategy book for this game . It 's just too hard to understand .	-1
My God , if this is a game , it needs to be called Destruction Derby because of all the crashes . My computer is WAAAAAAAAY above minimun specs for this game , and I experience crash after crash . The fact that there is no in game save option really [ stinks ] also because you have to start the mission over after your game crashes . The only reason this game got a star was because the graphics and movies are cool , but as far as game play and interface ... . it [ stinks ] . The game is n't hard , it 's just time consuming , and gets really frustrating when you have to restart you computer every half an hour or so because of the crashes . Do n't ask interplay if you there will be a patch out soon either , they wo n't respond , lately they have just been shoving games out on the market half finished and then not providing help to the customers who bought the games . I know I 'm not the only person experiencing these problems because I bought the game with three other people and they have them also , and feel the same as I do . Quite frankly this is the last game I will ever purchase from them .	-1
As I 'm unable to `` fully '' review this game , let me just say , the game is not compatible with WIN XP . If you are lucky ( or foolish ) enough to still be running Win 98 , then you may be able to get the game to load .	-1
I really want to know who it is out there who seems to think that because you slap a recognizable name like Star Trek on a product and sell it is all one has to do . I also want to know how it is that two completely separate game companies , Interplay and Activision , can produce two separate games ( Starfleet Command and Star Trek : Armada ) that work almost the same and reek of the same shoddy workmanship . It is products like these that make me realize why I have abandoned Star Trek fandom in the first place . Because like Deep Space Nine and Voyager , they are so lacking in the creativity that made the franchise so worthwhile in the first place.Starfleet Command-a space combat game by Interplay ( Quicksilver ) , is so bereft intuitive control that it becomes a laborious task to make any ship you control do anything useful . Case in point , in my first mission with my frigate sent after Orion pirates , it took me 15 minutes just to hammer down the enemy ship 's shields and constantly fiddling with my ship 's weapons systems just to get it to fire at the Orion . Of course while all this is going on my frigate is endless rotating and turning all over the map . Why should it be harder to NOT do something than it is to do something . At least in Armada you can simply drag-and-select your ship ( s ) and click elsewhere on the map to get them to go there . In Starfleet Command , it takes so long to get your ship to do anything that I was given to wonder why I had to select crew members for my new ship in the first place.And why , in the year 2000 , with all the great computer games out there and the high level of coding in those games , are we still playing so-called 3D space combat games in 2 dimensions ? I do not care if they is based on the Starfleet Battles board game , I played that to and realized that it was limitation with it as well . Why is it so hard to work in the 3rd dimension and enable the player to go ` Up ' or ` Down ' ? We live in a 3 dimensional world and as Homeworld proved , it 's easy to control , because the programmers made an interface that was simple and intuitive as well as functional . I am also given to wonder why people are not more critical about products like this when they are so inferior when compared to similar programs . If you comparison shop for a car , why would n't you do the same for a piece of software . It is n't like Starfleet Command is the only one of its kind . It is your money afterall.Just because it has ` Star Trek ' tacked on to it does not automatically make it good : Remember Star Trek Voyager ? Maybe my standards are too high or maybe I should n't feel ripped off for spending $ ... and having the pervasive sense of not getting my money 's worth .	-1
The problem with Star Trek games is that they try to be too much like Star Trek . Sound confusing ? It is . To break the mold , Star Trek producers are going to have to lean on other designs because the way they make their games now just is n't getting it done . I mean , how can one series of games , with all the countless titles , all be so mind-numbingly below average games ? The problem with Starfleet Command is ambition . The game boasts true 3-D combat . This is n't true in the slightest . If you want 3-D space combat , go buy Homeworld . Starfleet command is on two axi , the X and Y . No mention whatsoever of the Z axis . Everything is played on a flat plane . Now , I 'm no expert of space travel , but this just is n't accurate , nor does it make for an enjoyable experience.Do n't expect to use your torpedoes with this game either . They miss almost every time you launch them . And it is n't because of anything you 're doing wrong : they just miss . The game is also very hard to figure out in its ship setup stage . If you want to load certain shuttles on your ship , you actually have to tell the game to NOT load them to get them to be there . It is backwards thinking , and I can not believe that they shipped the game with errors in the interface like this.Overall , it is n't terribly bad , but is not very good either . It is better than 2 stars but not quite at 3 stars either . I 'd rate it 50 % . It has some nice features , such as being able to command a starship and be in charge of every feature of that ship , but you soon find that , with the absense of hotkeys for most parts of the ship , this game turns into a micromanagement simulation when you do n't have time to micromanage because you 're being shot at . The AI is generally dumb in the game when they are isolated , but some missions can be near impossible , and combine that with the fact that your & quot ; wingmen & quot ; do not do anything helpful , it can be very frustrating when trying to destroy over 30 Orion Pirate ships in one certain Federation mission . That 's just it : some missions are impossible to beat , and the strategy guide does not help in the slightest.To make a long story short , I played this game for about 10 days , then uninstalled it on my hard drive and sold it in an online auction . The game just does not deliver what it should for what a starship combat simulation should .	-1
This game is so boring , I never finished it . For one , you ca n't die , you just resurrect , so why even care if you get killed . Also , you can get lost and never finish a mission and not care because even if you do , nothing happens . You do n't build up armor or weapons and who cares any ways because , oh right , you ca n't die . You also ca n't build up a hunting party and people you meet have no real purpose because you can go anywhere . I never figured out the importance of any of the story line .	-1
I 'm giving 1 star because this is one of the cheapest packages I have ever bought , it looks like a pirated copy ! No , wait , a pirated copy would look better ! ! All the disks came in a single case , onve over the other ( which caused scratches in almost all of them ) , Oh and all the cool covers on the disks ? horrible black and white labels ! I regret buying this !	-1
I really had my heart set on Toy Commander and when I got it , the game just did n't deliver ! The game concept is really cool on paper but it did n't translate into a good game . The jerky camera which comes as a result of the poor vehicle control actually makes me sick everytime I play it ! Control is so important in any 3D game and this game just lacking , big time ! The multi player mode is also disappointing as the small vehicles get lost among the colourful stages . The game is just not fun ! The graphics and the sounds are great but the game is just lacking in the fun department.I 'm sorry people but the bottom line is that you can pass on this game and be quite contented because you saved a couple of bucks .	-1
& quot ; De plane ! De plane ! It 's stuttering ! De plane ! & quot ; First of let me say that you need a computer the size of the Empire state building to run this game . I got a PIII 800 with a GeForce 256 card and a 256 memory and this game tore it to shreds in a matter of minutes . This made me think again about upgrading my system . As long as you fly straight it 's ok ; that is if you want to fly to the North pole or the South pole everytime you boot up this game . But once you turn the aircraft , you 'll experience graphics turbulence . You 'll feel your computer shudder and shake as it battles it 's way to redraw the scenery . You 'll see your frames slow down really bad . Lower the graphics settings ? Try it and you 'll just make this game laugh in your face . Download the patch ? Yes , I did and it was still stuttering . You can make every upgrade you want on your computer but if the game is the problem then it 's a lost cause . If you 're thinking about picking up this game , make sure you have a powerful computer that runs on nuclear energy . Like most other Microsoft Flight Sims , this one is geared more towards the gamer side and not so much on the real simulator enthusiasts . The planes are just too easy to fly . You could ask your kid brother to do the take-off procedure . Realism is not that all real as the game boasts itself to be . The game does have its own pluses though like a huge database of airports , downloadable Jeppesen weather reports , and of course there 's a lot of third party support on this . If you 're a gamer who wants to try flight sims then pick this game up . If you 're a simulator , then pick up something else like Fly 2K ! ( very realistic ) or Aerowinx 744 ( very very realistic ) .	-1
I 've played almost every flight sim available today , and some that are so old that they have n't been available in years . I have hoped and waited for Microsoft to release a Flight Simulator program that not only gets the flight dynamics of a real plane correct , but also gets the graphics up to par with some of the other less realistic simulators ( combat sims mostly ) . Flight Simulator 2000 disappoints again . I am running a very high end system with a very powerful video card and the graphics on this game still are bad . When you look out of the sides of the airplane ( left , right , back , etc ) the program requires 'loading time ' in order to render the cockpit art . Totally unacceptable in my book . No amount of settings adjusting could correct this on my computer.If the largest software company in the world is going to release a program , and charge 50 bucks a pop for it , I think that the graphics should not only be adequate but should absolutely kick some behind ! Flight Simulator is a serious disappointment in that department.The dynamics are interesting . I guess if all you want to do is look straight ahead and instrument fly you are in luck here because the dynamics seem to be fairly realistic . The adjustable difficulty settings are nice and the variety of airports to take off and land on are a nice feature as well ( though there is n't much difference between runways as far as particular problems in approach are concerned , because the MS flight sim world is COMPLETELY FLAT ) .Poor showing Microsoft . Hire some coders who can make the artwork something other than ameturish and you may just have something . Look to some of your competitors work for an example , or take a ride in a real plane and make an attempt to recreate not only the way it handles , but how the world really looks and what it is like to turn your head around in a cockpit . I guarantee it is nothing like FS 2000 .	-1
This is just like Starcraft except it 's not nearly as good ... .if you like Starcraft this is a big dissapointment compared to it .	-1
The first Age of Empires was great . The second one just plain sucked . Sure it has good graphics and an easy to use interface , but the game would always crash both of my computers . You can only play in 800x600 or above which is a downside also . My computers are not old either , one is a 300p-2 160megs ram 17 inch monitor , voodoo3 etc . The other is a 450 amd k6-2 96 megs ram , Ati graphics , 15 inch monitor . I just wanted to put this warning out to those who will be purchasing it . It may work fine for you , but I had problems . It sure is not addictive as the first AOE . Buggy software ! Blahh ! I am not anti Microsoft by the way .	-1
Asheron 's Call is a basic RPG played online . You create your character from three different races of humans ( basically English , Arabian or Japanese ) and then assign skills and stats to customize your character . And then you 're launched into the world of Asheron 's Call.The first thing that strikes you is the scale of the game . It 's huge . The second thing is the unavoidable question : What do I do know ? Now here 's what I did : After entering the game I wandered around for an hour or two trying to make scense of it all . I was then asked by another player if I wanted to swear allegiance to him ( which meant that he would be my patron and help me get started with my char. ) . So I then followed my patron around for a few hours and did what he told me to do . I killed a lot of monsters and was given a lot of equipment . This quickly became boring and I quit playing and traded the game in at my local games store for a copy of & quot ; Sacrifice & quot ; ( which was much more exciting ) .The main problem with an online RPG is , in my opinion , the lack of meaning or a goal . At least in the beginning . You just wander around and kill things . There 's no quests . There 's no nothing . Just wandering around in this huge ( note : to get an idea of how huge it really is , read Douglas Adam 's description of infinity in & quot ; The Hitchiker 's Guide To The Galaxy & quot ; ) world . Another things that really bothers me , is the fact that you have to pay a monthly fee ( $ ... in this case ) to play a game you initially paid a fair sum of money for ( in my case , $ ... ) . Why is this ? I 'm sure there are some expences in keeping the servers going , but not $ ... a month for each player . On Microsoft 's webpages , it said that there were over 200k people playing the game . Multiply that number by $ ... and you get the staggering amount of $ ... a month ( no way it costs that much to maintain the servers ) . Capitalism rules , I guess .	-1
Okay , here it is in a nutshell . The graphics bite , and bite HARD . The spell component system is so difficult that playing hack and slash by default is much more preferable . And there is little if any help by the GMs . My two cents . Buy at your own risk .	-1
Even though this game has a HUGE map , great graphics , and everything you need to make the perfect RPG , it still stinks . I know this may sound crazy but it really isint . The main problem is combat . You select where you want to attack ( high , medium , or low ) and the computer does the rest . Also you have to pay 10.00 a month to play it . There are many other reasons why this game is absolutely no fun to play but trust me it is no fun at all . Remember , great graphics does not make a game , gameplay does .	-1

This game should have NEVER been released in its current state . Its load times are unacceptable . Both games feel like chores playing because of how long everything takes due to very poor emulation . Squaresoft wanted to make as much money as they could with the game without having to spend any money to hire someone who could make the game work properly with the PS1 . This is an extremely bad port of FF5 and FF6 . FF5 freezes very often when you try to save . Also its load times are long . Not to mention this is the original translation of the game , so be prepared to have a certain character talk like a drunken brain damaged pirate the entire game . FF5 just butchers the English language . FF6 is the same as it was on SNES except for extremely long load times . It becomes a chore trying to open the menu to heal your character or whatever . The long load times really take away from the games and just makes the whole thing a bad experience . Stick to the SNES or get these games on gameboy advance . Also FF5 is exactly the same on PSN as it was in anthology . LONG LONG load times as well as being incompatible with your PS3 half the time . Shame on you square soft , shame .	-1
Well if it is anything like FF2 , I might not play them , I liked FF1 and FF2 but they are too simple for me to finsih	-1
I do n't like this game . It is terrible . Terrible graphics and the fact that you ca n't use the joystick makes it harder to play . This is the worst james bond game I 've ever played . I 'm returning it .	-1
When I was taking this game to the checkout line I anticipated a great classic on par with F Zero X but what I got was a complete waste of money.Talk about a disaster this game was just like one huge train wreck.Not fun at all and the graphics are some of the ugliest most bland landscapes Ive ever seen.This game is an insult to the N64.Instead get Ocarina Of Time , Perfect Dark , Super Smash Bros or F Zero X.Pass on this .	-1
I picked this up for free pretty much , I didnt know what to expect . I liked the PC and GBC versions , but this one has gone a completly different way . It only has one veiw , from behind . It would have been so much better to have a top view ( sky cam ) or veiw from the side like in Hot Wheels Stunt Something that are on GB and PC and probably every other platform . The one veiw is just no good.It 's not at all hard to play . But it 's got no real challenge to it , the graphics may be better then the side angled other version of Hot Wheels games , but this one being from behind and all , it is not as much fun.This game would be great for kids under 13 , especiely under 6.. the controls are ok I guess , the graphics arnt so bad but could have been a lot better , the commentry is annoying till you turn it down.Buy it for the kids maybe , but anyone into a real race game will find it 's lack of reply value disapointing .	-1
I think that the review at the top of this game has it right -- not enough questions . Also , the $ 100 through $ 1000 questions are too hard ( compared to the TV show ) .Another annoying feature is the inability to skip past stuff that you have seen a million times , that is redundant to you.I bought this game out of boredom , and I think that I paid about $ ... for it . If you like the TV show , then do n't pay any more than that . But , if you see it on the rack real cheap , then hey , pick it up .	-1
Would have a good review if the developers spent more than five minutes slapping this together . By the second or third time through the questions were already repeating themselves - awful ! Plus multiplayer is just a & quot ; fastest-finger & quot ; question to determine who plays solo . Big deal ! The worst part is the game only runs about two or three times before it crashes on startup . This is on an Intel PC with name-brand components , no cheap swap-meet stuff . The only solution has been to uninstall and reinstall the game . A visit to the Disney Interactive site for tech support ... umm where is it ? Because of this I ca n't recommend anyone purchase this game.They 've come out with a second edition of this game ( wow , so quick ? ) Perhaps this version works ?	-1
When Millionaire first was on in the summer of 1999 , I was thoroughly addicted . This was novel , new television . Now , of course , it 's repetitive and boring , but for a while there was really a spark there.The computer game , however , always ... . It hogged memory , was hard to control , and was n't very much fun . It 's sad , but the online free version at ABC.com was a lot more fun . I generally do n't like games where there 's no flexibility and very little fun , so if you 're like me ( and I would hope so ! ) , avoid this one !	-1
Holy fat mama ! This game was the most hideous thing I have ever played . Not only is it easier than the TV show , its twice as dumb ! The first and second questions I was asked the first time I played were the same stinkin ' question . From the third game on , I never went without a repeat question . You should stay away from this . It will probably eventually drive you insane by the low-fi sound clip of Regis saying & quot ; Final Answer ? & quot ; anyways . Try some of the not-as-pathetic games by eXpert software . Such as extreme paintball , deer hunter , and other quickly thrown together titles . It gets a second star for being functional ( barely )	-1
Man , I never knew Phil Regis could be this ANNOYING ! Since some of the first few questions are ludicrously hard ( which is totally unlike the show ) , and it gives you 30 seconds to answer the question ( which is ALSO totally unlike the show ) , I have to restart the game A LOT , which means I hear Phil Regis A LOT . A & quot ; skip & quot ; button should 've been put into the game ! I have n't recieved any repeat questions after about 3 months of owning the game . How ? I uninstalled it after 30 minutes and never played it again ! Trust me , you 'd get more fun out of an electronic whoopee cushion than this game ... and it 's $ 5 cheaper !	-1
I am 15 years old . This is my first review ( out of about 30 ) that is a 1-star review . And I have 18 ( give or take a few ) reasons why I hate this game so much:1 . After the first game , the questions started repeating . The game is basically the same 40 questions over and over again.2 . You ca n't skip the introduction . I know it 's not too long , but you 'd think that with today 's technology there 'd be an option to skip it.3 . Regis is appallingly rude . Once I won nothing and he said , & quot ; Welll , there you go . Do n't spend it all in one place . In fact , do n't spend it at all . Put it in the bank ! In 40 years , maybe you 'll be able to afford a marble or something ! & quot ; 4 . Once a $ 200 question appeared later as a $ 32,000 question . Um , that 's not good.5 . The questions from $ 100 to $ 1,000 are too difficult ( compared to the show ) . For example , the show had a $ 1,000 question that was & quot ; How many legs does a spider have ? & quot ; But the game had a $ 1,000 question that was & quot ; What kind of object is a 'ginsu ' ? & quot ; 6 . Once again , Regis is appallingly rude . Once I won $ 1,000 and he said , & quot ; Not bad , But at least you should 've known the last one . Come on ! Or at least you should 've GUESSED better ! & quot ; 7 . Regis only says & quot ; Is that your final answer ? & quot ; whenever he wants to . Most of the time , your first answer IS your final answer , even if you happened to hit the wrong button by mistake.8 . There 's a ridiculous time limit of 30 seconds per question . I 've seen people on the show take as long as 17 minutes.9 . The Fastest Finger mode is a joke . You 're supposed to hit a letter key when you think the four answers are in the correct sequence . You do n't actually put them in order.10 . Regis is appallingly impatient . If you take too long on certain things ( like the Fastest Finger mode , or saying how many contestants will play ) , he 'll say , & quot ; This game is over ! I 'm outta here ! & quot ; , and the game quits on you . Yep , you 're back to Windows ! And guess what ? Once you load it back up again ... ..11 . ... ... you 'll have to sit through the introduction again ! 12 . There 's a general lack of options . When you hit the Escape key , you bring up the option menu , and you have these options : Volume Up , Volume Down , Resume , Start Over , Quit . There 's no way to make the questions easier or harder , and there 's no way to skip the introduction.13 . Speaking of which , when you select Start Over , the whole program starts over . Yep , you 'll have to sit through the introduction again ! 14 . Once again , Regis is appallingly impatient . If you take too long to write your name , Regis will say , & quot ; Come on , it 's not a big deal & quot ; , or & quot ; This is n't a trick question , what 's your name ? & quot ; If you take too long , he 'll type whatever he wants ( e.g . Kathie Lee Gifford ) .15 . When you use the Phone-a-Friend Lifeline , Regis calls one of HIS friends and they start chatting a little before they get to the question . Then he 'll say to his friend , & quot ; I 've got a question for you & quot ; , as if you 're not even there . I mean , come on , it 's YOUR lifeline , not Regis 's ! 16 . What 's wrong with having an option to use the mouse ? 17 . When you say & quot ; yes & quot ; to the instructions , Regis only gives them to you once . This is especially annoying in the Fastest Finger mode , in which you 're pretty much doomed to load the game up again once it quits.18 . Did I mention that Regis is appallingly rude and impatient ? Well , there you have it . This review pretty much goes to ALL the games in this series ( 19 . The makers were kind enough to make more than one edition of this trash ) . One of the few redeeming qualities of this game is the CD has pretty art on one side . That way , the CD makes a colorful , if fragile Frisbee . Aside from & quot ; Treasure Mathstorm ! & quot ; and all the other & quot ; games & quot ; in that series , this is the lamest excuse for a game I have ever played . And that is my final answer !	-1
As a big fan of the TV show , I was really looking forward to the home version , and undoubtedly so were thousands of other fans . Unfortunately , the folks at Disney and Jellyvision were clearly aware of that , and the rush was obviously on to get this game to market as soon as possible , before the craze could die down . The result is a game that does n't come close to matching either the TV show or Jellyvision 's previous efforts.The most obvious problem is the limited number of questions . This problem is greatly compounded by the fact that the game does n't seem to make note of which questions have already been asked -- a simply inexcusable error , which results in repeated questions after only a few games.The box proudly touts the fact that a & quot ; virtual Regis & quot ; hosts the game ; and sure enough , he 's there . But his involvement in the project was clearly limited ; he does n't read any of the questions , only providing the pre- and post-question patter . That 's understandable , given the amount of money that Regis would have probably demanded for such a large recording job ; but it does greatly diminish the illusion of being on the show.The game 's incorrect pacing destroys the rest of that illusion . Instead of encouraging the player to take his/her time as the show does , a 30-second clock is inexplicably added . And while the game rushes you through the questions themselves , it needlessly slows down between them . Since the designers could n't have Regis read the questions , they clearly wanted to maximize his involvement between questions ; so the game stops after every question while Regis delivers one of a set of long canned remarks . This is tolerable later in the game , but it comes across as simply silly during the first few easy questions that the TV show would blast through in short order.As others have pointed out , even the keyboard commands have problems . Assigning a lifeline to the same key as an answer choice is begging for mistakes ; and the lack of an & quot ; Is that your final answer ? & quot ; question in most cases further increases the possibility of errors , as well as erasing the remainder of the feel of being on the show.The game does have its moments ; if multiple people are playing , a clever implementation of the fastest-finger round decides who gets to sit in the hot seat . But frankly , I ca n't imagine playing this as a multi-player game anyway ; the show 's format simply is n't suited to be a party game , and this home version simply is n't exciting enough to watch.In summary , the Millionaire computer game has its ( brief ) moments , but simply is n't worth even the low price Disney is asking for it . It 's unfortunate that Disney and Jellyvision chose to put their names -- and the show 's reputation -- on such a disappointing effort .	-1
This is the most meager cash-in attempt I 've ever seen . There may well be hundreds of questions , but it 'll take you a thousand games to see them all . I was receiving a couple or three repeat questions by the fifth game , and a majority of repeats by game 10 . There seems to be little or no gradual increase in difficulty , which was proven when I saw a $ 500 question later repeated as a $ 125,000 question later in the game.An example of the game 's inadequacy runs thusly : I am cruising through the game easily until the $ 32,000 . Fine , by now I 'm expecting them to be tough . I use the 50-50 , then the call a friend , who says she is 75 % certain the answer is ( A ) . Just to be sure , I use the audience poll as well . Guess what , 92 % say that ( A ) is their choice . Well , now I 'm convinced and go with ( A ) as well . I 'm WRONG , it 's ( B ) . That is just stupid beyond measure . If they wanted to throw me off , make the audience rating more like 60-40 % or something.Nice graphics , nice sounds , atrocious game mechanics . Wait for the improved version , or play it on the net .	-1
Believe me , I would give this game zero stars if Amazon.com allowed me.I received this for Christmas as a gift and let me tell you . This is possibly the worst piece of garbage put on the market . I mean , the questions run out fast leaving the game to replay old questions which are easy once you get to know them which means the replay value is n't very high . If you want a fun game try the Sims or Delta Force : Landwarrior . Your time would be better spent with those games .	-1
As others have mentioned , this product has serious flaws -- especially with regard to the pitiful number of questions available . For me , however , a larger complaint is the surprising unfaithfulness to the show.The so-called & quot ; Fastest Finger & quot ; questions are nothing really like those on the show . You do n't compete to put the answers in the right order ; you just buzz in when the computer flashes up the proper arrangement . It 's related to the set of skills necessary on the real show -- but it 's not the same.Likewise , when answering questions in the & quot ; hot seat & quot ; , you do n't really get the & quot ; Is that your final answer ? & quot ; prompting in a consistent way . Only some of the questions allow for it.Also , the questions in the pre- $ 1000 range are unusually difficult , compared with the show . There , they 're ridiculously easy , complete with flatly idiotic possible answers . Here , by contrast , the early questions are much more serious . They 're still comparatively easy , but they 're not the gimmes they are on the real show.Hopefully , the producers will have found a way to be more faithful to the show -- and give us more questions -- for the second edition of this game .	-1
I have to admit that I never was a victim of the & quot ; Tomb Raider Hype Machine & quot ; . I liked the idea of a 3rd person perspective game where your character can do alot of tricks but the whole idea of the big-boobed Lara Croft just turned me off . I bought this for 4 bucks at the used software house and played it for about 2 hours . I liked the save game feature somewhat , it should be more specific . I felt like banging my head against a wall after be killed for the 50th time because I did'nt hit the & quot ; jump & quot ; button in the right sequence with the & quot ; run & quot ; button at the correct prescribed time . The interface is just too rigid for a game like this , it reminded me alot of that old & quot ; Dragon 's Lair & quot ; game . And I got real tired of the stupid puzzles . I think the real reason for TR being so popular is that its the first non-adult game with a overly-endowed female protagonist . It ca n't be because of the gameplay .	-1
I downloaded this from the Nintendo eShop , and I had played Mario Land 2 in the past , which was excellent , but this game is bad . I 'm sure it 's not the worst Mario game out there , but it 's the worst one I 've played . It 's not a horrible game , but it 's just not as good as its predecessors or its successors . The biggest complaint I have are the controls and the physics . It does n't even feel like a Mario game . The controls are klunky and often unresponsive , the physics are weird , like the Fire Flower 's Fireball . It ricochets everywhere before eventually going out . The enemies are unlike anything I 've ever seen in Mario . In one world , you have to Easter Island Heads with arms and legs , kinda like Nosepass from Pokemon . The Koopas explode when you jump on them . I do n't mean they explode and die , i mean , when you jump on them , they go into their shell , and explode like a Bob-Omb , hurting you if you 're too close . The graphics , I ca n't give TOO much flack to because it IS gameboy , but it does n't look much better than the Mario Calculator games I played back in highschool . I 'd say skip this one , go straight to Mario 2 . It 's much MUCH better .	-1
I heard this game is crap . I have it for NES and its cool . But this is weird . Why would they make a stupid 'easy ' game for GBA ? Why wo n't they let you play as the cool people like Baraka ? You stubborn retards can make a better choice of system and game then this ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
Well , here it is guys : the WORST Mortal Kombat game of all-time . Yup , the honor goes to the Game Boy version of Mortal Kombat II.I bought this game when it first came out because I was stupidly riding on the success of the Mortal Kombat series at the time . I was very naive ( all my friends were right ! ) Time has n't been kind to this game , but who am I kidding ? Time was n't kind to this game the day it came out because it was an absolute piece of plastic trash then , and it 's trash now . It will forever remain trash . It 's so trashy , the trashman wo n't even take it . He says it stinks too much , and it 's not worth the risk of potentially sniffing the horrible odor *just* to put the game in the back of his truck . Even if he were to wear the thickest pair of gloves in the world , he does n't want to risk the smell remaining on his skin permanently.So why am I bashing the game so hard ? Because you get fewer fighters , fewer levels , HORRIBLE black and white graphics , and the worst part- an extremely slow framerate . The blood does n't even exist . Okay there 's blood , but watching it on a hard-to-see black and white screen , would you even call that blood ? No , you would n't ( and should n't ) .I would rather have a job being a janitor in an elementary school and having to clean up barf on the cafeteria floors every day , than play the Game Boy version of Mortal Kombat II ever again . It 's really that bad . At least then , you can swirl the puke around with a mop and have some fun.For the love of God and all his wonderful adorable Earthly creatures- DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ! Just when I thought the Mortal Kombat series could n't get any crappier , it happened .	-1
This game is horrid ! The graphics and the framerate are too choppy ! The sound 's okay ( sound effect wise ) , but MKII was never known for it 's music . The control is absolutely horrid ; there are n't enough buttons on the Game Boy and special moves are nearly impossible to pull off ( much less FATALITIES , as there 's only one per character ) .But the worst of it all happens to be the gameplay . Seriously , I beat this game in half an hour ! And when did blood ever become an ink error ? Not worth the price . I suggest that you should dust off your Super NES and buy that version . Avoid Mortal Kombat II on the Game Boy at all costs . The only thing worse than this is the Game Boy port of Mortal Kombat 3 .	-1
If you think a super hero game can never be too fast-pased , this could change your mind . Enemies come at you from every corner throughout the entire game , constantly trying to take you under . You 'd swear you were in Detroit.If you want a slower-paced game based on the animated series , try the SNES version . It does n't let you play as Robin , but it has more depth and . . . wait a minute ! ! I 'm not reviewing the SNES version ! ! ! As either Batman or Robin , you throw various weapons at your enemies as you keep scrolling to the right and trying not to get killed .	-1
I only payed $ 3 for this game at a used game shop . I was very mad when i got home because it wasnt even worth $ 3 . There is nothing good about the game . The graphics such even for the sega genesis . The sound is the worst . The controls are sloppy . The gameplay sucks so bad you wouldnt believe it . Dont but this game even if you 're a batman fan . Stay away from this game .	-1
batman forever is Mortal kombat rebuilt for batman . they put MK 's controls and suk random bat gizmo controls in it . i personally never beaten the game , but maby i just suck at it . that or i lost patiance with it because i ca n't get pat the first hole in the floor . do youself a favor and stay away from this pile of bat crap .	-1
I love the graphics digitized graphics awesome one thing though gameplay much.Why could n't have been a simple beat up the bad guys progress to the next level game Graphics over gameplay classic mistake . To use a gadget you have to put in a button combination like Mortal Kombat even the fighting engine was like Mortal Kombat . To get above and below areas is a chore . If I told you how to get above and to get below areas you 'd be like WTF . Play Batman Forever Arcade on PS1 & Sega Saturan or download it on MAME 32 do n't take my word for it Play it I dare ya ? It 's not as bad as some of the review 's say but boy is this game baaaaaaaaaaaaad !	-1
This is just too bad . For such a cool character , Batman has had some bad luck with video games . This is probably the worst and that 's saying a lot . This game is no fun ( did you see the one star ? ) and is not worth anyone 's time .	-1
I like the original Batman game for this system as oppose to this joke . The graphics are very good I will say that , but terrible gameplay . The fighting system in this game was different and it was more than just a rock'em sock'em still side scroller . I liked how each of the characters had a huge list of moves ; and how you can use them in the dual mode . Despite this being a bad game overrall I remember myself and my brother loved playing this game back in the day . It was cool when I was a pre-teen but now its just one of those stale games .	-1
God , was this game awful . I played this game a while back and I got frustrated with the controls . One of the biggest gripes I had with this game was how the fighting resembled Mortal Kombat 's style . Then again , it was made by Acclaim , the same company that did the Mortal Kombat games . Batman performs leg sweeps , back kicks and even uppercuts , just like MK . This fighting style does n't belong in this game . It just slows things down . You 'll also have trouble navigating through the levels as the foreground will block your eyesight , which makes seeing what you 're doing a hassle . If you 're a Batman fan , you 'll be disappointed with this game . Neither version of this game is good . Stay away from *gulps* Batman Forever .	-1
This game is a joke.The graphics are pretty cool , because they are digitized , but other than that , the game totally blows ! Batman is just some fat guy dressed up in a Batman costume , and the guy playing Robin , looks like he made up his costume , out of cheap used clothes that he bought from a thrift store.The sound is awful.The game play 's like a Mortal Kombat rip-off.It 's just a bad game.If you wan na get a really good Batman game for Genesis , pick up the original `` Batman '' , based on the Tim Burton movie from 1989 , and just stay away from this waste of time .	-1
Batman forever was a game that was n't even worth spending money on buying it those pour kids parents paid 50 bucks when it just came out and when they took it home to play it i bet you they said they spent all that money and it sucked this game was worse then Atari 2600s E.T . and that was the worst game ever made so you ever gave this game 5 stars i mean i like mortal kombat to but this game should be thrown in the trash with all the other garbage because it gave batman a bad reputation	-1
This game is IMPOSSIBLE ! You only have ONE health bar and ONE life ... that 's it ! When you die , it 's right back to the start of the game.It 's a shame too , because this game is actually pretty freaking cool.It 's got an awesome storyline and the graphics and concept were truly ahead of their time , but oh my lord ... .what a hard game this is.I 've heard it said before that this game is very short , but how am I gon na know if I keep dying over and over ? ? ? ? Overall , if you wan na get this for you 're Genesis collection , then I would recommend this game , but as far as playing it goes ... .I hope you love one HELL OF A CHALLENGE .	-1
when i was a kid , i thought this was fun , but i played it lately , this is so boring and dull	-1
If you think that this is a good game then you seriously need your head examinedI can honestly say I 've yet to play a good Spider-Man game . For all the hype , good reviews and people willing to pay the big bucks over this one , I thought it was sure to be the best . How disappointed I was to discover it 's one of the blandest and boring beat-em-ups ever.You begin playing as Spidey ( but can later change to Venom if you wish ) and you go about tiresome duties beating up generic thugs on the streets of Manhattan . Every thug looks the same and you 'll end up punching to death the same guy a billion times ( more so for those infuriating end of level bosses ) . The crap music is the same on every level . Apparently the game has 'additional music ' by some band called Green Jelly , who I have never heard of . I assume they must be some none-hit wonder grunge band from Seattle back when all that was new . And quite what exactly they contributed to the game is a mystery as there are only 2 tracks in total ( level music and boss music ) .There is some plot going on but I could n't follow it . The comic-book cut -scenes look terrible and the writing is too small to read . Plus the are very slow and add too much time between the boring levels.The controls and gameplay are dire . There 's no fluent movement or grace in the fighting . It 's all just an annoying mess and terribly programmed . If you can bear to stay with the game until level 2 you 'll know what I mean . It was so rage-inducing I almost gritted my teeth into dust and chucked the controls into the TV.Stay well away from this horrible game . As a beat-em-up it stinks . As a Spidey game it stinks . It just plain reeks overall.Graphics CSound DGameplay DLasting Appeal F	-1
Not many games are as mindless as T2 , and believe me , that 's not a compliment . You do the same old thing over and over until you ca n't take it anymore . And while it 's kind of fun at first , it dries up quickly . Pass on this one .	-1
This game sucked big time you couldnt do nothing in it when you wanted to and was so hard you died after th first few shots and i was using a game genie for this game the first terminator game was better .	-1
THIS IS THE VERSION OF MORTAL KOMBAT 3 THAT YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY AVOID . THIS GAME WAS HORRIBLE AND IT MAKES THE SUPER NINTENDO VERSION LOOK LIKE A GOOD GAME IN COMPARISON . THE GRAPHICS ARE AWFUL , THE MUSIC IS ANNOYING HERE , THE CONTROLS ARE BAD , AND UNLESS YOU HAVE A 6 BUTTON CONTROLLER FOR THE SEGA GENESIS , YOU CA N'T DO MUCH OF ANYTHING ! ! ! THIS IS A MAJOR DISSAPOINTMENT TO THOSE THAT HAVE THIS GAME ON GENESIS . AVOID THIS VERSION AT ALL COSTS . THIS IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME . THIS VERSION JUST RUINS THIS SOMEWHAT DECENT SEQUEL .	-1
This game seems like it was thrown together to keep as much speed as possible . Back in the early 90s Genesis was the blistering fast system . As per the SEGA gargon . Truth is it was slghtly faster then SNES but could n't handle the colors . So now was know why they left over half the colors of the orginial . Now we are stock with this thing . They kept most of the moves and all the colors , but does n't have any intro or ending animation which means it looks half done . Before you defend this game , think of this . Super Street Fighter looked great , but they they just did n't take the time porting this game . And much like Mortal Kombat it looks drab , choppy , and well peiced together.On the other hand if you are a collector and you want a PR port check out 32X . It is one of the best ports out there . This is one of the most ported games of all time , and the Genesis is one of the ones to try to see how much they took out and how bad it was .	-1
Looks and plays nothing like PC or arcade version and the moves are too complicated . Get MK instead . Terrible .	-1
I remember burrowing this from a friend because I ran out of N64 games to play so I burrowed this and some other games for a few days . I have to say it was fun at first , than it became frustrating , and than I felt like I was going to throw up because of the weird controls and this and that moving around in weird places which I did n't intended in doing . It was also because I was really young then and I really did n't know what the game was really about , which is puzzle solving sometimes.I advise not buying the game , instead tell your friend to buy it because its the best game ever and take it from him when he wants to throw it out . Of course you 'll lose a friend , but well worth it ! Game > Friendship . I 'm just playing kids .	-1
When I think of the N64 , I think about great games and memories . Games like Golden-Eye 64 , The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time , Super Mario 64 , and Banjo- Kazooie . Memories like getting my fore-head shot by my brother , grabbing my 120th power star , and meeting Princess Zelda for the first time.Donkey Kong 64 does n't come up in any of these if you have n't noticed by now , and for good reason . It 's slow , pokey , and not really all that fun . Which is really a problem after the success of the Donkey Kong Country trilogy.THE GRAPHICS : Donkey Kong 64 seems to take the graphics roll from Super Mario 64 , in that the characters are a little on the blocky side , but their really not all bad . I 've only come across a few complaints which is demonstrated in the following description : In one area , the room has a large wooden treasure chest with a switch of the character 's face on it . Sounds fine right ? Wrong , the switch attached to the chest is made from a vent in one of the previous areas . A metal switch attached to a wooden chest . Sheer laziness . VERDICT : *** 3/5THE STORY : Quite simple really , Donkey 's horde of bananas have been stolen once again by King K. Rool , ruler of the Kremling reptiles . He 's also done the liberty of imprisoning all of the other Kongs in cells mapped around the game . The game introduces many new character like Lanky Kong and the banana fairies , along with some pretty whacked up levels . It 's not really all that original , but it works.THE VERDICT : *** 3/5THE GAME-PLAY : This is where Donkey Kong 64 kills , and not in the good way . The game rips from the popular `` grab the golden item to proceed to more levels '' style originated by Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie . Now , that would be fine since the genre has pretty much held water for years , but DK64 has you `` power-walking '' your way through each task , some of which are dragged on already.It takes me about 7 minutes just trying to go to the level I choose ( except the first level ) . The game is loaded with long hallways , ledges you need to slowly climb , and slow frame-rate issues at times . If Rare had upped the speed to about 2.33 times faster , I probably would n't have constantly been yelled at to leave my younger brother 's room so he could sleep . Oh yeah , and I got a serious sore thumb from holding the joystick in the same direction . This game ruins hands , and sleepy little brothers . THE VERDICT : * 1/5THE MUSIC : The game ranges from toy factories , jungles , pyramids and the like , so you can imagine a wide arrange of tunes to come across . Some of the music is pretty catchy , but I did n't find myself dazzled by any means . I found myself humming 2 or 3 songs , but that was it , none of which you 'll be hearing very often . The sound-effects are fitting and pretty original . Thanks to this game every time I see an orange , I immediately think of the sound the orange grenades make in this game . Pretty funny right ? VERDICT : *** 3/5OVERALL : DK64 had a lot of hype , and it 's a shame it did n't turn out since it was made by the same guys behind the Donkey Kong County , Battletoads , and Jet Force Gemini series , which were excellent gems . I played this game as a kid years ago and completed everything in the game , I really must have exaggerated greatly how fun it was back then , because I ca n't seem to have any courage to attempt getting everything in just level 4 . While the music is descent , the graphics okay and the story shallowly good , none of those elements are what make you play a game . You play to have fun , to enjoy the universe of the characters , and to enhance you skills . I 'd be able to accomplish all those things twice as much just eating a banana and watching my dad trim his nails than playing Donkey Kong 64.OOOOH BANANA.OVERALL VERDICT : ** 2/5	-1
I wish they would make a Gamecube side-scrolling Donkey Kong effort like the SNES games , just make the graphics better , retain the music quality and make more levels and longer . They included some lovely old games like the original DONKEY KONG arcade game , and a spaceman game for computer . There are big worlds , but that seems just about it . There 's a lot of collecting , but the problem-solving is no fun . This series became really removed from it 's huge SNES appeal .	-1
I bought DK64 when it first came out in 1999 , and from the moment I started to play it I did not like it at all . It is way too complicated and difficult to play , and I would not recommend this game . Every time I tried to play it I just kept getting frustrated , and I had to stop playing it . Instead I would recommend Banjo-Kazooie or Mario 64 .	-1
What a weird game . I got this expecting the same type of thing that was going on in those great super nintendo games . But hey , if you like confusing and weird puzzles than you might enjoy this game . I suggest that you get it anyway but only to see how different it is than the dk country games . This is a puzzle level game , not a dk country game . I got bored and annoyed with it and stopped playing after having it for a few weeks.These are my updated comments . Recently , I challenged my review above and my view of this game . I decided to learn how to get good at it , thus , leading to enjoyment of the game . I actually got hooked , playing it for over 80 hours so far . Point being , this game is not awful , it is , however , tricky . If you enjoy Glover or even if you somehow found a way to enjoy Mario 64 , you will like this game . I would say that my new rating of fun would be 4 of 5 and my new overall would be 3 of 5 . The overall is still low because of how frustrating this game is .	-1
To say the least , Donkey Kong took everything this genre stood for , and made a muck-up of it . Endless item collecting , muddy details and slow action leave this one for the chimps , uh , chumps.You have bananas , golden and coloured , coins , coconuts , ammo , musical notes etc . and for five characters . The collecting seems endless , and when i was forty % done the game , i just stopped . I looked at this forest level and i said , this looks just like the desert and water ones , only with a different backdrop.And what 's with the story ? Some giant floating island or something ? Why does K Rool have such a loathing for the Kongs ? WHy does n't he just butcher them instead of placing them in unguarded , easily escapable places ? ? ? ? Rare really messed up on this one . The sound is n't all that awesome ( the DK rap , what the heck was that ? ) , and the graphics were bleh ; this thing required the 4mb expansion ? Banjo Kazooie looked twice as good.Even the characters are lame . I thought the release of Kiddy Kong in DKC3 was dumb , but now we have three new characters that couldve easily been replaced by 2 old ones . Tiny is the spitting image of Dixie , and Lanky is the babyish side of Kiddy while Chunky is , well the chunky side.I think Rare thought their game was weak themselves , that must be why they added this mediocre 3rd person shooter multiplayer , is n't it ? They did n't think they did a good job on the shooter part did they ? I have so many peeves about this game , it 's nuts . What difference is tehre between the gun and the instrument ? ? ? They both unlock things . Why did Rare feel it necessary to have two things that can work switches ? ? Honestly , the only entertaining and redeeming part of this game are the Jetpac and Donkey Kong hidden arcade games.Certainly a long game , but length is not always a good thing . Look at Conker 's BFD , it was short , and still owned this game wicked bad . 15 hours of this , and you 'll wish Rare had stopped there .	-1
PROs : Encourages explorationIntense final battle against bossGraphics state-of-the-art for its timeCONs : Frustrating anglesTedious and repetitive gameplayBeaver Bother ( you know what I 'm talking about if you 've played this game ) I had always heard how DK64 was such a classic , and so naturally I wanted to finally buy and beat it.Instead of a classic , I found a game that was , well , kind of lazy . You essentially have 7 levels before the boss level , and you have to beat each of these levels with 5 different characters . So , you have to spend your time getting all of DK 's bananas and missing the other 4 characters ' bananas , because only Diddy can get Diddy bananas , only Tiny can get Tiny coins , etc . This means you have to basically go back and re-do the whole level with another character all over again.Couple this with the fact that camera angles are constantly changing on you , it makes for a very ho-hum experience.At one point during the 30 hours it took me to beat this game , I turned on the game and found all my data was erased . At first I was angry , but then kind of relieved that I did n't have to feel like I needed to finish this game anymore . That 's saying a lot , because I always finish games I start . ( I turned the game on-and-off again , and the data was there again , so I did finish playing it . But the point still stands : I WANTED my data to be erased . )	-1
donkey kong is a stupid game the charaters are monkeys for the love of God monkeys.this game does not have a story line do not try this game .	-1
I borrowed this game from a friend . I played for half an hour then got bored . I 'm glad I did n't pay money for it . It 's pretty much just Banjo-Kazooie ( which I also did n't like ) . I was upset , especially when I got to the first door requiring gold bananas . Why could n't they have just put out another Banjo-Kazooie game and make an ORIGINAL Donkey Kong game for the N64.Banjo-Kazooie was fun , until the difficulty spiked out of nowhere . Also , the idea of making a cartoonish adventure somewhat nonlinear is poorly executed in it.I did n't play far enough to see if Donkey Kong corrected any of this , but it looks like it did n't . It just changed the setting from running around inside of a mountain to running around inside of islands . Great.If you liked Banjo-Kazooie , I 'm sure you 'll love this . If not , definitely skip Donkey Kong .	-1
For the Nintendo '64 gaming system , the two pre-eminent adventure games were Mario and Zelda . Those games enthralled players with their tight gameplay and interesting stories . Unfortunately , DK '64 does n't have that same tight gameplay , and the story was never the strong suit of the series.The problem with this game is obvious after about 30 minutes : It 's all about collecting items , and very little else . Whether it is coins , tokens , or bananas , this game quickly devolves into little more than a scavenger hunt for miscellaneous items . Making matters worse is the fact that EACH CHARACTER needs to collect each item to unlock certain features . The game is tedious enough playing just as a single character , but add in the four others and it becomes ridiculous.The music in this game is engaging ( the DK Rap might just be the highlight of the whole experience ! ) , but other than that nothing really stands out . If you do n't mind collecting item after item , you 'll like this game more than I . If you prefer a developed plot , however , than stay away at all costs .	-1
mischief makers ? what does make you think of ? teenagers who get bored and break stuff ? firecrackers ? practical jokes ? pranks ? how about ... ... ... ... none of the above.how about some crap that looks like it belongs on the original atari ? no mischief , just a very poorly animated and quite bright super mario bros rip off.save your money a buy a box a paper clips.youll have more fun .	-1
the game is maybe not terribly amusing , but amusingly terrible . the gameplay from this game is pretty much the same as the original . the graphics are bright vibrant colours , which are quite fun . the gameplay element is very redundant and gets old fast . it 's fun for a level or two but i would n't recomend this game for anyone .	-1
This game was much more entertaining in it 's time . I bought it a while ago played it for 5 minutes then NEVER touched it again ...	-1
Star Wars : Shadows of the Empire was released near the end of 1996 and was one of the first generation games for the N64 . It 's a decent Star Wars game overall with nagging issues that keep it from being one of the better games for the system.Set after the events in the movie Star Wars V : The Empire Strikes Back but before the events in the movie Star Wars VI : Return of the Jedi ( and also based on the book of the same name ) , you set out to help Luke Skywalker and rescue Princess Leia from the hands of Prince Xizor . Choose from 3 difficulty levels and battle through 9 levels set in planets that are part of the Star Wars universe ; battling enemies and making your way around as you would in a platform game.The PROS : Well , the overall presentation is good enough to make you feel you 're in the Star Wars universe as the sound effects and music are what you expect to hear in Star Wars games . Even though the game has 9 levels , they are long levels so you wo n't be cruising through so easily.The CONS : Unfortunately , this is not one of the better SW games available for the N64 for several reasons . This game was part of the first generation of games for the N64 and it shows . The graphics did not age so well and back in 1996 , they were horrible . Super Mario 64 was a launch title and it had way better graphics . Here , the game gets choppy when there 's a lot of action , the frame rate dips every so often and there is lots of `` pop up '' scenery and dense fog ( to cover up areas that do n't have any animation . ) The controls are no better than the ones in the PS title `` Tomb Raider '' . Your character controls like a robot , aiming is a chore to do and the game has horrible collision detection . Add in the platform elements where you have to jump in certain areas and either you end up dying or trying to jump again because the jump button does n't respond until a full second AFTER you press it . On top of all that , the game 's difficulty is pretty unforgiving . Even if you set in on `` easy '' , the enemies are still pretty tough and sometimes you have no idea if your weapons have an effect on whoever you are shooting at.Considering that the first level is easily the best of the game altogether , you 're pretty much hyped and ca n't wait to see the rest of the game . Unfortunately , when you do , you realize that the game falls flat on its face . Star Wars : SotE had a lot of potential . It 's a Star Wars game and gives you the feeling that you 're part of the awesome story it conveys . But that feeling goes away fast as the crappy graphics , robot like controls , bad platform elements and near impossible difficulty that this game presents keeps it from being the kind of game it could have been . Only the die hard Star Wars fans would pick this up . For everyone else , be warned as other Star Wars games released for the N64 are much , much better than this somewhat playable effort .	-1
For the past few months I 'd been picking up old N64 games that I did n't get a chance to purchase during their initial release , and when I saw Shadows of the Empire I immediately grabbed it , being the big Star Wars fan that I am.Shadows was one of the launch games for the N64 , and while it might have been a decent game in its day , maybe even a good game ( I ca n't , however , believe it was ever considered a great game ) , it has n't aged well at all . To compare , I also recently grabbed Super Mario 64 , the original launch game , and still found plenty of charm left in that old cartridge.The graphics are a mixed bag . Our hero , Dash , is rendered rather nicely , with more polygons than one might expect . The levels , however , have ugly textures that will remind the player of early pseudo 3-D games like DOOM and Dark Forces . Hardly the graphical quality the N64 is capable of . Enemies such as the Stormtroopers and mercenaries are fuzzy with blurred details . However , the graphics on the flying missions and the speeder bike level are exceptional . With regards to sound , John Williams score has never failed before , and fortunately , the music combined with classic Star Wars sound effects is just what Star Wars fans want.Where the game really fails is the gameplay . Shadows tries to include many different modes of play , and not all of them work . The snow speeder level is a classic , as it inspired the game Rogue Squadron ; the speeder bike chase is rather cool , as is the fight with Boba Fett . However , in other areas of the game , your craft is stationary and all you are required to do is shoot . It 's not much different from the Super Nintendo Star Wars games , and the simplistic gameplay can only entertain for so long . Then there is the first-person levels , which unfortunately make up the bulk of the game . Though the game has multiple view modes , Dash is easiest to control in the first-person mode , but the player wo n't even see the tip of Dash 's gun , as is customary with all shooters . There is no target reticle , making aiming irratic . The levels are too big and empty , and are too straightforward . It 's a simple matter to walk from point A to point B , with few surprises . You 'll find yourself rushing through most of the game to get to the better levels , but unfortunately they 're few and far in between.If you 're a Star Wars fan , there 's still enough here to warrant a purchase , but mostly it 'll be for a piece of N64 Star Wars history . While I might have had different feelings about this game had I bought it at launch , I ca n't imagine feelings much more impressed by it . Shadows of the Empire is the most disappointing of all the N64 Star Wars games .	-1
When Yoshi 's Story came out , I was stoked thinking it was a 64-bit sequel to Yoshi 's Island . I was SO WRONG . This game is aimed at 5-10 year old gamers . You go around & # 34 ; Chapters & # 34 ; collecting fruit in the levels to advance , thus levels have no actual exit . There 's 4 areas in each chapter . 6 chapters calls for 24 total levels in the game . To make this game even more disappointing , when you finish one level ( say 1-1 ) , you 'd think you go to 1-2 , but no . Instead you go to Chapter 2 . What the heck ? ! It turns out you have to find red hearts hidden in each level to unlock a level in the next chapter . To unlock all of Chapter 1 's level you have to complete one level , die , then go back . It 's a stupid setup . I was really hoping for a Yoshi 's Island 2 type game here but this is Nintendo cashing in on their child fanbase . Basically , if you 're older than 10 , this game will be too childish for your liking .	-1
This game was a little bit dissapointing , I mean , it 's fun to play with your friends , but even that novelty wares off kind of fast , but there is pretty much no single player . The single player mode is completely boring . This game is kind of like something you would play at an arcade , it 's good , but I would n't really recommend it .	-1
this game was okay not one of the best fighting games i 've played but it was okay . the characters are hard to controll and it 's hard to make them do thier specail moves . but it 's okay for a try i would n't buy it .	-1
Wargods is a much better game made by the same people for the N64 . This game is somewhat glitchy and straining . Save your money . Buy a better Mortal Kombat game for a newer system . Not worth having .	-1
This version of the trilogy absolutly stunk to high heaven . What the hell happend ? ? ? I first brought the MK Trilogy on PC . But after I upgraded to Windows 98 the game would not install anymore , it only worked on Win 95 . So I saw the playstaion version , but I never liked the PS and I saw that it was exactly the same as the PC version.. so I figured the N64 version would be just the same ... . wrong ! ! ! ! There is about 20 charactors missing from the 64 version for some unknown reason . They could well have included them but for some reason this game is more like Mortal Kombat 3 with a few extra charactors.I hope the PC version gets re-released some day . Or maybe i 'll just get a PS version Rom , because MK trilogy is the best MK game ever ... just not on the 64 .	-1
blends 3 mortal kombats in one , not the first three games that i expected . game play was lame . Not for beginners very hard .	-1
This game is so stupid , i do n't understand why people like it . There is no real fun in it . For one thing you ca n't jump/ wich is dumb . and the attack moves are really duel . it sucks ! do not buy this game.If by any chance you liked this game then check out all of the other Bomberman games .	-1
I was extremely disappointed with this title . You will like it if you like Goldeneye , but definitely go with Goldeneye over this game . The multiplayer is 50 times better than Goldeneye , but the cheats and single player levels leave EVERYTHING to be desired . For one thing , it requires more sneaking around because one missed shot hits the wall letting the guards know of your presence who will then hit you with perfect accuracy and kill you in a matter of seconds because of your quickly draining life meter . You also run out of bullets faster and reload much slower . The difficulty is just about near impossible . If you ca n't beat Goldeneye with EVERYTHING as in cheats , bonus levels , record times , etc , DO NOT BUY THIS GAME . You ca n't beat this game on Perfect Agent unless you 're a game tester , and I 'm sure even they had problems . The game is so hard it just totally degrades from the fun factor . The plot is also absurd . Aliens and such . Ha Ha . Amusing . DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ! I strongly reccomend going for Goldeneye rather than Perfect Dark .	-1
... the actual game is okay but certainkly isnt on par with goldeneye . with the exception of the man dan carrington the characters are wooden and the story is very poor , you never feel into the game 's story at all . the level design in general is bad , like the supposed 'stealth ' mission in chicago where every enemy knows where you are anyway so there is no stealth involved whatsoever . some of the levels though are fun with inspired design like the sniping levcel in the snow but it doesnt make the game good.what does make the game worth playing is the multi player modes , although the graphics take another turn for the worse they are acceptable in 2 player but with 4 you cant see anything at all without a massive tv . the multi modes make pd , beating the hell out of simulants in slow motion can be fun and sure beats the game . this is what you should be buying the game for , not for the story mode . the trouble with this is that the pd arenas are poor and its only the graphically altered goldeneye levels that are worth playing . a bit lazy on the developers part.overall : except for the inclusion of mr. carrington the story mode is a bust so unless you have enough mates to make the multi worthwhile dont buy it .	-1
I bought this game way back when the N64 was in its heyday . I thought it was n't very good and traded it in . Now I see somebody is trying to sell it for $ 89.95 ! If anybody is considering buying Quest 64 at this ridiculous price , I urge them to think twice . There are plenty of far , far better games for your money . I know there were n't that many RPGs for the N64 but that does n't make this game a classic IMHO . You 'd be better off looking for some of the excellent SNES RPGs like FF II and III or Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past .	-1
First off my rating is high because I really enjoyed this game.2ndly it was a N64 RPG , which I do n't remember there being many.You end up using the elements as magic and you mix and match to kind of make your own play style.The battle mechanics were odd , but I always enjoyed games that were challenging so you had to think out what you were going to do , sometimes you would lose a battle due to making a bad move , and you can learn from it and do better.Unless your someone who likes to play old games , avoid this one , there are games which are all around upgrades.Try Fate or Fable .	-1
In my opinion , the only thing this game has going for it is that it did n't have any competition in the field of RPGs until the Zelda action RPGs . The developers of this game should be ashamed of themselves for creating this . I bought the game a couple of years ago and it still sits there and collects dust . I probably played it for four hours or so and put it away . I want those four hours back that I wasted . Nevermind , I would just waste them anyways .	-1
Quest 64 is a Role Playing game that stresses 3d eye-candy , with little depth of story , plot , and no long lasting appeal ( all three are essential , along with others , for a good rpg ) .The main character only has one weapon and a few items which most of which repeat themselves in a pattern throughout the entire game.There are no side quests or red herrings to keep you intrigued , no easter eggs.The battle system first of all is the most boring turn based combat system ive ever seen . Oh and youll spend 80 percent of the game running around the countryside fighting monsters to build your levels ( thats all the game 's empahsis is on , building levels ) and thatll bore you after about a couple of hours , off and on . The game 's story seems to get loss in the building of levels after the first few hours or so.The amazing 3d graphics are the only thing really good about this game , as its the only thing that really keeps it from getting one star . But still graphics dont make up for a game with such a linear monotonous flow.I recently re-read some of the previous Nintendo Powers reviews of this game hyping it up as being as good as Final Fantasy series ... .that was a selling/promotional point more than anything else , since as the first editorial writer above said , `` Quest 64 sinks in too many areas : ( to paraphrase him ) .If you can find this game used at a exchange store for 5 dollars nowdays then I would buy it , thankfully I only rented it and the guide , rather than pay 50 bucks for this game when it first came out , you should do the same .	-1
This game is to dark to see anything and hard to play with the controls provided . I 'd recommend upgrading to a different system for this game .	-1
Well this game features some of the best graphics Ive ever seen and its easier to learn how to play than Rogue Leader but what were they thinking when they decided not to have a save option ? N64 is a superior machine so its not like it doesnt have enough memory to support a save option and even old games like Metroid and The Legend Of Zelda let you save your progress with a password . This game is just like one of those arcade games at movie theatres because its fun to play for a while but pointless to try and beat it because it just doesnt let you save . The new Star Fox game for Game Cube sure as hell better have a save option .	-1
Mario Kart 64 will always be the best . I do n't consider myself fully biased , though . This game really is that bad .	-1
Diddy Kong Racing , simply put , is a game I have tried to love , and simply can not do it . I have even tried to play it , but I can not simply stand playing this insipid game . I do now know why , but this simply is not a good game . Perhaps it is particular tastes . But I simply can not stand this game . The tracts are fairly imaginative . One grating thing about it is say you hit a tree . Well , instead of bouncing off like on many other racing games , you stay bashing into the tree . It does have some interesting features , however . The sheer volume of tracts ( had it been any other game would have been a plus ) shows ingenuity , the story line is interesting , but in execution the game just flails horribly.Why do I give it 2 stars ? The concept . I love the concept . Making an adventure out of a racing game , and the format they gave it is an excellent idea . The sheer number of tracks is exhilarating . And on some courses there are THREE ( plane , hovercraft , kart ) types of vehicles to use . It is just a tragedy that in practice it does n't come off at all . It is nowhere near Super Mario Kart 64 . That game is fast-paced and loads of fun , the best racer to hit the N64 . Size wise , this dwarves Mario Kart 64 . If they could have had the execution on Mario Kart 64 and the concept of Diddy Kong Racing , we would have had one hell of a game . Sadly , such a game does not exist ( yet ) . We have to settle with a badly executed game ( Diddy Kong Racing ) with another racing game that is superb in all manner of ways . But , with a little engineering , we could have the best of both worlds . Super Mario Kart 64 is the way to go , folks . The multiplayer battle is really fun too , especially Block Fort . Superiour in concept , inferiour in execution . That 's the bottom line .	-1
What can I say , this game was dumb ! It 's just a copycat of Mario Kart 64 and Mario Kart 64 has freakin ' fun ! Diddy Kong Racing is a joke ! I would have rated it as `` 0 stars , '' but unfortunately I do n't have that option . If you want to give someone a hate gift , I recommend this . But do n't blame me if they surprisingly love it .	-1
the graphics is pretty good on this game , but the game play sucks . it 's not worth your money .	-1
Another lousey boring basketball game . where do they come up with these games . this game was stupid .	-1
what a joke , this game is worthless . I would n't have taken this game if it had been for free , let alone 4 dollars !	-1
this game sucks big time . it was boring and stupid .	-1
This could be considered the companion to Alien Trilogy as it takes place in the Fourth Movie following the first three presented in Alien Trilogy . This game featured controls that people are more familiar with in these days , but did n't understand at the time . The controls may be above average , and the graphics are excellent for the time , but seriously , the level design is a piece of crap ! What kind of space ship is this ? Very illogical design leads to BORING gameplay that is only fun for 5 minutes with invincibility turned on , otherwise you 'll die in 2 minutes without it because you move soo slow . An interesting thing is that if you get impregnated by a facehugger you wo n't be allowed to go through airlocks or elevators , which is interesting that they followed through on this principal with the chestbursters , and you 'll have to find a device to take out the creature before the time runs out . The thing that does n't make sense with this is that even with a chestburster inside you , aliens will attack you , and that makes no sense . Facehuggers can also attack you by hitting you with their tails . Do n't play this game , I 'd rather watch the movie .	-1
Alien Ressurection the game , makes the movie of the same title look like an Oscar winning masterpiece ( well , ok maybe not ) . The only reason it got two stars was for the awesome atmosphere and graphics that this game has to offer plus the level of geniune fear and suspense that it conjurs up.Now for the bad ... nothing ever really happens in this game . At times , it is downright BORING . You wander around in the pitch black half the time waiting for something really bad to happen ... but it never does . When I say this game is dark , I mean dark as in no light . You ca n't see half the time and the worthless flashlight that you have runs out of batteries every five minutes . The controls are sloppy and unnecessarily difficult . The weapons/ammo are limited and you really have to search for them in some of the later levels which makes the game seem contrived , like they added that feature only to make the game longer . Alien Trilogy was a much better game . Like the Alien movies , too many sequels makes for a predictable and downright boring ride .	-1
I rented this game once , thinking it might be a cool rpg/ puzzle solving . Boy- Was I wrong . This game is very boring , and has no real point . It is extremely hard to maneuver your character without a demon jumping on your back , or your character falling to his death . I gave up after the first level . Whatever you do ... DO NOT buy this game .	-1
This game is a kind of blend of Space Harrier , Gauntlet , with fps influences . It 's not that interesting in any department . Once you 've played through level one you 've just about seen all it has to offer . Gameplay boils down to holding down the strafe and shoot buttons . The special weapons are n't that useful . The small nuclear bomb is just a key that materializes right in front of the door you have to use it on , it 's kind of funny the first time , that 's about it . You have a sniper rifle and a parachute but the level design does n't use them to full effect . Character design is mostly boring , just a naked guy spray painted black , the helmet is kind of interesting in sniper mode with the HUD and Darth Vader sound effect . Enemy designs generally look like fluctuating polygons , the game runs too fast most of the time to tell what they are . Platforming sections are harder than they need to be because the controls and physics are n't that good , you can phase right through some platforms .	-1
The Good : Decent humor , fast action , cool sniper rifleThe Bad : Hideous graphics , horrible jumping sequences , no voices ? This is yet another great game by renowned developer Tim Schaffer who is known for games such as Wild 9 , Earth Worm Jim , and Psychonauts . This game has a great dose of humor with things like `` The world 's smallest nuclear explosion '' ... it 's ingenious ! Tim always has the humor in the gameplay and not just with dialog and videos . The story is almost non existent ( as were most of Tim Schaffer 's older games ) you play a guy with a pointy armor nose and you take it off for a gun and you put it on for a sniper rifle . You have three `` windows '' on your rifle to see where your bullets are going . This is good for lobbing mortars into tubes to kill protecting enemies etc . While the action is fast paced there are a lot of problems . The jumping sequences are terrible thanks to the character moving way too fast . The graphics are hideous even for the PS1 . Everything looks flat , brown , and boring . There are also no voices at all . If you can stomach all this you can pick it up fairly cheap ( it 's not one of those ULTRA rare $ 100 eBay games ) .	-1
Here comes the ( one-time ) end of an era . And sadly , it ends not with a bang , but with a whimper . Like MM7 before it , Mega Man 8 suffered quite a bit of backlash , and this time around it was a result of the rather unbecoming 16-bit-ish graphical structures on the 32-bit wonders of the Sega Saturn and Sony Playstation , and , if you ask me , it was not the title to follow the monstrous Mega Man X4 that came out around the same time . Still , for all the weeping against statues , MM8 still serves up some classic Mega Man fun with that new-school Mega Man X feel . The searching for hidden items becomes more important and challenging this time around , the action is still consistently hectic , and the level designs are pretty nicely done with some rich and vivid color work . However , there 's a very cheesy , sugar-coated appeal to this , even more so than MM7 ( which , I think , was trying to emulate the American animated series ) ; that and the bosses and weapons do n't seem as good as they could have been , Rush 's abilities are n't as important as they used to be , and the voice acting is atrocious for certain characters ( Dr. Light , Bass , and some of the bosses are the prime sinners in this regard ... and Rush Shiraishi did a better job voicing X in X4 than she did Mega Man in this . It fits better , if you ask me ) . Still , there 's enjoyment to be had . Just remember to take it at face value ... and consider it a stepping stone to Mega Man 9 .	-1
This X game was just tedious . I remember the original X game on the SNES was fun , as were X2 and X3 , but this one was just bad . Playing as X or Zero was fun , but Zero was hard to control and both storylines were , well , boring . I was almost to the point of yawning . Plus , it was easy to figure out who the final boss was for anyone who has ever played an X game . Additionally , some of the upgrades to Xs armor made him harder to operate , and , well , I guess what I really want to say is this was boring . I was bored stiff . I could n't wait to beat it so I could move on to something else . Unlike X , X2 and X3 , there is almost no replay value in this game . I mean , beyond the cheat codes for the special X armor and Dark Zero , nothing . I only hope that X5 and X6 are better , but I 'm not sure if they will be .	-1
This review is hard to write because I am so mad that I wasted my money on this game . Oh whoopie , you can play as Zero the fighter , butt zero is how much I should 've payed for this game . There is n't one thing about this game that I like . The story [ is bad ] and the fight and graphics are absolutely awful . If you want a real game , do n't waste your money on this . Do n't even rent this game . This game is so bad it make Pong look good .	-1
I could only get to the first boss . Do n't get me wrong I had fun with this game , but many factors killed it for me.Most noticebly is the controls . The controls in this game are aweful ! You have no idea how many cheep deaths the controls caused me . Its the main reason why I could never get pass the first boss . This is an extreme problem when you 're facing more than one enemy because the controls wo n't respond when you need them to . The camera does n't make things any easier . When platforming the jumping controls and camera will often cause cheep deaths because you ca n't see where your going or jump at an angle that causes you to fall off.Another issue I had is that when you get a game over you start all the way to the beginning of the game . Extra lives are also hard to find . This would n't be so bad if the controls were n't so bad.The plus side though is that the music is wonderful and there are moments that are creepy AND SCARY . I would love it if they remade this for the Wii , Xbox , or PS3 with better controls and handling , but due to how long its been I do n't see that happening .	-1
I bought this when I was a huge X-Files fan and I thought its ok but basically its hit a button see a cinamatic and I beat the game in like 2 days it is n't that good	-1
it says it is in good condition but lots of scratches does not even work never played it do n't buy	-1
After I saw the movie I was in a real & quot ; X-Men & quot ; mood so I went out and bought this game . When I started playing it I became very frustrated . It does n't show you how to do any of the moves in the instruction book ( not that I ever need an instruction book to learn moves ) . To do moves in this game it takes a lot of practice . So to find out how to do anything with a character you have to go into this boring and frustrating training mode . Once you master a character it is then easy to complete the game . But then , if you want to play another character , you have to go back into the training mode all over again . The endings in this game are very short and unsatisfying . The good thing is that after you have beaten the game with everybody you can view each ending linked up together and then it makes a lot more sense and you get more satisfaction . There 's lot of things to unlock in this game but no codes . No secret characters . The worse part about this game is the gameplay . I recently went back to play this game after not playing it for about a year . I found out that I had forgotten to do all of the moves . So rather than go back into training mode I just turned it off and put it anyway . I 'll probably never play it again .	-1
As a fan of the X-Com games and Shadow Watch , I was really looking forward to this game . Based on the Editorial Reviews on this site , I was expecting somethiing in a similar vein.Unfortunately , there are some subtle problems with this game that make it vastly inferior to the previously mentioned titles , and cause the game play to be rather slow and frustrating.Problems with the tactical level : # 1 . Extremely long fights : Most of the weapons in this game are frustratingly innacurate and do n't do much damage . As a result , fights go on and on and on and on and on and . . well , you get the idea . In X-Com and Shadow Watch , fire fights tend to be relatively quick and decisive . If a bad guy steps out in front of you without cover , he goes down . In this game though , he can stand right in front of you at a range of three or four spaces and it will still take a few turns to kill him . You shoot and miss , and shoot and miss and so on . And then when you finally do hit the guy , it takes five or six shots to take him down . Your mouse hand will get sore from all the point and clicking . Both the accuracy and the lethality of all the weapons in the game should be about doubled or trippled , which would lead to shorter , more decisive engagements . 2 . Computer controlled characters have a huge advantage in accuracy : This is a weird glitch that becomes really obvious from about the second fight onwards . All computer controlled units are roughly two to three times as accurate as your ( supposedly elite ) mercenary units . What does this mean ? A couple of examples : a . ) One of your mercenaries ( with a high accuracy rating ) is lying on the ground , firing at an opponent lying on the ground , with no intervening cover . The computer controlled character will hit you about four times for every time you hit him . b . You have a unit which has carfully positioned itself crouching behind a tree for cover , shooting at a computer unit standing in the open . You will hit each other with about the same frequency.While over all game balance is preserved by the fact that your mercs can just take so damn much damage , it still makes game play awefully frustrating . Here you are , knocking yourself out to find good covered positions to protect your guys , and the computer still hits them easily , while you 're missing its guys that are out in the open . The problem becomes even more annoying once you start training local militia to protect your villages . Being computer controlled , the local militia also benefit from this huge increase in accuracy , which means that they completely outclass the mercenaries who trained them . Which makes you wonder why they needed your mercenaries to come liberate them in the first place.Problems with the Strategic Level : Unbalance Economy : Simply put , the amount of money running around in the game does n't balance out against the cost of most items . Local Militia , for example , can be trained for $ 750 , a sum so small by comparison to what your mines are turning out that it does n't even enter into your strategic thinking . Similarly , the rewards for completing quests in the game are ludicrously small wnen compared to your income . What do you say to a major NPC who is trying to get you to do some major quest by offering you 20K dollars . & quot ; Hello , I make more than that in a single day of mining . Why should I bother ? & quot ; . The numbers on a lot of this stuff need to be adjusted . 2 . A preponderence of innefectual hand guns : For some reason , most of the mercs that you can afford at the start of the game come equipped with hand guns rahter than assault rifles . Excuse me ? A professional merc who 's going to airdrop into the middle of a civil war with only a pistol ? This is particularly ludicrous when you realize how innefectual handguns are in this game . Even at close range , an NPC is likely to die of old age long before you ever manage to finish him off with a .38 revolver . Adding to this problem is the fact that you ca n't buy rifles . Oh sure , the nice mail order company that you do business with will send you ammo , but not big guns , grenades , night vision goggles , or any of the really cool stuff that you want to play with . To get that stuff , you have to ever so slowly find it off the bodies of dead enemies . In the course of 15 hours of play , I managed to find only two rifles . Unfortunately , they were of a calliber that I could n't buy ammo for . Arrg . Why ca n't you just buy decent armaments in this game ? Overall , I would have to encourage people to buy all the X-Com games and Shadow Watch before buying this one . And even then , I would replay the former titles again before sending buying this one . Firefights in Jagged Alliance are needlessly long and indecisive , there is little variation between combat locations and opponents , and there is a lot of built in frustration in the fact that your units are so vastly inferior to those controlled by the computer . This is a game with a lot of subtle problems that should have been caught in the beta testing .	-1
I 've heard about this game Rainbow Six for years . I 've always been curious about it but I have n't played it till recently . I must be missing something because for some reason I did not enjoy this game very much.One thing I 've always heard about Tom Clancy games from players is `` they are so realistic '' . The realism is Rainbow Six is partly what drags the game down . Everything is caught up in trying to be as real as possible that for me at least , it sucked the fun right out of the game . The premise of the game is that you are leading an anti-terrorist group called `` Rainbow '' made up of the top special forces operatives in the world . But from the outset the game is bogged down in tedious details . Mission planning is unncessarily over complicated . I spent maybe an hour planning a mission that my team was wiped on in under 3 minutes . It seems that three quarters of the game is spent in the planning stage . Selecting team members , equipment , weapons , mapping a mission plan all seem more important that actually performing the mission . This led me to bouts of `` Oh come on ! ! I just want to play the game ! ! ! '' . The online play does n't fair much better either I 'm sorry to say . The average online game is about 30 seconds in length and I was frequently shot in the back after the first 5 seconds . After which I was relegated to watching the other online players . Also the problem of veteran players racking up stats for some game `` leagues '' by preying on lesser skilled players is rampant . Unfortunatley there 's not much that can be done about that.The controls fair no better . The control scheme is complex to the point of frustration . Other teams just stand there waiting for you to give them `` GO Codes '' . But they are more like ducks in a shooting gallery . Being picked off one by one till you are the only player left . There is an option to remap the keyboard controls but that unfortunatly does n't make things any easier.The graphics look a bit dated but the game ran very smoothley on my computer.Rainbow Six is a game that has a really good idea but falls horribley short in its execution . It 's needlessly complex and overly tedious . If you are a Playstation 2 owner I 'd recomend SOCOM : US Navy Seals over Rainbow Six . For PC I would recomend Operation Flashpoint . Both are alot more playable and more enjoyable .	-1
This is a superb shooting game with lots of realism and strategy incoprorated . Graphics are great as is choice of team-mates and weaponary . I guess that it pretty realstic in a lot of ways as your team mates get in your way , and the terrorists are not as stupid as they are on some other games - they will shoot at you as soon as they see you . But there are times when you shoot at a terrorist and he does n't die but shoots you instead . It seems to be a problem with the game . There are lots or really weird glitches too . You see dead terrorists levitating and half of them stuck through walls and their legs hanging down through the roof etc . I find it irritating that the designers take so much care to make tyres go down when you shoot them , and different sounds when you shoot a bed or a window , but then so little detail is given to other aspects such as the lights which do n't go out if you shoot them . I have never seen lights like that . `` Goldeneye '' has lights that pop so why does n't this ? A lot of this game is just too difficult to win at . In addition , you get a mission such as the one at the datcha where you must avoid detection - this is really difficult . The idea is to plant a bug and a camera and leave as though you 've never even been there . You can go round and shoot al the windows out and still complete the level ... and no one will notice that there are windows missing , glass everywhere and bullet holes in the walls ? My point is , if you are going to go for realism then go all the way , or not at all . My low rating for this game is due to the problems I have had playing it on the PC . I think it 's a game with really great potential , but you end up waiting all the time while the computer makes grinding sounds which freeze your action , but while you are frozen it really impedes playability and you end up getting shot because you ca n't react . Unplayable due to this , and I have a powerful computer , so that 's not the problem . This is overambitious for the PC market , and there are things that need rethinking to make it a better game .	-1
This game has no sense of linearity to it at all ... You spend most of the game trying to figure out where to go next , and mostly being wrong . I ca n't even really say this game was remotely fun to play . In fact , the only reason I kept playing was because I was hoping to find some kind of story hidden in this madness ... but I didn't.The game boasts seven different main characters , all with their own backgrounds and skills . You can play the game as any one of them , while meeting the rest along the way . The problem is that all the intertwining story-lines get so crosswired that after a while you do n't remember who 's character you are really playing , and what your original goal was.In the same respect , the game is huge . Once you get past a certain stage , the entire world is left before you , and you can go where you want , and do what you want , without having to stay within the confines of your particular storyline . Some people may like this freedom , but I found it annoying ! I love the idea of being able to explore the world on my own , but I never had a sense of purpose throughout the game . I never really knew where to go next , and every time I went to a new city I just felt like I was going around in circles and not making any progress.Needless to say , I have n't completed this game , and I do n't plan on it anytime soon . This game is just bad ! If you want to wander aimlessly around a series of cartoony cities , each with hidden dungeons and shops and no sense of purpose whatsoever , then by all means get this game . I for one would rather spend my money on a nice root canal , or perhaps a spinal tap .	-1
This was the most boring game I 've ever bought . Do n't let the description of multiple games with multiple characters fool you . It 's one game that you go through with various times with different characters . The valiant effort of a very non-linear storyline was marred by the fact that it was so non-linear that the stories were often left being incoherent . It 's tedious going through the same mini-quests over and over . Most of the characters could have been a good choice to have their own full game.This was a good idea , playing through multiple games where you meet up with past characters that you played , but the games needs a huge overhaul in order to give it more variety.If you have a LOT of time to kill and are very easily amused and find this game for very cheap , give it a whirl . Otherwise , find a decent game or play Final Fantasy VII for the 10th time . It will be much more interesting .	-1
Initially & quot ; Saga Frontier & quot ; is quite interesting , but unfortunately it quickly bogs down from there . The game offers seven different characters in seven different stories ( some of which are actually quite interesting ) ; this is a very neat idea , but the action gets repetitive after exploring the same area in different stories . The fight action is interesting at first , but this too gets repetitive in a rather short time . One thing I did like was the backgrounds ; some of them were just beautifully rendered . Unfortunately the character/monster graphics just did not fit in with the background ; they were two different styles that just did not mesh well with each other . If the game had offered a better combat engine and more unique areas for each character , & quot ; Saga Frontier & quot ; would have been a pretty good game .	-1
And that 's being generous . I 've never played a more lifeless , dull RPG . The dialogue comes off as if it was written by an autistic elementary schooler . I understand the sequel is supposed to be much better , but ... I 'm afraid I 've been scared off for good .	-1
This game was a real let-down for me . I really dislike the 3rd person camera . And it takes me forever to aim . I own all duke nukem games and this is the worst . Look for something else .	-1
So i bought this game , and when i recieved it , it was tucked away in a paper envelope , just the disk and nothing else ... ..and lo and behold , when i take it out , it has a huge crack in it making it unplayable , so not only did i have to pay for an unplayable copy of it , i had to pay for a brand new copy of it at $ 25 . I might review the game when i actually play it , but do n't buy it without a case , make sure when you order it , it comes in some kind of protective casing , not just a disk in a sleeveActual Game Review : Duke is still the man , even todayScore : 5 out of 5Ok , the only DN game i ever played fully was Duke Nukem Zero Hour , so i decided to try antoher one , and TTK seemed like a great choice since it resembled Zero Hour ... ..and it 's just as awesome , the weapons are amazing with my personal favorite being the shotgun and the level design is fun and not to repetitive . Graphics wise it 's not that bad , but it 's a PS1 game from 1996 , but graphics do n't make the game , look at Metal Gear or Resident Evil , and Duke Nukem is just as fun as those two . If you 're an action game fan , a Duke Nukem fan , or just want pure action , big explosions , bigger guns and Duke with an even bigger ego , check this game out .	-1
if you pay over 200.00 for the first dragoon game you need to understand its only 6 levels so dont spend that much when you can get it for 25.00 everywhere else	-1
I remember playing this game a few times with my friend . And then I asked him why did he get it ... .over and over . Batman Forever is based on the so so movie of the same name and as licensed games go , developers rush it out the door as soon as possible to make money . So that 's one of the many reasons why this game was n't so great.As some of the other reviewers have stated , this game used digitized graphics and controls made popular by Mortal Kombat at the time . So , it looks great for a SNES game and uses the Batman license . Unfortunately , everything else about the game sucked . Batman and Robin both move around like either tanks or robots . Basic things like walking and jumping are a chore to do . They each have special moves , which are set up like moves you perform in fighting games , except they rarely work . The enemies were super hard to beat and it seems every couple of minutes you see a loading screen ( you should NEVER wait for a game to load if it 's on a cartridge ! ) Add in the lack of save features or continues and you got a hard game that was n't meant to be played or beaten.Stay away from this crap even if you are tempted to buy it . It is n't worth it and it turned out to be WORSE than the bad movie it was based on .	-1
As the other reviews have stated , this is a very boring game . You are Batman or Robin set out to save Gotham from the Riddler and Twoface . An interesting thing to this game is that the buttons are set up like Mortal Kombat , high punch , low punch , up to jump and select to use your grappling hook . When you start each level you make a choice of two extra weapons like smoke bombs , gas guns and baterangs . There 's not much to the game , you move straight through on a set side scrolling platform path beating up bad guys . The graphics are pretty amazing , being that the game is so much like Mortal Kombat , so are the graphics !	-1
I reviewed this game a while back on the Genesis , and yeah its not one of the better Batman games that 's 4 sure ! With a few minor differences in sound and landscape design of the levels this game is almost identical to the Genesis version , and that being said your in for a lot of headaches.The set up of this game is very unique . The gameplay mechanics resemble something from Mortal Kombat or other fighting games , but its actually a walkthrough/beat-em up style action game though . You can choose as Batman or Robin , and of course with the option of having a 2 player mode as well . Like the Genesis version they use real live digitized footage of actors for the sprites in the game so it looks pretty good overall . That is also where a lot of the pros end on this game , the rest are cons ! First off its extremely hard not just because of the constant barrage of enemies you face but the controls I think may have been designed by a programmer with a really bad sense of humor ! The characters do not respond and sometimes feel glitchy and too perform the easiest of moves it takes a very odd button combination . So fighting the constant flow of enemies is super annoying and frustrating ! And also the SNES is known for having great soundtracks and sound quality in its games , not here , there are literally 2 tracks through out the game ! 0_oThe Adventures of Batman and Robin on The Sega Genesis is a great Batman game , and its port on the SNES is n't too shabby either , check out one of them but avoid this one !	-1
The digitized actors give the game an interesting visual style , and the levels/backgrounds bear a decent resemblance to certain sections of the movie . As someone who 's played a lot of Mortal Kombat I thought the controls were decent , but I can understand how frustrating gadget usage must be if you are n't used to inputting 'special move ' commands all the time.Really , the game just gets boring and repetitive after awhile . There 's not a lot to do except beat up thugs , and the 'loading ' that takes place between each room kills the momentum and gameplay flow . A lack of continues or save feature keeps you from wanting to jump back in when you die . And beyond the graphics in the levels , presentation is downright bad with bland elevator music and a weird batcomputer display that tries to move the narrative along . Plus what kind of game do you have when the manual does n't even list how to jump down between floors in a room ? ? 2-player co-op does make the game a bit better , until you either get stuck or get bored . Overall , another dud Batman licensed game .	-1
Please do not make the same mistake I did buying this game . The game play is terrible , graphics are bad , and there are tons of the gliche 's . I tried to resell and its worth 25 cents . enough said .	-1
They should 've made this game like the 2 before it . They just made it too complex and un donkey kong ya know what i mean ? Its ok at first , but it gets boring too fast . ( at least it 's not nearly as bad as DK64 )	-1
Does n't match the pic and I do n't remember any mention of this by the seller , Again European version . I 'm sure it would work on a European SNES .	-1
Why do I rate this game 1 star ? There are several reasons . First and foremost , there is NO SAVEPOINT . In short , you 'll have to beat this game in ONE SITTING . Talk about patience . The second major problem that I have with this game is that it is trying to do too much . It is a top-down shooter AND a first-person shooter . The graphics in the top-down mode are fine , but the graphics and textures in FP mode are DREADFUL . Doom has FAR better variety , texture-wise . Personally , I got headaches after playing in FP mode after 30 minutes -- and remember , you ca n't save . So the bottom line is this , if you want to kill dinosaurs , I 'd recommend Jurassic Park for the old NES and the Carnivores series for PC . N64 has a Turok the Dinosaur Hunter series out . Pass this game , you 'll be glad you did .	-1
the game came in and had another persons name in white out on it and didnt even work . waist of my cash .	-1
Do n't get me wrong , its an ok game , its kinda fun , at the same time I do n't see why this game is so amazing . The music is suppose to be good , I thought it did n't do the SNES sound chip any justice . Gameplay is quite repetitive , I know a lot of games can be repetitive but its a repition that bores me . Your constantly locating stuff , that got boring . But I will say , if I was bored or just killing time before I go out it would be good for a few rounds to play . The story line is pretty impressive , so I guess the game deserves props in that area . The game is good in its own little ways , but I just do n't rank it up there with some of the other classics . I have some friends that love this game , so I guess I respect it for what it is .	-1
Please do n't get extremist on me , but I do n't really like this game . It 's overrated and I will stick to the first Legend of Zelda that 's way better than this ! Newer Zelda games are NOT my thing .	-1
( This review was updated on July 10th , 2006 ) I 've changed my mind about Super Mario World and actually think it deserves 4 stars . I was just in a bad mood when I originally gave the game a 2-star rating . It turns out Super Mario World is not just a game you can enjoy growing up in the early 90 's . It actually has a lot of replay value and years later our children can enjoy Super Mario World the same way WE did.I still stand by what I say in the original review : `` The Donkey Kong Country series , for example , came along with a similar idea and made it more exciting IMO , so , if I were you I 'd go with one of those games instead of Super Mario World . For the most part the levels in the DKC series feel different from each other ( plus , they feel more creative and memorable ) . Unfortunately , many of the levels in Super Mario World are all basically the same and , as a result , I feel exhausted after playing the game for two hours.To put it another way- in Super Mario World it feels like you 're going through the levels simply to collect coins and extra lives . In the Donkey Kong Country series , you pretty much do the same thing ( except bananas instead of coins ) but it seems like the DKC series offers more creativity in the level design , which allows you to look forward to each stage and think to yourself `` I wonder what cool thing I get to do in THIS stage '' . It 's not like that in Super Mario World . `` I still believe that , but I 've recently come to change my mind a little and think that , even though most of the levels in Super Mario World feel the same , that 's not necessarily a BAD thing . I also do n't think the graphics in SMW are as nice as many reviewers think . They sort of look blocky but , to their credit , Nintendo games have always had plenty of pretty colors , which is a plus.So go ahead and buy Super Mario World if you want to experience the joy of old-school Mario ( the games MY generation grew up with ) . After all , it 's Mario and Mario games always have something decent going for them ( except Mario Is Missing , but with time we 've come to realize that game never even existed ! ) Super Mario World is basically Super Mario Bros. 3 ( but without all the cool Mario suits and less creative worlds ) . I like in Super Mario Bros. 3 how you have water , desert , air , plant and ice worlds ( in addition to more ) . In Super Mario World you just have UNUSUAL worlds such as Chocolate Island and Forest of Illusion . Those are n't as neat as the worlds in Super Mario Bros. 3 . Super Mario World should have been the best Mario game yet but Nintendo took a few steps back ( but with a MONSTER like Super Mario Bros. 3 I guess it would have been difficult to make a better Mario game right after it ) .Another problem in Super Mario World is that if you want to get a perfect score ( 96 ) you not only have to reach the goal in every single level , but you also have to find and grab a key in certain levels ( but not all levels have keys ) . This means you have to go through many levels a SECOND time . It 's sort of boring . Once is enough . The concept of collecting keys was n't a good one . I guess the good part is that if you are wearing a cape , you can quickly fly through the levels ( except for water levels , and any level where the screen pushes you to the right ) but that 's not fun either because all you do is continue flying and pushing the back button to stay up high in the air until you reach the goal ( or the key ) . However , at the end of the day none of this is really enough to make the game bad in any way . I just get tired of it.Go ahead and get it . Yes , it 's a classic .	-1
People say this game is great . To what extent ? its great horrendousness ? if that is the case , then yes . this game is so hard and cant be beat unless cheated after world 6 , the game is impossible . just stick with sonic on sega genesis . the graphics look like the NES , even genesis is better . just dont waste time with a snes console or games .	-1
This is one of the most overrated games of the Mario series . First of all , it 's extremely difficult and frustrating . There 's always been a problem with Mario games concerning the controls , they 're slippery and not responsive enough for the difficulty of the game . Also the fact that the only attack Mario can do is jump on his enemies , at least in this game which is n't enough arsenal for the amount of enemies that are set against you at one time ( armies of them ) . I know people who have been stuck on the same level for years and it makes me wonder why people bother with this game.Another dire problem is the process of saving your game . The game only lets you save at designated points instead of saving at the completion of each level which again makes this game seem frustrating when you complete a substantial amount of the game and suddenly die and get sent back five to eight levels for losing all your lives.I would 've given the game 2 stars for the graphics alone which look somewhat advanced for 1991 but there are so many games from the 16 bit era that surpassed it that I 'm going to ignore the graphics in this review because they simply do n't make up for its lack of detail and intuitiveness in everything else . In comparison to Donkey Kong Country and Sonic The Hedgehog 3 this game is dwarfed for its graphics . Another reason to overlook the graphics is the blending of levels in which the same type of level looks nearly identical to every level of its kind.And let 's not forget the overrated soundtrack . The music is dull , repetitive , and juvenile and not in good way . It 's not uncommon to hear the same music being played for three or more consecutive levels which is ridiculous because they did n't even do this on the NES.Now do n't get me wrong , I 'm a casual Nintendo fan who immensely enjoyed other games on the Super Nintendo and Nintendo games on newer consoles , Super Mario World is n't one of them because it 's frustrating and it sucks .	-1
This game has great graphics , an excellent 16-bit redo of the original soundtrack , and an overall awesome game . But after the famous title sequence ended and the game started , I was left in frustration . Level one put me against thousands of dinosaurs , scorpions , and worms . After 30 unsuccessful minutes , I used the flawed Game Genie ram editor to give myself invincibility , and level 1 became a snap . Level two started . I was put in mode 7 with a land speeder , not good considering the age of the game . The clunky land speeder vehicle could hardly aim at the Jawas , and once I shot all 10 of them I zoomed towards the sand crawler . Level 3 begins . It was an awful platformer with enemies that knock you back to the ground . Luke ca n't even jump high enough to reach half the platforms . Even with the Genie granting my wishes , it was still an impossible mess ! ! !	-1
O.k . I 'll put it out right now and bring the big guns , ... combined could n't even compete with the `` hint of mint '' of this game.Zoop was terrible . It was supposed to be the new Tetris and it turned out to be the new garbage of the day . Zoop was everywhere . It was in every magazine , every commercial and every home system yet the game still flopped because of it 's horrid gameplay.You were a little triangle . Your job ... match colors and shapes before a row of colors touches you ... Oh by the way , that 's all there is to this game . How fun right ? Of course not . Zoop was the biggest hype and also the biggest flop ever , or atleast that I can personally think of off hand . Honestly , it was n't even worth playing . If you wanted to get frustrated all night long playing a game , then all you needed to do was pop in Zoop and then you could be angry all night long.Do not play , buy or even look at a screen shot of Zoop . It 'll destroy your brain and erase all of your known gaming abilities for other games . Avoid it !	-1
This was a fad , where they were hoping to be the next Tetris and they came out on every system and every platform , people were hooked on matching colors of triangles with squares , then the people playing this game got bored of it and it was never heard from again . The point is that you must select a triangle from the middle of the screen and point it toward an isle of squares and shoot it off to destroy the squares . If too many squares get lined up , you lose ! ! !	-1
its boring you play a triangle trying to poke balls into a square	-1
In this game , all you do is line up the colors and clear blocks using the color you , a triangle , have at the current time . If the blocks get to the square you are in , the game ends . Another thing that gets me is that this game lacks a 2-Player Mode . Do not even bother with this game .	-1
I had a friend who used to come over and make fun of me for owning Killer Instinct . He 'd constantly ask me `` when are you going to get rid of this crappy game ? '' and I 'd tell him `` oh , eventually '' . But it took until 2001 when the game did n't sell at a yard sale that I ended up throwing it in the trashbin . THAT is when I got rid of it for good.The fighting in Killer Instinct is even worse than in Mortal Kombat , and I did n't think it was possible to defeat Mortal Kombat in sheer crappiness . The one thing Killer Instinct does better than MK is the combo system . It 's easier and more enjoyable to unleash combos to your opponent in this game . Unfortunately , just like Mortal Kombat , the fighting system is severely dated and useless by todays standards . Unless you like your fighting games to be in slow-motion along with neverending choppy graphics ( with bad-looking fatalities included for additional pain- pain that YOU feel ) you should never ever think about buying this game . Just another Super NES fighting game I hope people ca n't remember .	-1
I never got into the hype of Mortal Kombat when it came out in arcades ; it was good on arcade while the game lasted and then shipped to SEGA and SNES . Playing it on SNES was pretty boring for me for three reasons . One was the lack of blood . It was probably the most interesting feature of the arcade game . Two was the controller problem . I could never get a lot of moves done the way I asked for . Three was the sheer boredom of it . The game is very one dimensional for me . There is not much to do except memorize the combo moves for each player and then the fatality move . After them , there is nothing else anymore . The tournament is interesting , but once the ladder is climbed to the top , that 's it . There is n't much to be said . All in all , Mortal Kombat does n't cut it for me .	-1
Mortal Kombat was really weak on the SNES because it was so censored . No blood , some people had different fatalities ( ex : Johnny Cage 's foot in your stomach ) . Blood was traded for sweat ( ? ! ? ! ) and because of those 2 reasons , the game was truly brought down a notch.Yes it 's still a classic but it 's not worth it on SNES . You 're better off getting it on the SEGA system because that way you could overcome the censorship and at least put in a & quot ; blood code & quot ; .Personally , I 'd skip this one anyday and go straight to MK II because that was just all out better than MK and it was a lot more enjoyable , had better replay and a lot more characters . Trust me , skip MK on SNES and go straight for MK II on SNES .	-1
When Mortal Kombat 1 was released on the arcades nearly a decade ago , it immediately became a HUGE hit . It was so realistic , and the hand-to-hand combat style was so extreme . The game also centered around controversy due to the incredibly unique violent content . Fans anxiously awaited for the game 's arrival on home video game consoles . When it was released to the Super Nintendo , fans wasted no time purchasing it . However , the happy fans were quickly disappointed when they discovered Mortal Kombat to be edited . Thanks to Acclaim and Nintendo , this game has NO blood & amp ; guts ! The fatalities are edited and toned down . The blood has been changed to sweat . MK fans were ripped off and very angry about the censorship in the game . At least the Sega Genesis version of MK had a blood code . The Super Nintendo version plays a lot like the arcade hit . The graphics , sound , music , and animation play equivelant to the arcade . But without the bloody violence and original fatalities , it 's just not the same . This is still an okay fighting game though , which is why I gave it two stars instead of one . Too bad it 's so old . I could do without it . MK II and MK III are a heck of a lot better . Do n't waste your money on this . Rent it if you can .	-1
Because you need something like that to make this game interesting and enjoyable ; because its that bad ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Seriously this game sucks , the graphics were great for the 16-BIT , the sound is n't all that bad , and that 's were it stops . The gameplay is full of glitches and other issues . There is no blood , though you 'll see a lot of sweat , maybe some tears , but no blood . You ca n't leave that out of the deal , also the game was just censored to death . The combination of the bad gameplay , and lack of originality that should have come from the arcades killed this version ! I remember you could trip someone half way across the screen ! ? ; ( Its just a dumb game.If you wan na make it good like I said in the begining get some beer and other things , possibly get drunk , and then maybe you might find it entertaining . Other than that avoid this one , but check out the sequel .	-1
I missed the original Mortal Kombat in arcades , and was introduced to the series through word-of-mouth about how violent the title was . Really if this was the only version I 'd played , I would 've never gussed what all the hype was about.Graphics and audio are pretty good , far surpassing what the Genesis version was offering and staying pretty true to the arcade version . Gameplay however , is a failure . Nevermind that the fatalities have been changed and the blood turned to sweat - the actual fighting is stiff and unresponsive , and it feels like the fighters have their feet glued to the floor . The only move that works well here is Scorpion 's spear , and it 's so smooth in its execution that it becomes the best way of landing cheap hits.Look at MK objectively : bad controls , less characters than Street Fighter , less moves , a limited number of environments with no background animation ( though the Pit idea was rather cool ) . The first installment was truly one that sold based on the strength of its gore , and on the SNES we 're deprived of that as well.MK fans might or might not want this version for completion purposes ( since it looks graphically like the arcade but removes all the violent content ) . Everyone else should jump to MKII , which really got the series started .	-1
He 's a basketball player , yet Shaquille O'Neal made it so big with his basketball career that he thought that he could expose his name in the mid 90's.Shaq Dieselanyone ? That was hilarious . Now look what Shaq came up with : a fighting game . Just by having the biggest name on the front of the cover tells enough what the quality of this game really comes out to.The video game consists of bad punchline dialog before the fights , a plot that 's just predictable and stupid , lame graphics , and controls that are so agonizing to handle that it 's just completely pointless.This game was voted one of the worst fighting games for a reason . No need to waste your time on this when there are far superior games released on the SNES with much better plots and controls .	-1
This was the worst fighting game on the SNES system . Even worse than the home version of SNK 's ART OF FIGHTING and FIGHTER 'S HISTORY . The game is not only stupid , it 's easy and the characters are really lame.Granted yes , this game was released when Shaquille was really , really big in the mainstream , but after this game , notice how things started to go bad for him . After all , he did KA-ZAAM . But anyway , the controls are bad , the graphics are bad , fights are really predictable ( ex : you know what the computer is going to do ) and all in all not a fun game.Seriously , SNES had all of the better fighting games so I 'm sure you could find one that you like because there are several to choose from . For instance , STREET FIGHTER II series ( New Challengers , Hyper , etc ) , MORTAL KOMBAT II and ULTIMATE MORTAL KOMBAT , FATAL FURY 2 SPECIAL and even BALLZ . Skip SHAQ FU , it 's a waste of your time .	-1
Legendary basketball player Shaquille O'Neil is in Tokyo as he goes into a Chinese store where an old man whisks you away into another dimension where you must combat enemies like a cat-lady , a mummy and other baddies.One of the worst games of all time ! this game is a complete disaster that i remembered thinking the game has an odd yet wacky concept as it has to be fun and rented it from one of my local video stores . The music is ok and the graphics are cartoony but this game has lousy controls that feel like they have been busted , you keep getting killed without a fair chance.No wonder this has been a waste of rental money for those that rented it , in fact there is a site that is dedicated to destroying this horrible abomination of a game . It 's as bad as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde , X-Men for NES and E.T . for Atari .	-1
Yes cause he 's f**king you over rather ya like it or not . The controlls are not very good but you know this is a bad game when your storyline is I stumbled upon a Dojo an old man says fight for me this was made when Shaq was with the Magic so the old man says you are the magic 1 so you fight a cat huminoid a boogger Sheets a dude from Aku Locka Polkistan a chick who uses voodoo guess what her name is Voodoo Beast and the boss Sett Ra a boss so stupid he would even be passable for a Killer Instinct character . M Bison and Shao Khan were better Bosses cheap but beatable and your attacks are difficult to pull off but everybody attacks you and there specials are more powerful this would have been a decent arcade game but but play it for 2 player mode and the bad 1 liners at the end of everty fight . Good game if you need a good laugh .	-1
This is one of those SNES games that makes me wonder how hardcore gamers were back in the 90 's . It 's freakin impossible . The idea is hilarious , but Shaq has terrible moves , and everyone else has amazing moves , and super intelligent AI.Do n't pay too much for this game , but it 's good for a few laughs .	-1
It all happens as soon as you read the title , the acid in your stomache just churns up.Shaq Fu was one of those gaming horrors of the 90 's that should have never been , just like his awful , awful movie career.I feel like my intelligence decreased after playing it , but back then I was but a mere child and I loved fighting games ( as well as RPG 's ) . As such I was easily sucked into playing any fighter that rolled out of a factory , thank god I had only rented this mediocre title.The graphics were pretty good I 'll admit , but then there was Shaq to remind me that I was playing an absolute piece of crap . The characters clobber each other with puns before a battle ensues , oh dear god ! ! After your brain is crushed from the weight of sheer bad humor the fight starts . At this point you take a deep breath and think `` Well at least that 's over ... '' . That is if you have n't gotten to the point where your thinking `` ! $ @ @ & % * @ ! ! ^ $ $ # ... . '' and believe me I 'll understand if you have.If you 've lasted this long then ... .I PITY YOUR SOUL ! ! Anyways , the fight starts and it 's incredibly easy ... to the point that enjoyment is null and the fact that your playing Shaq Fu does n't help cure that sudden acid reflux problem either . I beat it in about 20 minutes *yawn* ( or was it *urk* I forgot ... ) .I beg of anyone that 's even considering buying this or god forbid , even playing this PLEASE ! ! ! Your not missing a thing , in fact you 'll thank me and anyone else that has a similar opinion on the matter . Playing a great 2-D fighter like Samurai Showdown or Street Fighter II is far better than having prematurely gray hair and vomit all over your favorite shirt ( and being mentally scarred ) .If you own this game , there 's an easy cure . Either melt it in a fire or throw it in the sea or anything that makes it dissapear from existance , please do n't sell this game to anyone . It 's an insult that this game was even made .	-1
I love Shaq Fu , and I do n't care what anybody else thinks.It 's just so bad , that it 's good.Funny characters , terrible ridiculous story ... it 's great.This game has become something of a cult classic , but the SNES version is very watered down compared to the Genesis game.It is missing characters , backgrounds and a few other things as well.The storyline is pretty much the same , but since characters are missing , some of the storyboards will be missing too , through the story mode.Graphics and sound are a bit better than the Genesis version , since this IS on SNES , plus the controls are easier , although that would n't really matter , just as long as your using a six button controller on the Genesis.Overall , if you love a good laugh at something awful , enjoy the FULL experience and get Shaq Fu for Sega Genesis instead .	-1
This game is regularly voted as one of the worst video games of all time ( if not THE worst ) , and I wo n't argue with that , but I think that the game is actually strangely fascinating . It 's so bad it 's actually comical ! In fact , it 's even almost like it was intended to be that way ( although I 'm sure it was n't ) . The game has a storyline that makes minus zero sense . The way it starts is , Shaq is in Japan before a charity basketball game , and he comes to this karate dojo ( by the way , there is a bit of prominent Pepsi product placement [ how 's that for alliteration ? ] here ) , where an old man informs him that he ( Shaq , that is ) is the Magic One , and that he ( again , Shaq ) must go into another dimension to rescue some kid named Nezu . Then Shaq goes through this portal into the other dimension . The story begs multitudinous questions , and never answers a single one ( unless I 've missed or forgotten something , or more than one thing ) . Some examples : Just why is Shaq ( the `` Magic One '' ) the ONLY one who can rescue Nezu ? Why ca n't anyone else do it ? Why was Nezu kidnapped in the first place ? Why is there a portal to the other dimension inside the dojo ? How does the old man know that Shaq is the Magic One ( that is , the one who must rescue Nezu ) ? This next question does n't really have so much to do with the story , but just exactly how do you pronounce `` Nezu '' ? ( `` NEZ-oo '' ? `` NEE-zoo '' ? `` NAY-zoo '' ? ) If I tried to list all of the questions that the storyline ( and other things in the game ) make me ask , the list would probably go on for miles before I finished it ! As for the actual `` game '' part , I really do n't think that it looks or sounds that bad ( although MANY other games , including other SNES games , have done MUCH better ) . I would n't say that the controls are that good , though . Your opponents are really bizarre -- - a catlady , a mummy ( who is the main bad guy ) , and assorted other weirdos . Before each match , you and your opponent engage in a bit of smack talking -- - bad smack talking , at that . It seems that your opponents all have much better moves than you do ; they can whip your butt in no time . I find it odd that Shaq has no basketball-related moves ; should n't he at least have the ability to throw basketballs at his opponents ? ( By the way , get a load of the mummy guy 's name : Sett Ra . Those who are familiar with ancient Egyptian deities , or at least their names , will probably get a laugh out of that . ) And , for those of you who may not want the ending of the game spoiled , SKIP THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH ! The game ends as ridiculously as it begins ( almost ) . Shaq returns to Earth ( with Nezu ) in time for that charity basketball game -- - and who is there at the game but Shaq 's enemies from the other dimension ( or at least a couple of them , anyway ) . Then Shaq dishes out a little more smack talk , and that 's it.Overall , a supremely cheesy game . It really makes no sense that Shaq is even on the game . The game indeed appears to have been mainly just a cheap attempt to cash in on Shaq 's ( then- ) celebrity , as he was very big at the time ; making a truly good game ( let alone one where Shaq 's presence actually makes sense ) does n't seem to have been a priority . If you like games with storylines that make actual sense ( any sense at all ) , this definitely is n't one of those games . If you like games that play really well , this is n't one of those games , either . But if you just want a game that is good for a few laughs ( even if that was unintentional ) , this game might work for you , though it certainly is n't worth paying much for .	-1
I think the game play is great the music was good but the main thing that made me give this a low rating are none other than the lacking of the graphics they are absolutely horrible and it makes it really hard to see where you going sometimes.Well thats all I got to say , This game would have been great if it were n't for the attrocious graphics and I think the PC version was alot better .	-1
Next to Sega CD the worst version of DOOM . The graphics suck and you can barely tell what anything is , the sound is decent ( the one star ) , the controls are horrid , the gameplay is horrid and the shores of hell freezes up on start , so all you really have is a butchered port of Knee Deep & Inferno with horrid controls . Terrible .	-1
First of all , Here are the PROS and CONSPROS : Good for the people who own a SNES , not PC.CONS : really bad graphics.slower animation than PC.you ca n't save the game.It is shorter than the PC version of doom.Overall : 0.9This is a pretty good game , but not for SNES ! Get it on PC . That version is alot better .	-1
not that this game is bad , but it is hard to play on Console , because PC makes everything so much easier for games like this . I would recommend playing this game , but on the PC not the SNES . 2 stars for this one .	-1
Trust me , the Super NES version of Super Wrestlemania is awful in every sense of the word . The way the wrestlers *very* slowly walk across the screen JUST to deliver a simple generic wrestling move to your opponent ( because the game company did n't give any of the wrestlers many moves to work with ) is worse than any kind of pain you can imagine.I ca n't believe anyone would consider buying this game , unless they had personal childhood memories attached to it and they were buying it BACK after giving it away or something . The one thing it has going for it is the selection of legendary wrestlers . Once you select one of those wrestlers and actually play the game , you 're in for a nasty snail-pace surprise . So bad , so boring , so forgettable .	-1
Super Wrestlemania was pretty good back in 1991 , but later SNES WWF games were much better and made this one look second-rate . The graphics were decent , the sound was okay ( future WWF SNES games improved on both graphics and sound ... Royal Rumble and Raw had very good music for a SNES game , and Raw actually had a decent intro [ similar to the WWF Monday Night Raw 's 1993-1994 opening for the TV show ] ) , but where it really lacks is it features just a few modes of play : singles match ( player vs computer or player vs player ) and tag team match ( one player vs computer , one player vs another player , and two players together vs computer ) ... you wo n't find any tournament modes in this one , so you wo n't be able to go for the World Wrestling Federation Championship ( the REAL world heavyweight title , slappy ! ) . Future SNES WWF games allow you to go for the gold ( WWF World title in Royal Rumble , and both WWF World title and WWF Tag title in WWF Raw ) . You 'd be better off with either Royal Rumble or Raw .	-1
LJN was a subsidiary of Acclaim Entertainment created to make more games for the NES and it continued into the SNES/Genesis era . One of their first games they released for the SNES was WWF Super Wrestlemania in 1992 . While it was great to see a game with the WWF license , it only turned out to be a forgettable wrestling game that sorely lacked content and variety.WWF Super Wrestlemania lets you take control of one out of eight wrestlers . From there , you can choose to play a one player game to go against the computer , a 2 player vs. game to go against another player or a tag team mode where you and another player take on a computer controlled tag team . Whoever pins the other person first is the winner of the match . That 's pretty much the entire game . There is nothing else to do but to tweak the options before or after the match.The PROS : For its time , the graphics and sounds were top notch . The controls were simple enough so it does n't take long before you pull off punches , kicks , body slams and jumping off from the top rope . The wrestlers look good enough that you recognize them . Finally , 2 player support means you can take on a friend anytime you wanted when you get tired of playing against the computer.The CONS : The problems here are few but bothersome . First off , you only have 8 wrestlers and that is a small selection to choose from . Second , the game modes are scarce : there are n't any main story or tournament modes to play through . One player , 2 player vs. and tag team modes are no different from each other . Even though they look like the real wrestlers , the in-game wrestlers do n't have any of their trademark moves . They all move the same and have the same basic moves so it did n't matter which wrestler you play with . Then there is the ring you fight in . There 's only one ring you fight in . The crowd cheers for you in the background but it loops constantly so it will eventually get on your nerves . At this point , the game starts to get very repetitive with no real purpose other than to fight over and over again . Clearly , LJN just wanted this game out there since there were new gaming consoles that people were buying at the time.It was fun playing this game for a while but afterwards , it got boring . The lack of game modes , variety in the rings and the absence of trademark moves for the wrestlers just makes WWF Super Wrestlemania feel like a generic wrestling game without any of the things that mirrored the World Wrestling Federation at the time . If you 're looking for a good SNES wrestling game , get Royal Rumble instead .	-1
The original Wrestlemania was in no way at all a good game . It was boring , slow and every wrestler had the same exact moves and more or less looked the same.Wrestlemania was n't meant to be a stand out game . I think it was meant to be the beginning of something else because after this came WWF Royal Rumble and WWF Raw which some of us plated to death.I would surpass this one and go straight to either WWF Royal Rumble or WWF RAW .	-1
THE GAME IS SLOW AND THERE IS NO WRESTLING MOVES.BUT YOU GET OUTSIDE THE RING ACTION WITH ANY WRESTLER.PS IF YOU WANT WRESTLING GET WWF RAW OR THE ROYAL RUMBLE FOR SNES .	-1
Well , I guess the title for this review should essentially sum up the game . This game featured some of the greatest names in pro wrestling in the late 80 's and early 90 's . Hulk Hogan , Randy Savage , Shawn Michaels , The Undertaker , Hawk and Animal The Legion of Doom , Earthquake and Typhoon the Natural Disasters , The Million Dollar Man Ted Dibiase and Sid Justice make up quite an impressive roster for a wrestling game made during that era . I will concede that Bret `` The Hitaman '' Hart not being in the game is kind of a snub , but it does not matter since the game is lousy.There is the typical one-on-one match-up as well as Tag Team match-up , and even a Survivor Series elimination match . But the biggest flaw is the fact that there are no finishers . You wo n't see Hogan 's leg drop , Savage 's flying elbow , Earthquake 's butt-splash or the Doomsday Device . It is just a simple finger-blistering grapple war , and no tournament or campaign mode means that there is no real reason to play more than a single match of the game , nor is there any point to selecting a character.The sound is the typical recycled grunts and slams on the mat . While the music is halfway decent , that 's about the only redeeming factor . These flaws would be fixed in the sophomoric attempt Royal Rumble . This title , however , was best avoided then back in the day , and now as well .	-1
The fact that those two wrestlers are n't in this version of WWF Wrestlemania : The Arcade Game is reason enough to avoid it . Yoko Zuna is a big guy with very powerful moves , and Bam Bam is yet another big guy . It 's odd how they did n't include either of the two BIG guys on the Super NES . It 's not like this game has a lot of options and wrestlers anyway , so to take away two wrestlers and leave you with only six is just ridiculous . Get the Playstation version .	-1
This game is crazy . In every possible meaning of the word . I mean nothing about this game make sense . Infact I 'll bet you anything , in the remotest parts of Southeast Asia , playing this game is considered the number one form of execution . The gameplay is childish & cartoony . Some of the moves in the game you ca n't do in real life like doing a perfect piledriver on a super-heavy-weight like Yokozuna . The game speed is so fast that you think it was high on sugar . When a wrestler punches another wrestlers , stuff comes out of that guy like when you punch Yokozuna so many times fishes fly out of his pants . All the wrestlers fly so high you think they were on speed or something like that . This makes The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon look sane by comparison . The only GOOD thing about this game is that the wreslters look like the wrestlers in real life but that 's still not enough to save this game . I give this `` game '' a 1 out of 10 .	-1
Given the pre-release hype from game sites , I was really anticipating this game as the contender for the best RTS this year . I 'm pretty disappointed.The good first : The game looks very nice . It has that same techno-organic look as Battlezone 2 , not surprising since the same guys did it . It runs fairly nice , aside from the crashes . The framerate and overall running is probably the smoothest I 've ever seen on a 3D RTS , even Homeworld . The interface is also quite well thought out , and a step forward over other 3D RTS 's , particularly the ease of camera movement.Other than that , the game is a dog . Sorry , fanboys , but I have to call it like I see it . Gameplay is a real snoozer : Tons of dicking around and not much combat . Everything is just deliberately slow -- aircraft move as slowly as infantry on foot , et cetera . If you are looking for fast , furious , exciting gameplay , this is not the place to find it.The unit pathfinding is set up in such a way that they all move one at a time so that they do n't obstruct each other . Thus , you 'll move one unit , and if any others are in its way they will all , agonizingly , move one at a time to new positions so the mover can get through . In any movement of groups this problem is ten times as bad . You 'll watch in frustration as your units get ripped to shreds while they stupidly maneuver into position before they start returning fire.No real story is going on here ; there are no characters and nothing happens inside of a mission to alter the plot . There are some vague cutscenes between the missions , but they 're so irrelevant that you could have just played the missions and made up your own story to string them together.Overall , I regret having bought the game . I ca n't recommend it unless you 're compelled to get an RTS fix .	-1
I sadly remember the day when this game was released . I had waited long enough , and finally I had the game in my hands . I remember being so excited until about 1 hour into the game . It was then that I realized that this game was terrible.The graphics were nice , and the cut scenes were above average . The voices sounded good , and the combat was a little fast , but adequate.But I was n't having fun . I realized that the game was pretty deep , and dwelling deeper into the game 's cool storyline would require more of the bad AI , terrible - I mean HORRIBLE combat system , and scrappy mouse driven interface . I could n't take it anymore . I wished I could just watch the game instead of play it , then I would of been happy.I did what I had to do , and finally uninstalled it . I thought of all the money I spent , and went to find another game . What a tradgedy that a game with that much potential had to be ruined by an obvious rushed product . If your a gamer who likes fast action and addicting gameplay , then go buy Icewind Dale or Diablo 2 , not this game .	-1
I am a huge fan of vampire fiction in any form and also enjoy a good RPG . So I was ecstatic when I heard about Vampire being translated from the pen-and-paper sources to the computer . And Vampire is an amazing looking game that I really wanted to like . Unfortunately some bad design choices and poor features prevented it from happening.I 'll start with the good points . The graphics are stunningly amazing . The animation of the characters is fluid and weapons are superbly done . The lighting greatly enhances the dark and sinister atmosphere . I kept going in many places because I wanted to see what area I would visit next . The camera control is also very smooth and easy to manipulate with the mouse . The gameplay is actually fun for the first bit of the game while you are adventuring by yourself and with one other party member . The source material and the manual add a lot to this game . Wandering around towns and seeing people milling about made it feel alive . And it was always oh so fun to feed upon someone to refill your blood level.The RPG system is also great . There are several positive and detrimenatl traits for the characters . A certain level of blood must be maintained to use the disciplines ( spells/skills ) and to keep your character from succombing to frenzy . Experience points can be distributed among such traits as strength , dexterity , intelligence , willpower and several others . Very nicely done indeed.Here is where I have to get in to the demerits of this game . First off , the voice acting is not very good ; but it 's not the worst I 've heard either . And the sequences of dialogue are long and boring . The characters simply stand in place and wave their hands about . NPC interaction is left to a few choices which really have little baring on the outcome of the game . Nothing as rich and detailed as Planescape : Torment.The combat , while fun and reminiscent of Diablo , only keeps its spark for the first part of the game . Most of it consists of clicking on an enemy and waiting until you 've hit them enough times for them to die . A big flaw that becomes noticable during the first few levels is that the enemies wait until you are in range before they attack . They will simply stand idle as you slaughter others in the same room ! As the game progresses you will gain party members , and will bemoan similarly incompetant AI . I equipped one with a bow and laughed in disbelief as he continuously fired in to a wall when he should have moved a couple steps to the side before doing so . Also , you can control the other members of your party in combat , but the main character will stop fighting while you are doing so ! Aaahhhh ! Add to this that you can go through entire areas and clean up with little to no problem , but then come across certain areas that will be nigh impossible to pass . Both enemies and your fellow party members will get hung up on walls , doors and other obstacles in the room.And here we come to the worst sin of the game , the save system . Saving is automatically handled when you transition between levels are areas . The only other way to save is to be in your haven or safe area . One can get there by using the Walk the Abyss discipline ( aka spell/skill ) . But it takes a while before you have one of these in a given area . So we are left hacking our way back through areas and levels already completed . I found myself abusing the autosave feature by running back and forth between levels to save . But what if more than one person is playing the game as is the case on my computer ? It 's pretty much tough luck . This is a computer game , not a console . The game should have been balanced so that players could save anywhere at anytime.The multiplayer sounds enticing with the ability for one person to take control of the NPCs and monsters . But if the gameplay is similar to the single-player then I ca n't see it being much better.With great graphics , a rich source material and so much potential . It makes me sad to not be able to like this game . This takes me back to Revenant , another game with a lot of potential but came up flacid . Maybe the patches will fix the problems , I certainly hope so . But much has to be done for the AI to make this game worthy .	-1
How many times do we have to tell game designers that game saves are an integral part of any game . Game designers , this is a PC game you 're designing and not a console game . Let 's start with the bad points as Im sure all the readers would like to read first . The game committed the most sinful act of not providing a save game feature accessible anytime and anywhere in the game . You could only save the game when it loads a new scene or level . I was in a dungeon for 2 hours ( real-time ) , dying , and I couldnt save the game because you have to walk out of the dungeon to make the game reload the level and save your points . This is crazy ! This is an RPG we 're playing here . I mean , Final Fantasy III ( console game ) had built in save points in the dungeons . Why cant a PC game like this have one ? This is a real turn-off . Next is the interface . I still have to figure out how to properly move the character . It 's so hard to control the camera as you move the character in the game . The view pans out then suddenly pans in . The game tried to make its interface unique and it ended up making the game more complex . Graphics are good . Nice colors , voice acting was ok. You need a good sized system though to run this game like a PIII 600 and 32mb video card . Story : well , this game completely ignored the pen and paper version with too many battles in it . I beat the game in 30 hours . So there really isnt much there to expect . Will you buy this game ? I say , dont buy it until they patch the game with a save feature . If you 're after a RPG , then look somewhere else .	-1
I recieved my pre ordered copy of STV Elite force today and I have already played through the game . I will share some of my impressions with you.The story is fairly entertaining , though the gameplay does n't let you do anything but exactly what you are supposed to . You can not just wander around the ship and explore except for a few rooms at a time . The level of detail missing is fairly disappointing.The enemies nearly always shoot for you , even when there are other crew members in your team.The enemies are very stupid and easy to kill most of the time.The maps leave no room for error in navigation . You are directed to the next phase of the map because that is the only way you can go . This gets old after a while.Some of the exits from the rooms are frustratingly hard to figure out , which is not only boring in my opinion , but also takes away from the enjoyment of the game by drawing out the mission unnecessarily.The weapons are ok , pretty standard first person shooter fare.Some of the voices are badly done . Seven of Nine 's voice especially . It does n't even sound like the actor that plays her in the TV show most of the time . I have my doubts she did the voice for the game.If you have played Soldier of Fortune , also by Activision , this game will not be all that exciting . The characters in the game move exactly like they do in SOF . Dying Borg do that silly spinning fall just like the guys in SOF did . They could have at least done some animation work that was original in this game.Neelix is way too tall and looks dumb.The levels and savegames are frustratingly slow to load . A loading image comes up in the lower left hand side of the screen and just does n't seem to go very fast ( I 'm running a P3 500 with 128mb of Ram and a 32mb video card in case you wondered ) .The scenes in between the gameplay are pretty well done but tend to be drawn out and uninformative at times.All things considered this is a 'just ok ' game . If you have played SOF you will find this fairly similar and not quite as fun probably . If you have n't played SOF then you should , and not this because SOF is more fun . If you are a Trekkie looking for some interaction ( though basic and very juvenille ) you will find some here and thus probably like this game just from the fantasy aspect . If you just like killing computer conrolled enemies and are looking for a fairly mindless shooting game this is your baby.Two stars because , like I said , this is Soldier of Fortune in space .	-1
This is a semi-decent game . It will keep your attention for about 2 hours . Basically you play the Federation , Klingon , Borg or Romulans . You control ship production and deployment . Of course there is mining and resource management . For the most part this is basically Star Craft with Star Trek ships . The graphics are mediocre and the AI is horrible . The AI doesnt re-build once you destroy the enemy bases . I would wait on this game until it goes into the sale bin ( and it will head there fast ) . This could have been a really promising game , the ship designs and attributes are ok-and I like the feature of being able to transport troops onto enemy ships and then take it over . Aside from that , there really isnt anything special about this game.Thumbs down !	-1
I was unimpressed with this game . The races are too similar to each other . The ships within each race do not differ much except in size . Mouse control is painfully sluggish . Space is two-dimensional - ... Resource collection is uncreative . Several ship classes are missing , such as the Intrepids . Only 8 ships can be selected at a time . Whether I played the Borg or the Federation , I got the feeling that I was just building the same things with different graphics in a [ copy ] of Starcraft.Generally , a rather half-hearted effort at a real-time strategy game . It 's not bad , really , it 's just that there are much better games out there . Like Armada II .	-1
this game is too old to work on todays OS 's . After many attempts with dos-box and other emulation software I gave up.I did however get it to start ... once ... .but it locked up and pixelated , then crashed with a fatal error .	-1
Do not even assume for a moment that Star Trek : Armada has any resemblance to Relic 's Homeworld , the two are about as closely related as Woody Allen is to Arnold Schwarzengger . First off , it has the longest install process of any game I have ever played , and I have a 48x CD-ROM drive . Second , the interface is monstrous , even though it looks elegant and simple . While positioning ships is easy , ( and it should be since they only move in 2 dimensions ) , there is no real sense of scale , plus they have a tendency to ` bump ' into objects like space stations and other ships . Secondly , the instant they see an enemy ship , any vessel you control within weapons ' range automatically opens fire , taking interaction down a notch . Also unlike Homeworld the user can not assign formations to his ships , making dispersement messy.When the game starts the user is treated to a rather nicely rendered opening scene with lots of fleet action between Federation , Klingon , Romulan and Borg vessels that culminates on an all-out run on Borg Cubes . ( Though one wonders how Picard can face down Locutus since they are the same guy . Did the Borg clone Picard ? ) Unfortunately , the game does n't deliver anywhere near the excitement generated by a 3 minute opening segue . At the title screen you have a choice to play a series of missions as either the Federation , Klingon , Romulan and Borg and they all must be played before arriving at the finale mission . Overall , the game seems to have been slapped together to capitalize on the franchise , lacking both the quality and substance that LucasArts has put into their Star Wars line of games . Armada lacks the epic scope of similar games like Homeworld or even Starcraft . If you changed the space scapes to ground and the starships to Zerg or Protoss units , Armada would be Starcraft , except not as much fun.Armada prolongs the Star Trek game curse when it should have shattered it . The prospect of moving a fleet of Defiant and Sovereign class starships around the screen should have been an easy game to create . Perhaps if Activision had optioned the Homeworld engine for Armada , things would have been different . However , on the upside , the rendered starships do look nice , as does the 3D lighting for all of the effects shots . Getting Patrick Stewart , Michael Dorn , and Denise Crosby to do voices will probably get die-hard Trek fans to purchase the game to feed their pirana-like frenzy for franchise merchandise , but style should never win out over substance in a game like this . There is very little meat to this game.Do yourself a favor , power up your warp engines and get away from this title , as fast as you can .	-1
Hey I 'm a bit of a Trekkie , but this games is something of a ( terrible ) dissapointment . Is it just me , or are a lot of people trying to make money utilizing the magnificent star trek universe ? Do n't waste your money on this : (	-1
this game is awufal . it has loads of bugs , and gets slow towards the end of it . There are very few units also . I have had it for 3 days , and i am already board . Also the AI is really bad . I need to play on the hardest setting , and it is still easy . If you want a better game for less price , then buy Starcraft .	-1
Oh ! come on this game isnt that easy . It is so hard . This game has too many confusing puzzels . If you looking for something Really fun try something a little easier .	-1
I really never understood the craze of this game . If you can get past ryu 's ki blasts thdn he uppercuts you and starts shooting at you again . If you manage to make it to bison he stands on your head over and over until you die . Same with chun li . If you can get past sagats flying discs then he uppercuts you . If you try to attack guile he does his knee saber thing . Balrog gets you in a corner and stuns you with each hit and blocking still lowers your health , but attacking makes you get hit and die . The game at medium difficulty abuses the meta knowledge it has where if you punch and it punches , the favor is in the games timing and details so much that you are the one that gets hit . Plainly , the game is not fun due to a a computer tgat absurdly measures everything to its advantage to where every time you attack the game has measured and counter attacks flawlessly like a kid playing a master at chess . I hold my own in fighting games and am well versed in them , but the meta knowledge kills this game for me . # star because i honestly dont enjoy this game anymore . As a kid with nosalgia maybe , buy now as an adult , no .	-1
This and every other Street Fighter game ever made is overrated garbage.I ca n't believe how much people used to like this game.I 've always hated Street Fighter.I think it was because I have always been a diehard Mortal Kombat fan , and since Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter have always been , and always will be rivals , I have , and will always , side with Mortal Kombat.MK had everything that this game did not.SF had dull cartoon-looking characters , while MK 's characters were digitized and looked very realistic.SF was also more for kids , while MK blew everybody away with it 's over-the-top violence and buckets of blood n gore.The gameplay was also so much better in MK as well , compared to SF II.Overall , If you want a REAL fighting game for your Genesis , get the Mortal Kombat games , and do n't bother wasting your time and money on this or any other Street Fighter game for that matter .	-1
I know what you'e thinkin ' ! ! I love Street Fighter 2 , especially the Champion Edition because it super cool , fun , and has the outstanding graphics for its time , great selectable characters , and fluent controls . Thats good and all for Super NES releases , but what was Sega thinking when releasing this game on the Genesis ? Read carefully because there are two major things I find wrong with the release on this console.1 . The buttons are limited . I know that the Genesis has three main buttons other than start , but a standard fighting game has six buttons ( HK , MK , LK , HP , MP , LP ) , not three ! ! I do n't know if this game is programmed for Genesis ' new six button controller , but in order to use punch and kick buttons , you have to switch it up by pressing start , but that sucks the fun out of the game when you are trying to use a combination of moves to make it possible to defeat your opponent.2 . THERE 'S NO PAUSE BUTTON ! ! ! In order to make a button to switch up from punches to kicks and vice versa , they made it for the start button ! ! Theres absolutely no excuse for a 16-bit game to not have a pause button ! If you dare to play this game on the Genesis , make sure you have no interruptions : go to the bathroom before playing , make sure your parents do n't need anything for two hours , and leave a message on your answering machine that says `` I 'm playing Street Fighter 2 on the Genesis that has no pause button , leave a message after the beep . BEEP ! `` What a rip off ! If you want to play the same classic game with the same graphics , but with more working control buttons and a pause button , get it for Super NES .	-1
This game , while a decent port from the PS version as far as a port goes , is very frustrating . First it 's difficult to learn and play , and the graphics sometimes makes gameplay even more difficult . ( BTW , it 's not really scary . ) The most annoying thing for PC gamers is you ca n't save the game at any point . Instead there are only a limited number of occasions where you can save your progress . The novelty factor is no longer than as there was with the original RE ( which was not as novel as the truly original Alone in the Dark ) .	-1
This game is horrible . At the release of the movie I thought it would be fun to play the game series , then go see the flick . I heard friends rave about this game , so I purchased it and could n't get myself through the first ten minutes . The camera angle is annoying , the controls clumsy , the gameplay corny . The graphics left this veteran gamer with a sour taste . However , if you like zombies and do n't mind its serious flaws , give this one a try . Maybe you 'll feel better about it than I did .	-1
The game idea was good , but the running and loading lock up the computer or slows it to a crawl .	-1
There should be a very easy setting . The game is much too difficult for me which makes it unplayable .	-1
Max Payne has been in development for approximately 4 years , and it took all that time to publish a [ ... ] game that does n't include a multiplayer mode , very , very few cut scenes , and one boring character who has the constant look of constipation or a reaction to `` stinky feet '' on his face 100 % of the time , it 's really very annoying.The whole game revolves around `` Bullet time , '' a nifty idea that is great when it 's simply another feature in a game , but to have the entire game built around it is simply boring.Max Payne consists of running into a dark room , shooting everybody , then moving on to the next room , wash , rinse and repeat , over and over and over.On top of that you get to read incredibly corny , `` John Woo '' style ( whatever that is ) dialogue ( read : bad cliches ) and cinematic flair.The story revolves around you finding your wife and child shot by someone and you go out for revenge as a renegade cop of sorts and uncover a large conspiracy . The characters are completely uninteresting , look much too similar , and the comic book style text which breaks things up are as boring and dull as an episode of NYPD Blue.Max Payne should 've ( been cheaper ) for the game itself is only about 10 or so hours long , has little to-no extras , and limited replayability.Shooting people in slow motion simply is n't enough to knock my socks off I guess .	-1
Okay , the game is n't horribly bad . It ran fine on my computer . No problems with instal or starting or anything like that . Default controls are weird but changeable . My major drawback to this game was what was the point ? The graphic novel would have been interesteting if it was something you get at the comic shop . I feel cheated by lack of movies . The novel could have been made into movies and lasted a little longer . It was short . The weapons were cool but the bullet-time , should just have stayed in the Matrix . The graphics were great but for a first-person shooter the game was not all that good . When its in the [ price ] bin , get it . But other than that save your money .	-1
I really did not think i would like this game . But , it is both challenging and fun . This is unlike any other game i have ever played . Worth buying most definetly .	-1
I just finished MP , and it only took me a day and a half . Judging from other comments on Amazon I 'm not the only person to have finished the game in such a short time . The graphics are a real mix . The cool particle engine shines as a stunning example of what we can look forward to in the next generation of game engines , but the scenery and background art looks brown and dull throughout the entire game - think Quake2 without the aliens and you 're not far off.The game 's one & quot ; gimmick & quot ; of a slo-motion play mode is fun for the first couple of hours , then just gets boring . I wish they had spent more time on producing a story ( it has every cheesy cliche in the book , and is presented by a dull expressionless monotone narration ) .The game was so gripping that I just had to go and fill in my yearly tax return instead . Do n't buy the hype.. buy a decent game instead .	-1
One main gimmick ( the bullet-time feature ) and some decent graphics . That 's all this overrated game really offers . And not only is it a 1.5 trick pony , but it 's a very short one , too ... you can finish it the same day you receive it.Suffice it to say Max Payne is just poor value all round . It 's obvious most of the reviewers here either do n't have the game or reviewed it while still in their 10-hour honeymoon with it . It 's incredible how much a couple of days can sober one 's opinion of this lackluster game . My two cents ? Save your money and do n't bother till it hits the bargain bin .	-1
This might be a great game , but I may never know . In spite of having a P3 with 640MB of RAM and a 64MB Graphics card , this game has crashed ( frozen ) my Windows ME system three times in a row , as I 've tried to & quot ; play & quot ; the tutorial . I 've been trying to download a patch all day , and the miserable connection speed eventually degrades to nothing , and then restarts ( thankfully where it left off ) . If it ever downloads and installs , perhaps it will resolve my freezes , but not so far .	-1
While this is a terrific game concept with some nice features , it is far more work than play . The core of the game is a standard 4X space empire builder , with colony management , a complex tech tree , tactical space and ground combat , espionage , and diplomacy . But there is no centralized display of colony status . A building must be supplied with both power and workers in order to operate , and if it does n't have enough of either , it will simply shut down and the game gives you no warning or announcements . You are forced to pause the game every few months and personally inspect every single colony to discover these problems . But the tech system is even worse , and has not been improved from IG1 . There are three types of tech , and so you have to have three types of labs . But you can only research one invention at a time , so while you 're developing a new hyperdrive in your ship labs , your ground unit and colony facility labs are sitting idle , sucking up your colony 's power and workers . If you ca n't afford that waste , and most of the time you ca n't , you have to once again personally remember where you placed each one of up to 30 labs , go to the colony display for each planet on which you have a lab , and turn the idle ones off , one at a time . If you decide to develop a new building next , you have to go around and turn off all the ship labs and turn all the building labs on again . And I do n't have room here to go into the game 's futile diplomacy system , or the sluggish screen redraw , or the constant nagging interruptions by messages regarding random events and spies demanding orders . No offense to the other reviewers here , but only a hardcore strategy addict with a fetish for micromanagement could enjoy this game . I returned it four days after I bought it .	-1
I heard terrific things about Giants : Citizen Kabuto and was sadly disappointed when I finally purchased and played it for myself . The most obvious annoyance was the lack of an in game save option . I just do n't have patience to play the same mission over and over . And over . If you believe patience is a virtue , you can develop it playing this game . As for me , I could n't even stand to finish it .	-1
The graphics are smooth and intense . The controls , even though initially confusing , are pretty good . I 've gotten pretty far in this game as well ( 8 out of 10 levels completed ) after playing many , many hours on this game.Sound good , right ? Wrong ! The difficulty of the Dreamcast version is terrible . I had been in the console/computer game business a while back , and one of the main flaws I noticed is that computer game developers are hardcore gamers , developing games for hardcore gamers . This is a classic example . ... Given enough time , many people could pass this game . However , there are limits . After all , it 's just a game , and should only take a maximum 100 hours to complete . This is well beyond the 100 hours.Unless you live and breathe video games and you find ninety-nine percent of all games too easy , stick to another game . I can not stress this enough ! It is nearly impossible to complete for any normal person !	-1
This game is the typical & quot ; grab headlines and not deliver & quot ; that I 'm coming to expect from Lucasarts . This is an RTS 2 years behind in Technology . I 've never understood how the Empire could n't have a battlefield mapped , yet the & quot ; ZERO FIELD OF VISION & quot ; persists in this game . The controls are twitchy , and the graphics are ca n't even compete with lower class RTS games like Metal Fatigue . I bought the game b/c I 'm a fan , but I 'd rather spend my time reading the novels than play this poorly done amateurish shrink wrapped goop .	-1
The Good : For the first time , command Star Wars Imperial and Rebellion units in real time . The sound is truly the most excellent part of the game ; the unit sounds are fantastic , and the metal-ized version of the Imperial Theme is a nice touch . Graphics are a bit dated , but I feel they 've done a good job with what they had , using a dated 3D engine.The Bad : The main menu and the user interface for controlling your force looks extremely tacked-on in a last-minute fashion , and should have been done much better . The interface makes controlling units a chore . This is a common deficiency in recent LucasArts games , though . The 3D perspective takes time to master , and until you do master it , you 'll lose alot . This combined with the interface reduces you to alot of micromanagement , which can get problematic.The worst aspect of the game is how resources are derived . The game works on a system of & quot ; command points & quot ; , whereby you are rewared with the capability to purchase more resources when you are succesful in combat . This sounds like it might have been innovative , but in this implementation what happens both in the single player and multiplayer game is that the player ( or computer ) who wins early skirmishes gets access to greater numbers of units and advancements , thus quickly overwhelming their opponent . This condition , where the outcome is decided from the start and you 've virtually no way to recover from an early falter , causes frustration and represents to me poor design.If you are an absolute freak about Star Wars , you might enjoy this game because you 'll be able to re-enact the battle of Hoth and other scenarios . If however you want an excellent real-time strategy game , try Starcraft or Age of Empires II . If you want strategy in 3D , Homeworld is also an excellent bet .	-1
This would have been a great game except for the actual user interface . What a mess ! Unless you are a 5th dimensional being with 20 eyes , you got lost while trying to manage the games meandering views . Locking onto troops in order to give them orders is a tortuous exercise.I gave up after two hours and uninstalled this programming mistake . This is another LA game that does'nt live up to it 's promise .	-1
I am a true Star Wars fan and I collect everything and love all the movies but this was definatley not an enjoyable game . Sadley the gameplay did not come natural , so there was a learning curve . The graphics were behind the times and character movement was horribloe . I even often found AT-ST getting stuck up against a wall and unmoveable - a total frustrating moment . Yes this is Star Wars and yes it is great on that respect . However compare it to any RTS that came out a few years prior to it and you would be still dissapointed . I 'm sure Lucasarts will try again soon , hopefully ...	-1
This version of Risk I thought was an overall bad idea because it just played of the original . furthermore , the original RISK 1 disk was more than good enough in every department . The company who released this video game was just trying to `` update '' the game in which did n't needed to be updated . bad job over all	-1
Although this game has different playability than Risk 1 and good graphics , it is the cheatenist game I 've ever played , it is nigh impossible to win these games , except only occasionally , and by then you are too worn out from trying to win to enjoy it.I would not bother with it , stick with Risk 1 , the original.I 'm an old risk player from way back , I used to play the board game with my brother in law many years ago , and I have the pc version of original Risk , and even though that game cheats as do all computer games , it 's not near half as bad as risk 2 .	-1
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ! ! ! ! ! This was a HUGE waste of money . The gameplay was horrible . The way you control pac man is with a sling shot . He gets mad when you do n't do something fast enough it 's mpossible do stuff with the sling shot . you have to move stuff for him with the sling shot . seriuosly ? how dumb . i ended up reterning it because it was so bad . Save you money and buy yourself the good old original pacman game .	-1
Wow . There is n't much to say about this game other than simply `` Wow '' . Sarcastically mind you.Let me take you back to video game arcades in the 1980 's . Namco developed a little game called `` Pac-Man '' that featured a 6/8 yellow circle that had an insatiable appetite for dots that may or may not have a specific flavor . Unfortunately there were four ghosts who were n't too happy about this Pac-Man eating all these dots so they would try their hardest to stop Pac-Man at all costs . However some of those dots , seemingly grown using some type of growth enhancer , endowed Pac-Man with an unusual power to totally eat the ghosts ! Every now and then , someone would throw some fruit or a random food onto the play field for Pac-Man to devour , providing him with the ability to expand his palette a little.This is the game that became a world-wide phenomenon . This is the game that created a character that is universally recognized as an icon representing all that is great about the hey-day of classic gaming ! This great sprite known as Pac-Man leads the pack in the annals of classic gaming , showing one and all where our Xbox 360 and PS3 came from.Knowing that , Namco still had the audacity to lower Pac-Man to this sorry state ? To portray Pac-Man not as an iconic leader of the classic gaming era , but rather as some overly emotional twit at the mercy of your slingshot ? The entire object of the game is to eventually beat down some creature made entirely out of gum . That 's fine and all , but the game engine does n't support the appropriate controls for combat of this nature let alone the simple and obvious fact that the missions really do n't relate enough to put two and two together to get to a climatic battle with the gum monster . The missions just seem totally random in purpose ; and this does n't account for the fact that simply completing the main game missions only adds up to just under 50 % of the entire completion rating for the game . Seeing as how annoying this game is , I ca n't see any reason to try to complete 100 % of the game.The gameplay is somewhat autonomous in the sense that the game basically does whatever it wants until you sling a rock anywhere on the screen . Pac-Man moves in a direction continually until either something attacks him or you hit him with either a rock or a Super Pac-Ball or he just decides he does n't like you anymore . The engine is based on Pac-Man 's emotions . If you keep Pac-Man happy , he 'll do whatever it is you want him to do and this is usually the only way to ensure that you complete any of the game 's missions because if you make Pac-Man angry , he 'll ignore your commands and ignore objects in the environment that you 'll need to have to complete missions.The only real way to interact with Pac-Man to make sure he does what you want him to do is to shoot at stuff in the environment . You can make him eat foods like apples and hot dogs , you 'll have to shoot at things to get them to drop from trees or to keep things from hitting Pac-Man , you 'll need to shoot doors of stores ( surprisingly the glass on the doors does n't break ) to make Pac-Man go in , and what 's more , you 'll have to shoot Super Pac-Balls at him to make him turn into Super Pac-Man so that he 'll attack the ghosts when they appear.Speaking of that , another annoying aspect of the game is the ghost encounters . Essentially you 'll need to fight the ghosts off so that Pac-Man will stop sniveling like a little wimp . You ca n't shoot at them with your normal rocks , you 'll have to shoot a Super Pac-Ball at Pac-Man to turn him into Super Pac-Man . Once this happens , again , you have absolutely no control over Pac-Man . The game just makes him fly back and forth across the current screen until the time runs out and he attacks anything that resembles a ghost . This lack of control just becomes down-right annoying . It 's basically a `` Day in the Life of Pac-Man Simulator '' .Sometimes I get bored with trying to figure out what I 'm supposed to do and just shoot at Pac-Man until he gets really mad and gets attacked by a cat near the hot dog stand . That 's more fun then actually trying to finish the game , which if you did you wasted your time like I did.Then there are these stages where you have to guide Pac-Man while he 's flying a hang glider or riding in a mine cart . Now these are n't that bad because there are n't too many of them but there 's one mine cart ride in particular that really just blew me away with its difficulty . The game goes from being totally cryptic to virtually unbeatable in under twenty seconds and the worst part is you have no choice but to continue through the mine shaft . It took me , quite literally , two hours to get though this shaft and the reward at the end was n't even hardly the beginning of anything satisfying because it lead to the backyard of Pac-Man 's house.I really do n't know what Namco was thinking with this game and honestly I do n't want to know . While they did present some very original ideas to gameplay , what they got was something far from satisfying , not to mention they defamed Pac-Man 's reputation . This game is no where even close to a start of becoming anything like the game that made Pac-Man famous . The game is definitely not worth the buy and should be avoided at all costs unless you 're missing a piece in your SNES collection .	-1
This is my least favorite game in the franchise . ( Pinball does not count . ) The lack of a map and annoying Chozo Ruins music severely limit the enjoyment . HOWEVER , I do reccommend playing the 1st area of this game and then playing the AM2R demo . You will not believe the difference . I ca n't wait for AM2R . GOD BLESS MILTON GUASTI ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
Take everything wrong with Mega Man 1 and 2 on the NES and you get this . Your fired shots travel WAY TOO SLOW on the Game Boy , and these stages , especially the Fortress and Space Station at the end of the game , are NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE ! Plus if you lose in either you have to start over , and that means if you die at the end of the Fortress , at the hands of a Robot Leader , you have to fight the whole way back to them , and any you beat must be beaten again.ROBOT LEADERS WAVE ONE : Elec Man , Cut Man , Fire Man , Ice ManFORTRESS ROBOT LEADERS : Bubble Man , Flash Man , Heat Man , Quick Man , and ? This ai n't no masterpiece and is for Mega Man die-hards only .	-1
Early levels are easy but watch out when you do the hard ones - the AI is BRUTALIf you want to play the original that started it all , this might be for you , but if you just wanted one of the Mario Kart series , look for the DS version or the one on Wii .	-1
I keep trying to force myself to play this thing because all I read are rave reviews for it ... but I 'm not feeling it . First off half of the sound effects are downright ANNOYING ( that crying baby Mario makes me reach for the power button every time ... could n't they have thought of something else ? ? ? ) . Then there are the controls , which I find much less intuitive than other Mario games -- even the way Yoshi jumps is off ... it 's way too slow . Even if I look past those issues , I still do n't find myself having fun while playing this game . Where 's the fun ? ?	-1
I have never heard of this game but am a big mario fan so i bougt it . unfortunately it did not work but the seller was glad to refund me the full price and i didnt have to return the game .	-1
This is one of the worst RPG 's ever in existance . Besides being easy , it also has an unoriginal plot and crap graphics . I think the Atari 2600 's system is more advanced than this game . I mean , what 's an RPG without scantly clad women ? This RPG has none , except for a princess who is as clothed as a fememist is . And Mallow and Geno are loaded with fail , and I do n't see why people want them in Smash Brothers , which is a crap game as well . The plot tries to be all original by not centering on Bowser kidnapping and raping Peach , who is called Toadstool for whatever reason , but on some character named Smithy who is trying to take over the world by getting stars . Whatever . And the battle system is awful as well . I mean , timed hits ? For a good Mario game , play Mario is Missing ! , Mario 's Time Machine , or the CDI classic , Hotel Mario . If you want a good RPG , for the SNES , play Dungeon Master of Final Fantasy Mystic Quest .	-1
Best game ever , but I wanted to long to test it and could n't return it . My game did n't work .	-1
Like i said i do not like RPGs and especially this one . I have it because of course its mario and im willing to try any mario . It takes so long to beat it because the RPG and it gets on ur nerves when u cant beat a boss or enemy and u have to restart and beat them . At the begining it has some cheesey video of what happend to peach . It took me forever to beat it and as soon as i did i felt much better and it did not seem as much as a dumb game . The graphics r ur ordinary snes graphics and the sound is not as good as most snes games . I dont like it because its an RPG but the only reason i keep it is because it adds to the collection and my little cousin loves to play it .	-1
I am just as aware as anyone that people do not base their opinions of popular videogames on intelligent scripting , intelligent plot , intelligent substance , and intelligent thinking , so no one has to remind me . If they did , this `` Colony Wars '' never would 've left a single draft.First of all , I too respect the abilities of developers of Psygnosis as much as anybody , and I would like to describe that respect , but I feel I have to say my piece about this game and come to my point.There is n't a single idea in this game that is n't founded on generic thinking , the thievery of other games , and on movie cliche 's . There is n't one single idea based in science fiction , unlike its other competitor , `` Darklight Conflict , '' the true hero here , a little-known and original game released by Electronic Arts ( EA ) before `` Colony Wars '' was conceived . `` Darklight Conflict '' was a space-shooter , and the gameplay idea for `` Colony Wars '' merely replicated that game.Here 's the story of `` Colony Wars '' : `` You are a militant fighter pilot in space on the side of the rebel alliance who is trying to force the evil Emporer to his senses by shooting up his armies , '' or so says the narrational voice of an actor that sounds exactly just like James Earl Jones ( the voice of Darth Vader ) during the full-motion videos ( FMVs ) which were made by the same company who did special effects for `` Independence Day . '' Sounds like a direct , word-for-word copy of the plot of `` Star Wars . `` Here 're the ideas of `` Colony Wars '' : Large firey explosions even if they do n't really exist in space because fire needs oxygen to exist and space has no atmosphere . Black holes even if they do n't exist as large red whirlpools in the middle of space backgrounds because their gravity is so intense , light can not escape . Spaceships even though they do n't have wings like planes because there is no atmospheric friction to enable control using aero parts . Also , they do n't make loud rumbling noises when they pass by the camera lense because sound needs atmosphere . Here , you get a future of imperialistic humans warring over the colonization and liquidation of the rest of the planetary systems in the universe for purposes of natural resources . The mission and battle drill instruction voice is male , but it is okay for a female to narrate if limited to talking about other subjects like the options menus . `` Space cowboys '' does not make science fiction , only unoriginal action games captivating non-thinkers.Here 's the story of EA 's `` Darklight Conflict '' : You are a Top Gun pilot in the middle of a dogfight when suddenly a beam of light surrounds you . When you awake , you are in a completely foreign environment . You realize your arms and legs have been replaced with some kind of tentacles that are biologically grafted to what appears as the console of a space vehicle . A voice speaks in English to you , but it is not the voice of any human . You have been inducted into the army of an alien race in the midst of interplanetary war to help defend their losing side , which is why they recruited you with your expert fighter pilot experience . Their vessels are signified by a symbol , a four-fingered hand . At first , you will begin with training . The small fighterships are oval , with fins protruding from what could be their sides . The weaponry is a variety involving weird plasma cannons . Your ship uses an electromagnetic field to shield itself , but it consumes a great deal of energy . You venture through the wormhole warps , and should carefully avoid the radiation waves that usurp your vessel energy during the travel.Even the name `` Darklight Conflict '' is science fiction . I could connect some of the premise of the game with the old sci-fi film `` This Island Earth '' , but not much of its premise . In that movie , a group of scientists are helping an alien race that appear about human , so the scientists do n't find out they 're aliens immediately . When they do , the aliens take them to their planet and the alien commander tells them their planet is being overrun by another planet 's race , and they recruited Earth 's best scientists to come up with new and advanced technology to help them survive the invasion . Their enemies soon destroy the planet , but the ship has enough energy to return the scientists to Earth . After their safe return , the aliens drive their ship into the sea , never to be heard from again.But , who remembers stuff like that ?	-1
I do n't get the appeal of the Wipeout games . They 're terrible . Wipeout 3 and XL are no different . The music is good enough ( for a bunch of techno beats ... yeah , I 'm not a techno fan ) and the graphics are slick and futuristic-looking , but the actual racing part has one BIG problem : you keep hitting the side of the track as you go around a turn and for some reason that means you have to make a complete stop . It would n't be so bad if you just slowed down , but the fact that your vehicle stops *immediately* is the worst thing ever.How are you supposed to enjoy a racing game if you keep hitting the side of the track and STOPPING every couple seconds ? There 's so many turns in any one of the races , that the problem is unavoidable . I do n't understand when people say you need skill to enjoy these racing games . If I ca n't increase speed , then what ELSE is there to enjoy ? If the appeal lies in playing each race over and over so you can memorize the track to avoid hitting the side , then count me out . Doing that would be WAY too tedious of a task . You need a lot of space to freely drive around or else a racing game wo n't work.Sure , I can go around shooting other vehicles , but who cares about that when I ca n't ever catch up to them . Too many sharp turns in the Wipeout series make it difficult to build up speed . Right when I think I 've got a good race going , I hit the side and my car stops and there goes the momentum . What a way to kill the fun.Buy if you want a slap of crap .	-1
I purchased a brand new factory sealed Sega Genesis 3 over 8-months ago . It is very light weight and compact compared to the earlier versions . However , in decreasing size and weight Sega has also diminished the quality.I was very excited when I first recieved the Sega Genesis 3 console . Unfortunely this excitement quickly faded . After plugging in the controllers to the connection port over 3-dozen times , the ports began to pull away from the exterior casing and pushing inward where you could not even plug in the controller anymore.On top of this the controller ports are fastened to the power switch circuit board which also pulled back with the ports , causing the power switch to become inoperative . After removing the casing and leaving it off permanetly , I was then able to plug the controllers into the exposed ports and use the system correctly.Obviously this is not the way you want to use or care for your BRAND NEW system . Now that circuit boards are exposed they are susceptible to far more complications with dust and possible component detachment.Could this issue have been a once-in-a-million fluke ? Sure , but after spending over $ 75.00 for the brand new Sega Genesis 3 , I will not take a chance at purchasing another , due to the fact that it does feel rather fragile and flimsy . I would recommend the Sega Gensis 2 over this model or even take my chances with the newOfficially Licensed Sega Genesis Gen Core System w/ 20 Sega Games Built-in & Cartridge Slot .	-1
No matter how good you are at this game , nothing can prepare you for the lame cheap fest your in for . I beat this game countless times but it never stops pissing me off that the enemies are so cheap , the game is so unfair and how they use the screen layout to their advantage . Half the time no matter what you do you ca n't move because your getting gang raped and your sword magically goes through enemies running past you preparing for the gang rape , then your screwed . I love games that are challenging , but not insanely hard just because of crippled controls and cheapness . Fun for a little while , but the cheapness is too much .	-1
Remember the moment in the movie Jurassic park when Dr. Grant raced across the plains of the jungle on the back of a galimums while shooting his machine gun at attacking helicopters ? How about when he trecked through ancient aztec ruins while shooting flame thrower equiped janitors ? And do n't forget the time he ran around on a cargo ship while blowing up floors and engines with his arsenal of grenades.What ? You do n't recall those action packed moments ? Neither do I , but that 's what 's presented in the sega genesis game `` Jurassic park : Rampage edition . `` Jurassic park rampage edition ( JPRE ) takes an alternate , more action paced look at the classic story of dinosaurs gone amok on a jungle island . Where in the books and the movies Grant was a quiet paleontologist who just wanted to dig up ancient bones in the desert , here he 's become a super military commando who makes Rambo look like Ronald McDonald . Where in the movie and books Grant was focused on getting off the island without becoming dinosaur food , here he 's shooting everyone and everything in sight ... which is n't necessarily a bad thing , due to the fact that everyone and everything on the island is out to kill him.It should be said up front right now . JPRE is the most unintentionally silliest games i 've ever played . All the little factors add up to create an experience that is so silly and so dorky in all it 's aspects that one ca n't help but chuckle when you look back on the experience.Where to begin ? Well , let 's start with the other humans . For some reason , Jurassic park is populated with thousands of soliders and janitors , both who are equipped with military weapons and are , for some reason , out to kill you . No matter where you go , you 'll find dozens of soldiers and janitors shooting at you and chucking grenades in your direction ( Luckily , Grant can survive multiple grenade hits , so it 's not too much of a problem ) . It 's a mystery why these guys are out to kill you when there 's no logical reason to it . Furthermore , they seemed to have made an alliance with the local dinosaurs because they never attack them , and the dinosaurs never attack them as well . It seems that poor Grant is under the crosshairs of every single living thing on the island.Every stage you go through in the game ( with the exception of Grant 's final level ) is packed to the brim with a riddiculous number of soldiers , janitors , raptors , compys , spitters , and even a triceratops or two . How do you deal with these threats ? Here 's a hint . You run . You run your stubbly little legs as fast as you can . While the whole point of JPRE is to be an action packed game where you shoot every living thing in sight , it 's simply much more efficent to just run and jump your way to the exit ( with this method , you can finish the game in about twenty minutes ) .If you want , you can go through the game and try to kill everything with your enormous arsenal of weapons ( more on those later ) , it 's simply not really worth the effort . For one thing , you 'll probably get hit a lot trying to inflict damage on your enemies . Trying to kill raptors is a pain in the butt due to faulty hit detection . A raptor ( or two ) will jump next to you and start bitting and whacking away with thier tails as you frantically fire your shotgun over and over again trying to hit them , yet they take no damage . So you leap away and start firing , and finally kill them after several shots . As a result of not being able to hit them at point blank range , you 've lost 3/4th of your health and a lot of ammo has been wasted . When attacking kamikazie soldiers and janitors , it 's very common to have several grenades chucked in your direction before you even get a shot off . Result ? Loose health before you even take out one guy.And let 's not even talk about the wackiest enemy in the game . Attack helicopters ! Yes , that 's right . When going through the savanna level , Grant is constantly being assaulted by attack helicopters that fire rockets at him ! When I saw one coming onto the scren for the first time , I had to pause the game because I was laughing too much to keep going . Here I was , just trying to get across that blasted savanna , being attacked by grenade chucking soldiers and machine gun equipped janitors , and here i 'm being attacked by an attack helicopter ? ! What kind of psycho island is this ? ! Thankfully , these helicopters can be driven away by shooting ... of all things ... tranquilizer darts into them . Whee ! Fortunitly , to counter the threat of attack helicopters and flame-thrower equipped janitors , you have an enormous arsenal of military grade weapons at your disposal . No longer satisfied with gas grenades and puny tranquilizer pistols ( from the original Jurassic park game on the Sega genesis ) , Grant has an arsenal of death dealing weaponry , ranging from shotguns to machine guns , to rockets and death dealing grenades . All of these get the job done , but the greatest satisfaction comes from using the greatest weapon in the history of video games : The electric gun ( or as I call it , the zappy gun ) . This amazingly fun weapon does n't just kill bad guys , it disintigrates them ! Simply fire the gun , watch the bolt of electricity go out , and when it hits the janitor , he 'll go `` Ogh ! `` , briefly turn into a skeleton , and vanish into thin air . It sounds brutal , but it 's absoloutly hilarious to watch ! ( and let 's face it , disintigrating an incredibly annoying enemey is tremendously satisfying ! ) . As an added bonus , it also does the disentigration effect on dinosaurs as well ! If one wants to have lots of gunning and running action while shooting dinosaurs , then you 'll certianlly get it while playing this game . Going through each level pits you against literally hundreds of soliders and dinosaurs , so much so that at times it 's easy to get overwhelmed . Fortunitly , the game does include a desperatly needed checkpoint system ( which was missing in the first genesis game ) . This is the kind of game that you can play two ways . You can run and try to survive to get to the end , or you can take your time and kill everything you come across , so you do get a bit of freedom when it comes to how you play.But even with all the guns , the sillyness of the game , and even the checkpoints ... JPRE just is n't much fun to play . As I said earlier , it 's fairly easy to be overwhelmed by enemies in some levels , but the game eventually just boils down to `` run and shoot '' or just `` run '' . There are items you collect for points , but those points do n't do anything.At it 's core , JPRE is a simple , run around and shoot em up shooter . It has good graphics , some nice music ( I do like the jazz/rock theme ) , but whether you like it or not is really up to personal taste . If you like mindless action games with guns ... lots of guns ... then you might like this . With many emulators on the internet , why not try downloading it and giving it a try ? You just might find yourself getting a laugh or two messing around with those crazy janitors .	-1
Back in 1993 Sega released a dull , lackluster video game of one of the biggest films of all time . Quickly realizing their mistake they hashed out a different version of the game , claiming it would be bigger , tougher and better.It is n't . It 's a slow , boring game.You can choose to be either Dr. Alan Grant or ... a Raptor . Both have their problems . Why would Dr. Grant go around killing all those army guys ( just what are they doing in the game ) ? And why a Raptor be killing other Raptors ? Weird.Obviously not learning from their first mistake Sega really dropped the ball on this so-called Rampage Edition . One of the slowest , sluggish and dullest platformers I have ever played .	-1
What happens when you take away Sonic 's speed ? You get Sonic Labyrinth ! This game is more of a puzzle-platformer than an Fast-Paced Platformer . Which is why this game gets a 2 STAR RATING !	-1
It 's honestly hard to believe this game was released in 1995 . It 's the same year that brought us Vectorman , Rayman , Windows 95 and its games , and lots more stuff ( Movies like Toy Story ! ) . But why Sonic has to step into the ring with Sonic Labyrinth on the Game Gear is beyond me . Yes , folks . Even Classic Sonic had skeletons in his closet , and this is one of them.So apparently , Sonic happens to be wearing super-slow shoes built by none other than Dr. Robotnik . But the question is : Why ? Why does Sega have to offer us a game that could have been the Game Gear equivalent for Sonic 3D Blast , and remove Sonic 's trademark speed ? And to have to utilize a stupid storyline to go with it ( Robotnik waits outside Sonic 's HOUSE while he 's sleeping , and gives a speech about his `` evil '' plan ) ? This would 've been MUCH more fun if Sonic was Sonic . Granted , he still has the Spin Dash , but you 'll have to be using that every single time if you want to go somewhere . It gets annoying really.On top of all that , the music ( for once ) is terrible and forgettable , and while the graphics are decent , they wo n't be able to make up for the utter mess Sonic Labyrinth has to offer . Stick with any other Sonic game . Sonic Labyrinth is not worth the money .	-1
I do n't know what came upon Sega when they made this so-called `` game '' ( I normally refer to it as digital vomit ) . When you hear Sonic , you normally think `` Oh yeah , that faster-then-sound hedgehog who founded gaming with super-fast paced action ! '' . Sonic Labyrinth is not any of that . Instead of the `` super-fast paced action '' you get a slow and tedious maze to explore on a time limit ( and not the 10 minutes you get in the normal games ) . When I say slow I do n't mean long or boring , I mean Sonic moves slower then Mario , and that is saying something . It was n't an accidental bug or hardware issues either . It was meant to be . If you do n't mind watching your favorite hedgehog crawl around the areas , you will probably mind the other diasters . Music ? Makes Atari 2600 numbers sound good . Graphics ? Makes Pong look incredible . Gameplay ? I would rather play Mario 's Time Machine for a week then this for 60 seconds.Do n't buy this , you 'll never see Sonic the same way again . In fact , close this page and do n't look into Labyrinth any farther .	-1
The gameplay of this game is pretty good . Original , combining the commands and jobs and weapons of Final Fantasy with the turn-based grid-pattern gameplay of Dungeons and Dragons . It was way too slow , though , and in an age where a gamer will rap out half an hour of play and then save before heading to school/ college/job , hour-long tactical battles just suck . Especially when you lose most time and have to do them over and over again . But overall , it 'd be a good game.If I could stand to look at it.In this modern era of bump-mapping and CG animations that look real , as in REAL , a game where 'my green dot is beating the heck out of your purple square ' just does n't do the trick for me . Especially when their purple square always strangles the living snot out of my green dot . No way . I 'd be willing to bet that the graphics on the GBA are gon na look better than for the PS.So , I played it for three hours and then gave up . I had an entire row of PS2 generation RPSs to suck up my attention , such as FFX and its sequel . Which might not have the same old grueling fight system , but I can actually tell that Yuna is a girl , not a green dot with brown lines on her head .	-1
To get the bad out of the way , this game is slow , tedious , and & quot ; tactics & quot ; simply is not a good way to describe it . There is very little tactical combat involved . Moves happen immediately as soon as you choose an action . There are no attacks that change the position of enemies , so a very large amount of the game is luck regarding the position of your enemies to allow you to cast wide-range spells that will annihilate everything . Adding to the bad is the downright broken leveling system . Essentially it works like this : Perform an action , get experience and job points . Regardless of what action you perform . This ends up making you enter a random battle , killing all except one enemy , and throwing rocks at each other for an hour until you all have leveled up obscenely , and can essentially learn any skill now . Not very fun . The story is also pretty pathetic , the translation makes the game very difficult to understand , and the story itself does n't stand out among other RPGs . Personally , I do n't care for the whole medieval politics setup , but it might please some . The good ? There are a whole lot of skills and classes to learn and be , and the idea of being able to equip TWO job skills at once makes for some pre-battle strategy . For instance , you can choose to have a hybrid black and white mage , or a knight and a monk , or a summoner and a gunman . It 's a nice little touch . The soundtrack is also pretty decent orchestral stuff that can be catchy at times . Nonetheless , the whole experience gets very old after a while . The battles are not very diverse , you just unload your skills on everyone time and time again , the graphics are annoying and the camera can be frustrating , and overall , it just is n't very fun . Get Disgaea : Hour of Darkness for the PS2 instead , which does EVERYTHING much better , is deeper and more stylish , and much more strategy-oriented .	-1
I sometimes wonder how people would react to this game if it did not have the Final Fantasy franchise name attached to it.I can recommend two better tactical srpg games before you make this purchase : Vandal Hearts for psx and Shining Force 2 for the Genesis or Wii Virtual Console ( I would go the latter since genesis and snes games have issues with the save battery due to age ) or if endless grinding is your thing then Disgea series is another good recommendation.Not that this game is bad but I wanted the one star rating to get everyone 's attention and let them know they have better options when its comes to srpgs .	-1
I never did get to far playing this game . I just do n't get the hang of it . So I quit this game soon after I started . I like a game I can get somewhere with . I guess I did n't understand what it was all about when I bought it . Somebody else might do alright with it , but not me .	-1
After the disappointment of FF XII , was curious what makes that producer so well known and could mess up a frachise like this . So went back to the roots and try Final Fantasy Tactics . I think there are really some people who enjoy frustrations in games and think that this is the only way to consider a game fun . Final Fantasy Tactics is annoying , frustrating and unrewarding . I do n't know what 's wrong with people who think that this is a great game . You think you can spend time to level up the characters to make the story battles easier ? You are completely wrong . I 'm stuck in a boss battle that after a 100 hours of level up you thought you have characters 30 levels higher than the enemies , you should be ok ? You are wrong . The boss is so strong that despite you are 30 levels higher than them , it can wipe out your whole party in one go - despite all of them are 30 levels higher and have the best equipment on them at that point of the game . What 's the point ? I think I 'll give up the Final Fantasy frachise for good now if the next game is by the same producer . It 's not worth it at all . For people who think this kind of game challenging and fun , I think I 'd rather not be a gamer anymore . If I can , I want to give -5 stars to this game .	-1
who is giving this good reviews ? This has to be the worst RPG on PS1 . Interestingly , Sony initially believed that JRPGs wouldnt sell well in the west , and they released japanese games only if they were action/ arcade games . This was the first JRPG released , and it was something of a surprise `` hit '' . Its strong sales showed that there was a ready western market for JRPGs and led to the later high profile releases of classic rpgs such as final fantasy 7 and breath of fire 4.Like many PS1 owners at that time , I eagerly anticipated this game , hoping for an epic experience similar to final fantasy 6 on the SNES , but with incredible PSX graphics lol . Instead I got this horrible rubbish . Its completely generic with no personality whatsoever and includes every RPG cliche there is . Its extremely easy , with extremely simple mechanics , and also very long and tedious with endless dull battles .	-1
Lots and LOTS of random battles , dumb characters , dumb gameplay , graphics that would look bad on the SNES ( except for the constant battles ) . I played this when there were no other RPGs on the Playstation and I had the flu . With so many great RPGs out now , there is no reason for this game . Actually , there was no reason for it in the first place . I 'm an RPG nut , but this one is just plain bad .	-1
I was given this game by a friend who did n't want it anymore . Now I see why he was so quick to just give it away . This game is the worst of all RPG 's . Weak story , repetitive gameplay , bad music , and graphics that make me wonder whether this is a Playstation game or a GameBoy Color game . Stay away from this at all costs . You 'll see it selling for about $ 2.99 at some ebgames stores . The price is that low for a reason .	-1
A JUMPS AND B ATTACKS ? THAT MIGHT WORK ON THE NES , BUT NOT ON THE SNES . ON THE SNES IN MOST PLATFORMERS , B JUMPS AND Y ATTACKS . FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS STANDARD PRETTY MUCH DESTROYED THIS GAME . THERE 'S NOT EVEN A CONFIGURATION MODE TO FIX THE CONTROL PROBLEM . ALSO , GRAPHICS ARE UNIMPROVED OVER THE NES ! WHY ! ? The game 's not all bad though . Passwords allow you to continue from the level you left off on , which is a major convenience . Because of that alone getting this is better than getting the NES titles separately .	-1
This is a Mortal Kombat clone , with huge amounts of blood , and two fatalities for each competitor . The only difference with this game is that all of the fighters are pre-historic ! Two apes , a big dinosaur , a fire breathing legendary dinosaur , a raptor and much more . The gameplay is much like Street Fighter 2 , and the gameplay is very slow , because you are fighting as dinosaurs ! Another interesting feature is that for those who like to use the same move over and over again , the game laughs at you . Pretty cheap game , rent it before you buy it .	-1
( ... ) Primal rage is a game about seven dino-gods who are set free from their prisons when a disaster strikes & quot ; Urth & quot ; in the near future . The player 's goal is to defeat the other dino-gods , conquer their lands , gain the most number of worshippers and end up ruling the new urth . The concept sounds okay , but the game which follows the story is not really.When you turn on the game and arrive at the title screen , you may think the background bird sounds are cool . But go to the player select screen and from there it 's all downhill . The sound and music quality is more like that of a Sega Genesis game . Then there are weird scratching noises at times , and a horrible & quot ; continue screen & quot ; music that will make you drop the controller and run for an asprin ! The graphics are slightly easier to handle . The seven monsters are reasonable , especially the t-rex duo Sauron and Diablo . Sometimes however you may find yourself trying to identify which is the head and tail in the middle of the action . The backgroung visuals are also decent . But the fatalities ... are terrible . They are nowhere near the quality of Mortal Kombat . It 's hard to actually figure out what they are doing in some.Then there are the special moves . Some of them are okay ( like Diablo 's & quot ; hot foot & quot ; ) , and some of them are not ( like Chaos 's & quot ; farts & quot ; and & quot ; puke & quot ; ) . Talk about weirdness . The character Vertigo is ridiculous . A dinosaur with the head of a cobra and the tail of a scorpion ? Some special moves are hard to identify as what they 're supposed to be . The controls are n't quite what you 'd want . The characters are poor at jumping , and even slow and clumsy on ground . It 's sometimes hard to identify if the move they are performing is a special move or just a normal one . Oh , I said something of the sort above , did n't I ? So if you want a Genesis quality game for your SNES ( you 're nuts ) , then you can buy this . But what 's the point ? The SNES has much more eye-candy and easier to control fighting games out there . This is one of the least appealing SNES fighting games I 've played . If you want some mindless button-mashing with no real depth and unrealistic amounts of gore , this game is for you . Incase you do n't realise the difference in quality right away , play this first and then play Street Fighter II Turbo , Mortal Kombat or even TMNT : Tournament Fighters . You soon will .	-1
I guess the people who like this game are kids , because this game was seriously not fun and was a boring stale platformer . There is really no fun to be pulled out of this mess and is basically devoid of clear objectives , interesting challenges , good gameplay , or a noticeable storyline . The graphics and character designs look great along with the environments along with some enemy designs . Unfortunately , all I found myself doing was collecting health , killing wierd and stupid enemies , and wondering what the hell I was supposed to be doing in this stupid game because apparently the developer did not make your objectives clear by some decision or another . So you 'll find yourself wandering a lot and trying to do a task all over again . This game is simply a chore and a nightmare to play . If you want to buy a good licensed game on a Disney movie , go buy the far better Aladdin game for SNES or Genesis .	-1
It was with great mourning that I retired my Gravis Xterminator , and now I feel like crying a river and pursuing some means of electronic resurrection or wizardry to bring it back ... I was looking for a controller ( whether gamepad or joystick ) that took advantage of USB technology and provided proportional control for driving/racing sims as well as flight sims like X-Wing Alliance and the new Crimson Skies . I looked around and decided on the Dual Strike , seeing that it had some decent reviews and , if I took the time to get past the 1.5 hour learning curve for its radical design , I 'd have an awesome controller on my hands that would let me do darn near anything.Frankly , I was disappointed every step of the way . Unlike my old Gravis , the Dual Strike 's & quot ; schemes & quot ; ( where you control the function of the programmable buttons ) have to be loaded seperately under the Game Controller every time you decide to play a different game -- the Gravis automatically adapted , recognizing the programs loading up.When I began to use the buttons , I realized how poorly they were actually placed . All to often , trying to press one button , I 'd wind up pressing another at the same time . The & lt ; A & gt ; button ( top button on right side of controller ) is almost completely inaccessable , and futzing around with the shift-key during the middle of a firefight is downright dangerous . The triggers where your index fingers rest are a nice attempt to provide what other controllers easily offer , but fail in that they activate during rough moves when you least want them to , and you forget they 're there when you most need them because they just feel like a solid part of the Dual Strike 's shell.The proportional control ( the swivelling part on the right ) does take a while to get used to , and once you do , it 's a truly innovative idea when it comes to FPSs . Great idea , offering a lot of flexibility and control . Unfortunately , the & quot ; center & quot ; position is without any form of guidance in the form of internal resistance . You 've got to futz around until your character finally stops moving to know when you 've found it , nothing intuitive about it at all . This was especially problematic when I tried to use the controller for Need for Speed : High Stakes and X-Wing Alliance . Frankly , there 's too much going on in sim environs , and a greater requirement for an auto-centering proportional control , than that which the Dual Strike provides.There are better pads out there ... You 're paying a mid-range price for a high-tech gimmick on a pad with below-average performance . I 'm inclined to give the pad only 1-star , because I was really looking for something to help me out on the sims , but to be fair it ranks about a 3 when it comes to FPSs , but they really have to figure out how gamers use the buttons to make this a decent FPS pad .	-1
The Dual Strike is an older controller and not supported by Microsoft anymore but I knew that when I bought it . Still , it was cheap and I was desperately searching for something other than my keyboard and mouse with which to play my computer games . The biggest problem I found with the Dual Strike is that it is n't supported by any of the more recent games currently out there and the configuration app that comes with it does n't work ( at least not on Win 7 ) . I did end up purchasing a nice little program called `` X-Padder '' which allows you to configure and/or rearrange any button on your keyboard and mouse to your keyboard or mouse or any other controller device you may have hooked up . X-padder made configuring the Dual Strike to any game I liked very easy ( It also helps configure my mouse and keyboard to games that do n't really support in depth key bindings ) . So , now I have the dual strike and a means to configure it to my games . My next issue was that I could n't get use to the funky way Dual strike works . I think its a controller people end up loving to death or hating . Perhaps if I practiced more with it Id like it better .	-1
Many magazines have been giving this item rave reviews , but I ca n't understand why . Sure the design is elegant and innovative , but it makes games almost impossible to play unless you are in absolute darkness . The glare from this light is just plain ridiculous , and the only way to decrease it is to bend the light to one side , which decreases the amount of light on the screen . There has GOT to be a better way to light up your gameboy , and let me tell you , this is NOT it .	-1
I bought my kids each one of these at Christmas , so that they could play with their Gameboys in the car when the light was low . Waste of time and money.The light is n't very powerful , does n't illuminate much of the screen , and seems to suck the batteries dry much sooner . The glare makes my eyes hurt , and I ca n't imagine it 's good for my kids either . We do n't use them any more . Do n't bother .	-1
Yes , it may look neat and attractive , but trust me , it is not worth it ! The glare from the light covers the entire screen ofmy GBC and makes game play impossible . And , if you try to cooperate with it , it just gives you a big headache . I guess playing in the dark is just not a good idea for now ,	-1
I applaud the creators for their effort , which we all know was immense . I 'm sure they put an insane amount of time and effort into this game , and they did manage to create some immersion . However , I did not care for the puzzles , and did n't feel inspired to go on . Video games work on a simple `` reward '' system . The level of difficulty should yield an equal reward . Otherwise , what 's the point ? Well I found with Myst that I was forced to accomplish and re-accomplish extremely large and time consuming tasks with little to no reward.In one `` age '' , if u choose a wrong switch you have to go somewhere else and re-charge a battery , and to re-charge the battery you have to pump water and this whole time you 're running back and fourth and back and fourth . I LOVE complex puzzles , but what I HATE is when they are spaced far apart and you have to keep running from A to B over and over , performing trial and error . I was n't really motivated by the story , if there was one , and the bit of acting in the game was silly . The ages were completely devoid of humanity , making the `` journey '' depressing . Oh did I mention `` secret hotspots '' ? Yeah if you ca n't figure out what to do next it 's because you have n't found the secret hotspot . Also the navigation is so confusing that you completely miss pathways . This is because when the curser says right or left , it sometimes actually means it 's going to turn you 180 degrees . That 's fine but when all the scenery looks similar , you do n't know you you just turned to the right , or 180 degrees . It 's a nightmare.One reviewer said their 10yr old son liked the game . Yeah right . He just thought it was fun to play on the computer . Trust me , he was n't actually playing the game . Most intelligent adults that i 've asked about this game felt that it nearly drove them mad and they got pretty angry at the game . Not because they were not smart enough , but because the game really tests your patience and most of all- does n't give you adequate rewards for your efforts . Sometimes when you step in an elevator the door automatically closes . Then , another time , you learn that you have to close the door yourself . I do n't feel like I 'm playing a game , I feel like I 'm just learning how the game creators try to stump us . I will not be playing Riven , or anything else by these people . Which is truly sad because the graphics in Riven look amazing . If they spent less time on complexity and size , and put more work in the story , and the drive , it could have been worth my while . I had more fun playing Aura , even with the nausea-inducing 3D nagivation . Syberia remains the champion .	-1
This game by any standards is violent . But that 's about all that I can say . Sure you can hit a guy in any of the 29 anatomical hit areas programmed into the game . Sure , it 's fun to watch a guy holding a stub of his foot after you blew it away with a shotgun . But how many of these images would you really like to see for the next 4 hours until you finally realize this is just what this game was all about . Nothing else . Graphics : Nice OpenGL . Might cause some problems with GeForce 256 cards . Interface : in game save . easy to use multiplayer options . Gameplay : regular shoot-em up . very formulaic : shoot , blood , run . Do this for 4 hours and you 'll finish the game . Weapons ballistics are not that real . Believe me ... I know . AI : can be intimidating sometimes . Look before you walk into any area . Story : weak , bad guy wants to blow up world . Overall : You 'll get tired of this game . If you want a good multiplayer experience though , get this game .	-1
Pokemon were cool , yes , there was a time when the great empire of little cuddly creature took America by storm . All 150 ( as the new one 's do n't matter a bit ) were great and were a lot of fun to see in the game . Then the franchise went down hill shelling out nothing that could be considered nothing more than drivel . I know this may be a lot for a person of any age who loves pokemon to swallow . But , the franchise is old and is nothing anymore but a waste of money . When , I first got this game I will not lie a bit , I was impressed it was a very fun game and I enjoyed owning it and being able to take pictures of various pokemon . When I finished the game though I was horribly disappointed . There were nowhere near the amount of Pokemon in the game I expected and the game really left little to the imagination ( can you believe that , a pokemon game , that leaves little to the imagination ? ) I wish I could rate this game higher and maybe if there were no alternative it may have rated higher , but there are better games out there and I 'm sorry but , I wasted my money on this game .	-1
I throughly did not like this game at all . Unless you enjoy being on a set track and taking pictures of pokemon with a limited amount of film and giving them food or bombing them or playing music for them and taking more pictures . Then this game is not for you .	-1
This game really sucks ! I rented it once for five days and I played it for one day and then I beat it ! It was so stupid . It is worse than mario party 3 ! If you are a first time game player , do n't get this game . If you have been playing Games for 50 years , do n't get this game . This is the worst game ever .	-1
This game was an extremely easy game that you can beat in 15 minutes . All you do is take pictures of dumb Pokemon . Then when you beat the game you have to try to beat the computers impossible scores . THAT 'S IT , DO NOT BUY	-1
If I could pick the most boring , esiest game in the world , I would pick this one . All you do is z+a=a picture . Throughout the levels you get things like bait and stuff , but unless your a serous camera fan , this game should be reccomended to no one .	-1
Do n't get this game . It is not worth the money . Ok.. you can print the picture out but then you have to buy the pokemon snap card and it costs about $ 5 and it is just not worth the money . And it is to short . No plot , no challange , might as well go through your photo album , it would be more entertaining	-1
I 'm rather baffled by all the positive reviews for this game . I bought it a couple months ago after reading all the good reviews and thinking this game must be a shining gem that has withstood the test of time . Well , now I 'm rethinking that assumption ... No doubt many people will disagree with me , but on with the review ! Graphics ( 6/10 ) : Sigh . Everything is pixelated . I 'm not sure whether the graphics for this game were considered good when the game was released or not . On the bright side , the character designs are good as well as the towns . The dungeons are another matter , but more on that later.Music ( 6/10 ) : I still ca n't figure out why people claim this game has a great soundtrack . I 've even heard people claim that Grandia 's music is some of their most favorite of all time . I wonder if Grandia is the only RPG they 've ever played ? Anyway , the majority of the tracks were n't too bad . Unfortuneately , I remember some pretty bad ones . There 's one jungle where the `` music '' seems to only be ambient jungle wildlife sounds , which got annoying after the 50th bird call . Unlike others , I found the Gumbo song to be one of the most annoying village themes ever . It 's okay right at first , but then starts to grate on your nerves the longer you stay in the village . One more thing-the voice acting deserves mention . It 's bad . I rank it as the worst voiceing I 've ever heard in a game . It sounds like they literally pulled people off the street and offered them $ 10 to read off some lines . Terrible.Characters ( 7/10 ) : The characters are interesting at first , until you realize that everyone 's the same . All possess the same plucky , happy-go-lucky adventurer personality . I have nothing against light-hearted games , but everyone really did seem to have the exact same personality ; there was just no balance to the party . Speaking of party , there was a high rate of people joining and then permanently leaving , this ( or something else ? ) really meant that no one really got any siginificant character development . Most everyone had no back story of interest ( or at all ) and were not well developed.Story ( 5/10 ) : Here 's where Grandia really starts to `` sag in the saddle '' , so to speak . The first 1/4 of the game and the last 1/4 are interesting and engaging . I really enjoyed the start in Parm ; rummaging through people 's houses , reading Justin 's diary for some amusing stories , and laughing at the way any alcoholic references were changed to `` coffee '' . Man , those were good times . Unfortunately , it all goes downhill from there . The middle of the game becomes a neverending series of filler events . The first couple `` villages in need '' or `` musty old ruins to explore '' did n't bother me at all , but after that , I started to feel like I was stuck on the wheel of karma or something . It just got really repetitive , until I just knew the next village I came to would have to be saved by me from some disaster . Well , what I refer to as the `` main '' story picked about the last quarter of the game , but it was n't nearly original or interesting enough to make up for the huge amount of filler crap in the middle . By then , only my sheer will power kept me playing to the end.Battle System ( 8/10 ) : Nothing really wrong with the battle system . It 's a variant of turn-based , with a small bar in the corner indicating who will go next . While the bar does let you see when you 're characters will go , I did n't really find it all that useful . What keeps this section from a perfect score is the abilities-and how you level them up . Using them over and over again strengthens your magic , but not how you 'd expect . SPEED increases , not strength . I found this very frustrating and pointless . The speed does n't really increase enough to make much difference- and leveling spells takes forever.Gameplay ( 4/10 ) : Was the rotating camera really necessary ? I 've played games with rotating camera angles ( like Xenogears ) that worked just fine , but in this game it does n't . The problem lies in dungeon navigation . If the graphics had been better , or if there had been better dungeon design , perhaps navigation would n't be so confusing . It 's really hard to tell where you are because the dungeon design is so bland and repetitive ; there are usually no landmarks with which to navigate , with the result that I actually wound up back at the entrance thinking it was the exit . On another note , something else that bothered me was the fact that even by the end of the game , you could n't really return to much of anywhere you had been previously . I kept expecting be able to return to Parm eventually , but no such luck . *NOTE : This part 's an extremely important part -- the game is glitchy . It would freeze randomly , forcing me to reset and start over . The cds themselves were in good condition with almost no scratches of any kind , and I 've heard this same complaint before , which leads me to believe the glitches are a flaw of the game design . This is a huge turnoff -- this added in extra frustration to an already boring game . This flaw knocks points off the score.Overall ( 4/10 ) : Note this score is not an average , it 's my subjective overall score . I must say , given the flaws of this game , I 'd never play it again . It 's too bad really , it could 've been a decent game if the makers had cut out the middle of the `` plot '' and fixed the glitches . I really would n't recommend this to anyone unless they absolutely have played every other good RPG out there and are just dying for something else to play . Even then , it may be better to just replay an old favorite instead .	-1
Strange how some people regard Grandia as the best Saturn RPG and one of the best on the PlayStation . While Grandia possesses some interesting qualities , it is completely dismantled by a series of devastating flaws that cripple the game . This review will be formulaic , but it will get the point across.The graphical engine was very good . 2D characters and 3D environments that can be rotated at will . I like nuances , and Grandia possesses many . I like knocking over teapots and making clotheslines as I walk into them . The spell effects were boring , however , and the FMV , while technically good at the time , just was n't exciting.The music is overwrought and almost silly . The main themes seem bombastic and pretentious , as if the game is saying , & quot ; Come look at me , I 'm important ! & quot ; The compositions are impressive musically , but they feel emotionally hollow . There is one song , a piano & amp ; violin duet , which I loved . It was completely gorgeous . I also liked how the combat music changed as the game continued . RPGs often frustrate me by giving me the same combat music through the entire 40 hour game.In Grandia , using specific kinds of magic or weapons makes you more skilled in that capacity . Naive gamers have said that Grandia 's character growth system is innovative and interesting . It is not innovative , in my mind , and not interesting . Such systems have been done in 8-bit Final Fantasy games and reams of Japanese RPG with lower profiles ( the SaGa games come to mind ) . Also , because the game is so long , you 'll probably learn every spell and weapon technique about 50 % though the game . Since this removes any real incentive to engage in combat , all future battles are suffocating in how boring they are.The combat is boring . This is mainly because it is incredibly easy . I did n't spend extra time advancing my characters ( I tried to finish the game ASAP , actually ) , so I definitely was n't too strong . Still , not a single boss offered any form of challenge . Even the final boss felt like nothing more than a ponderous standard encounter . It seems evident to me that a game can not be exciting when there is no threat ... no sense of danger or challenge . This would n't be _that_ bad if the battles did n't take so long . So , you get thousands of long , boring , simple fights over the course of the game . The dungeons are amateur in design , and made about 10 times more dreadful because of the combat . There 's also a gauge in combat that shows when when each character will take an action . However , this does not create any real strategy because all the characters move at different speeds , so it 's just a funky gimmick.The story is not bad , but it is badly told . It uses about every hackneyed Japanese RPG element imaginable , but it does n't remedy this problem with interesting characters or compelling twists . The translation is just dumb . Sony broke it down to simple diction and pure , fatuous juvenalia . The & quot ; romantic & quot ; relationship between Justin and Feena is basically insulting -- it has the maturity of an elementary school infatuation . Sue is an utterly pointless character , who 's involvement in the story is simple arbitrary and ridiculous . What is the creature & quot ; Puffy & quot ; ? The game never explains . I expected some kind of enigmatic quality to the creature , with a revelation disclosing all at some point ( like Nall in Lunar ) . This never happens . It 's stupid . The voice acting is hideous . Attemps at humor fall flat . Attempts at emotional expression are cringe-inducing.The game took me about 50 hours to beat ( though I tend to be slower than some ) . In my mind , the game is about 35 hours too long . So , expect the & quot ; meat & quot ; of the story to be padded with superfluous side-quests packed with obnoxious combat and torturous dialogue . I like side-quests ... when they are optional or purposeful . In this game , the side-quests are neither . Adventures in a ghost ship or on a mysterious prehistoric valley might sound fun on paper , but without important story revelations or fun gameplay , it 's boring . Granted about 10 hours of the game is pretty interesting . But that 's a mere 20 % of the game . In school , that would be an 'F ' ... a FAILING grade.The game is just tedious . It 's boring and insipid and hackneyed to death . I 'm sure there will be many who say , & quot ; Grandia rulez ! you lie ! & quot ; and give me a & quot ; not helpful & quot ; vote . I did n't write this to please anybody ... I wrote it because I think Grandia does not deserve the praise it receives . Heed my word , and perhaps you will save 50 hours of you life . That 's a long time ! 50 Law & amp ; Order episodes ! A genuinely good RPG ! Think about it .	-1
I am a DIE-HARD fan of 2 and also liked 1 . When 3 came out I was with alot of fans in saying WTF is THIS ! ? It was weird jerky , shaky controls , horrible , and obviously rushed graphics , and they messed up all the stories . I feel so bad for Dave Jaffe to have to see his creation ground up , cheeze added and packaged with a brand name and sweettooth 's face . 4 does n't do much better , and yet has a few neat ideas added that make it not as awful and actually worth a bargain bin price.The story is not one of those ideas , although sweettooth in charge was a nice idea , his being a circus mastermind with evil clown minions was retarded and Totally throws him in a different direction then he was meant to be.The `` Create-a-Car '' was a single step in the right direction , although far too shallow , and MAKING you choose one of a handful of STUPID voices [ warcries ] to hear EVERY TIME you shoot your special will `` MAKE YOU SHIVER WHEN I DELIVER '' & lt ; & lt ; one of the warcries you must choose . Although you can make several character cars and then choose them as enemies in a challenge match , that 's a plus since I'ld rather just kill them when I hear their warcry.Bringing back older characters as bosses [ and later playable ] was nice . SUPER Axel , Super Thumper , Super Slamm , and Super Auger [ from TM3 ] . Axel was the most fun of the super characters for me.Another bad idea here , Captain Grimm ? why is the grim reaper of motorcycles a pirate now ? and not even a cool pirate , a cheezy amusement park pirate . well he was n't MY favorite anyhow but I 'm certain that was a deal breaker for all Mr.Grimm fans . Any fans of Rob Zombie would appreciate that he 's brought his Dragula along and is actually a pretty good character.Another interesting twist is that With Sweettooth in charge , Calypso 's pretty pissed , and therefore competing , in a Scud missile truck . his special is to fire a scud into the air and then you bring it back down in a reticle , and it looks a LOT more powerful then it is.I also want to mention the levels here in this one were better then 3 . Of course nothing IN this game was better then the first 2 , but in all Twisted Metal 4 proves to be a worthwhile car combat bargain bin game , but NOT a true Twisted metal Sequel . I gave it 4 fun stars becuase I was amazed how much I actually played it , it does have replay value to it , though $ 20 is still far too much for this .	-1
Some good levels , some good cars . Mostly nothing special , though . If you want a good Twisted Metal game , look elsewhere in teh series . If you want a good vehicular destruction game , look to Vigilante 8 or , better still Interstate 76 or Interstate 82 .	-1
I could n't get passed the first level it is like impossible . You have to like be a pro at the game or somethin	-1
I try to do a trick on the undercover section , but is hard to do that , I try and try but I ca n't even pass the test.This game is not good , the graphic look horrible.yack ! !	-1
There are 5 levels in this game . On my first try I beat 4 levels . It is easy and short ! You also ca n't save the game . If your , let 's say , on level 4 and you lose all your lives . Then you have to start at the begining again . ( Kind of like Mario . ) This is the really bad thing . If you turn off your gameboy and turn it on again , you start at level 1 again . It is not fun to keep playing the same levels over and over . I would say this is for little kids that do not get frustiated easly . ( If there is any little kids like that . ) I say pass this up , Kirby fans , and try another game .	-1
Early Castlevania games tended to be hit or miss affairs , and unfortunately this is . When I originally posted this review in 2003 , I had made a concerted effort to create an honest review for the average player ; I was ( and still am ) quite fond of the game . If I were to redo my rating scale , perhaps I 'd score it slightly higher at three stars . All the same , I still feel that this game provides a low amount of fun given the intense challenge , and the rating is deserved given that overriding criteria.Does n't the classic GB logo give it away ? This is not the fantastic GameBoy Advance title Castlevania : Aria of Sorrow , nor is it Circle of the Moon or even Harmony of Dissonance.What this is might well be described as one of the slowest sidescrollers ever made ( and that 's without slowdown affecting the game ) . Made in 1989 , this is one of the first titles in Konami 's Game Boy lineup and it shows . The level one music ( Battle of the Holy ) is excellent and a personal favorite , but the aural experience is unfortunately quite limited afterward . I personally like many of the background details ( whenever they show up , that is ) such as the trees and graves seen at the game 's beginning . Much later on the ability to use exploding eyeballs as dynamite to open up a hidden area ( no joke ! ) is a great concept well executed.The whip Christopher uses in this game may be upgraded once for a chain whip , and once more for flinging fireballs ... it 's not quite an adequate replacement for the traditional Castlevania subweapons , but it does give you unlimited attacks at range.Christopher 's slowness in this title ( and its sequel ) makes Simon Belmont 's hunched back and slow gait appear like a semi barrelling down the road , whereas Christopher is perhaps the man trying to push a tractor trailer down the road . Suffice to say that he 's very slow - hyperbole aside , he seems to move at roughly half the speed of Simon.The worst part of it would be the intensely difficult jumps found in large quantities . This is the textbook example of frustrating level design : Nearly every single jump must be done within an accuracy of a few pixels . While the most difficult jump in the game requires you time perfectly across two falling platforms-essentially three jumps-is thankfully optional ( used to snag a 1-up extra life ) , since I can only manage it about once in twenty tries ( an optimistic guess ) , the normal jumps are too close to this required accuracy for comfort . One long series of jumps has you going over about a dozen blocks in such a fashion ; while there 's solid ground below to fall down onto and the process of jumping may always be restarted it 's easy to mess up here . A later and quite ugly level where you are chased by spikes for nearly the entire level ( and one part consists of climbing upwards and jumping from rope to rope ) has the same feel to it , as mistakes tend to get you killed quite often.There 's more . One level starts you off by bats which of course you ca n't hit right away because while a Castlevania Axe could take them all out , you have no axe , only your whip . Getting through this section unscathed is more a matter of luck than skill.The end of the game , oddly enough , consists of the easiest Dracula fight since Castlevania 2 ( where you could simply lay on the laurels for invincibility for the fight 's duration ) . I wo n't give it away , but Dracula 's second form is even more pathetic , in terms of an attack pattern , than the first ( in either case , Dracula looks silly in this one ) . Given how hard this game is , though , it 's probably not a bad thing to have some reprieve.Are there any more problems ? Oh yes , the killer : Getting hit downgrades your weapon one notch , so you essentially play the whole game with the basic short leather whip.All that said , I do love this game , but it 's not easily playable . It brings solid graphics to the GameBoy , but the gameplay ... if it is solid , perhaps we would better say that you 'll need a jackhammer to scratch the surface of this particular rock.It gets the second star only because some people consider all terribly difficult games to be a challenge and they might enjoy it somewhat . As I noted , there are some nice points later in the game ... unfortunately , just as with the previous year 's ( 1988 ) Castlevania arcade game ( Haunted Castle ) , most mortals will never see many of its neat details.My recommendation is to pick up Castlevania 2 : Belmont 's Revenge instead . You have subweapons , less difficult jumps , a better soundtrack overall , and weapon downgrades have been checked significantly . Pick that one up if you 're looking for classic GameBoy action !	-1
I usualy like Castlevania games so when I heard of their was one on Gameboy I bought right away . That was ... stupid . But I 'll start with it 's good qualities . It does n't smell . That 's something , right ? Now the bad . You walk REALLY REALLY slow . You attack REALLY REALLY slow . Everything else goes either as fast or faster than you . When you jump accross platforms unless you jump at the very edge of you wo n't make it . The music is just 6 seconds of sound repeated over and over and over and over ... Oh ya , and the graphics look like ... .	-1
No it is n't . This is a standard platformer with extremely sluggish control , no secondary weapons , and slow movement . Plus , your whip loses power each time an enemy hits you . This is a pain . The saving grace is that you can obtain a whip that shoots fireballs and the first stage has GREAT music . But that ca n't save the game . Even CastleVania fans should steer clear of this one .	-1
I do n't know about the other incarnations of Batman Returns , but the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version is downright atrocious . The controls are stiff and slow , Batman himself moves at a snails pace and is frequently unable to move out of the way of oncoming enemies . The sound effects are awful and the combat system is very , very poor . Such a shame consideringBatmanwas so good . Even the music in this one disappoints in comparison to the brilliant tunes in the first game . The only positive thing I can mention about this waste of time and effort are the nice looking graphics which really evoke the gloomy , wintry feel of a frozen Gotham City . Otherwise , avoid !

The Batman Returns game on Nintendo is better than this one . The Sega version is boring and the gameplay is not that good .	-1
this is a good batman game..its just a tad too difficult LOL the graphics are dark and gloomy perfect for batman but they lack the visual detail of the movie but a good job by sega : ) now the super nintendo 's batman returns is a excellent game which i still play to this day..the graphics are well done.. the music is from the movie..and had digitized scenes from the film.. the other batman game that is really done right is by sunsoft .. : Batman the video game '' from the 89 movie again for the genesis.. all in all if your a batman fan get all of these games..	-1
I would say that video games do n't come much simpler than this bore but the likes of Pong and Pac-Man , while less technically sophisticated are still better . Golden Axe 2 is such a chore to play with no fun or enjoyment injected into the proceedings whatsoever.Again , you can choose from barbarian Ax Battler , amazonian Tyris Flare or dwarf Gillius Thunderhead as you slowly plod your way through a generic as hell fantasy kingdom , hacking and slashing at conveyor belt enemies ( who sometimes kill themselves out of sheer stupidity ) before you get to the big guy in a suit of armour who has taken over the land because of his evilness or whatever nonsense.I often associate Golden Axe with Streets of Rage since the gameplay in the first games was very similar ( I also bought them on the same day back in March 1993 ) . But while the SOR series only got better and more sophisticated I am afraid that Golden Axe just got crapper . It tries to be the gaming equivalent of a big budget Conan movie but comes off as no more than a Roger Corman mini-series . You 've never played a game so stripped down and bland as this.Graphics D+Sound D-Gameplay D-Lasting Appeal FPros : It 's a lot like Golden AxeCons : It 's a LOT like Golden AxeSound effects are no more than white noise.Baddies all look the same.No point system.Very , very little in the way of power ups.No combo moves.Collision detection is poor.Music is just ghastly .	-1
Thought this would be a fun , Mario like game . Controls are award and half the buttons are useless . Also Is frustrating in that you can get stuck on a part of level by destroying the blocks you need to jump on . Then , you have to wait till you die or time runs out to retry . Buy an Snes instead with Mario and Zelda .	-1
I used to love this game before he was caught brown handed in the 4 year old chocolate cookie jar . Typical of Michael to make sure he has a fun game for little boys ! Looking at this game now it 's so dirty . You have to run around saving little boys oh yeah girls to . Hmm . Michael did n't like girls but i bet he just did n't wan na look suspicious ! Good by and good riddance !	-1
A 'fun ' arcade game it may well have been in it 's day , but one can not play Moonwalker today without feeling dirty or somewhat guilty . Based on the 'movie ' of the same name , Moonwalker is just as weird , bizarre and outrageously self-glorifying as Wacko Jacko himself.You take on the role of a suspected pedo , dressed in a white gangster suit , who must rescue children ( hidden in closets , drawers , garbage cans ) from the evil Mr. Big . Upon being rescued these kids respond joyously with 'MICHAEL ' , knowing that they are now safe with the King of Pop . You need to rescue all the little sprogs in every level before you meet the end-level boss . But some children are too well hidden.And who IS this Mr. Big exactly . The Jacko of 1989 fighting against a child-napper , who 's motives for stealing kids is unknown in the game , seems prophetic in a split-personality kind of way . Just like in Thriller where he played a ghoulish , inhuman beast , eerily foreshadowing the future.The gameplay itself is ludicrous . As you ( moon ) walk across the various levels ( some generic , some inspired by his 'classic ' music videos ) you 'll encounter baddies like gangsters and zombies and your amazing way of killing them is ... dancing them do death . Seriously ! It 's not Jesus Juice , it 's Jacko Jamming ! You hit the special attack button and Jacko will suddenly yell 'OW ! ' before strutting his lethal stuff . After which , the baddies will be vanquished somehow . After playing this game you 'll be exhilarated and mentally exhausted at Jacko 's killer moves . You 'll be reduced to a dribbling wreck . He 's so good , that even passing-by animals will join in and shake their asses . If you ever wanted to play a game in which even an innocent dog is hypnotised by Jacko into dancing Thriller then this is for you . But I do n't want to know you.The music is no more than low-quality samples of Smooth Criminal and Thriller , as you should know this music follows Jacko everywhere he goes in real life and will change depending on where he is.In the later levels , if you catch a falling star Jacko will turn into a huge robot . Of course . Like in the film , I just ca n't get over the feeling that Jacko only included this because he wants to see himself 100 feet high . It 's ridiculous and has nothing to do with anything ! But in a moronic , hopelessly out-dated video game I suppose it 's okay . It was kind of easy to finish too and I never really played it again afterwards . But these days , it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and I can understand why no one would want to play it again.Graphics CSound CGameplay DLasting Appeal F	-1
Ever since SOR 3 came out in 1994 I wanted it . I never actually managed to get my hands on it until last year as it went for insane prices on auction sites and was very , VERY hard to come by in video game stores . Luckily for me I was given it as a present from someone clearing out their attic . I could n't wait to get home and play it . All I could think about was loads of hours of solid beat-em-up action and a return of those ultra-cool tunes by Yuzo Koshiro that made the first two games so memorable.As soon as I started to play I was shocked that Streets of Rage 3 is actually a really , really bad game that may be impressive in terms of graphics but in regards to music and gameplay is far , far behind even the first.First of all the game is just too damn hard . And you need to play it in hard mode otherwise you wo n't be able to get past level 5 . And this time we 're given a little bit more story and cut-scenes between the game levels . If you 're playing the American or European release of this game I 'd just skip these as they do not make sense and there are holes everywhere . The Japanese version ( Bare Knuckle 3 ) has a different plot entirely and looks and feels like the REAL Streets of Rage 3.In SOR 3 the story has Mr. X , in what limited capacity he now exists in , kidnap the Chief of Police and plant bombs all over city . He wants to replace high-ranking officials with evil robots . Or something ! So , typically , the gang set about smashing the Syndicate AGAIN as their way of stopping him.However , in Bare Knuckle 3 the opening cut-scenes with the nuclear explosion show the destruction of a city called 'Wood Oak ' that was the first victim of a radioactive bomb powered by the newly discovered element 122 , Laxine . The victims are given as an estimated 30,000 dead and 80,000 injured.In a letter from Blaze to Axel she says that the Syndicate 's laboratories seem to be involved in the research of Laxine and that a group in favor of a war with the country of Lima have captured the army general Petrov.Mr . X tries to start a nuclear war by replacing the anti-war U.S. General with Shiva before a speech at the White House . In SOR 3 'City Hall ' looks suspiciously like the White House so I 'm led to believe that the level was just recycled and renamed.In Bare Knuckle 3 you have to successfully prevent a devastating war by rescuing the general and the destruction in the city is just a slap in the face , while in SOR3 you basically have failed your task if you let the time run out ( the General , now 'Chief of Police ' is killed with poisonous gas ) . If you rescue the Chief in time you go straight to Mr.X 's island lab , but if he dies you go to City Hall/White House.Second , Yuzo Koshiro 's music is HORRIBLE . What happened ? The first 2 games had awesome music that showed what the meager Sega Genesis was capable of . The man was truly a pioneer when it came to composing stunning music for simple machines . In SOR 3 there are no cool tunes at all . It 's all pathetic , tepid Industrial junk that would sound rancid coming from an Atari . A MAJOR let-down considering how amazingStreets of Rage Twowas.SOR 3 also has deleted characters that feature only in the Japanese version . Namely the character of 'Ash ' who looks very , very homosexual and resembles Bennett from Commando or one of The Village People . I guess the PC Powers That Be thought the Western World could n't handle such obvious gayness . The dialogue is also censored and 'naughty ' words are replaced with 'clean ' words . Character names are also radically and inexplicably different.If you want this badly then the Japanese version is the ONLY way to go . Seriously , it 's a complete disappointment otherwise . I 'm not saying that the Japanese version is great , it 's only slightly better .	-1
Streets Of Rage 3 . Oh boy . STREETS OF F ** * **G RAGE PART 3 . You know Sega Of America just butchered this game for The US & European Megadrive owners . Sega took this gamesb all s away censoring the way some of the female gang members are dressed . They took out a funny sub boss . Even Segas crew e d with the gameplay like when I run up to an enemy & hit a Grand Upper as Axel sometimes it does n't hit . Oh & Axel does n't say Grand Upper he says `` BARE KNUCKLE '' in 35 or 40 year tobacco chewer . There 's a review I did on an older account where I was more positive that 's before I got my hands on a copy of Bare Knuckle III the uncut Japanese version . The Japanese version plays better feels faster paced . The only reason that I could think that Sega would dumb the story down & censor stuff is cause around this time a group of Authoritarian Democrats had some hearings about violent video games that 's the only reason I could think of why they would mess this game up so bad . These lawmakers wasted money during these hearings they went after poor Bill White of Sega I mean they just picked on this guy for no reason . Anyway Sega Of America was probably afraid that Big Bad Herbie Kohl would go after them . Oh btw no matter what party your Congressman or Woman , Senator or Governor are if they are an authoritarian try to get theira * * voted out . I 'm sorry if I got too political but moving on I beat if you 're reading this I bet you never expected to read a political rant with in a game rant . The story is stupid in The NTSC PAL version so skip it if you 're playing The NTSC PAL versions & be prepared to get beaten up a lot . The Bare Knuckle III storyline dealt with terrorism they 've totally destroyed a city call Wood Oak City that 's part of the The Lima Nations Mr X has this chemical called Rakushin 122 he 's trying to supply The Lima Nations with it so he can make a lot of money there 's a General named Petrov who is against these Lima Nations going to war so The Syndicate has captured him . In The US PAL versions well The Chief has been kidnapped & Mr X is going to replace high ranking city & police officials replaced by robots . The American & European versions is basically a generic Beat Em Up I mean I could do without the plot cause it 's some kind of BS out of a Saturday Morning Cartoon . If it did n't have Axel , Blaze & Skate returning this game could 've been called something else . Adam also returns in a couple of cameos so he 's not playable he figures into the plot in both SOR 3 & Bare Knuckle III . They 've changed the color of clothing the characters Axel wears a yellow shirt & black jeans . Blaze wears a white shirt & white shirt . Cause Sega says they were being gender neutral more like they were being politically correct . Sega took out the original opening there 's cut scenes with dialogue but scenes the Sega rewrote all these cut scenes before & after each level skip it I do n't even know why they left it in cause none of it makes sense . The 1st level it starts off with a bomb being defused also you 'll notice at the character select screen the music is mediocre . Anyway level 1 is starts off in this warehouse where you have 3 sections a warehouse , dock & an alley where you fight a returning Shiva . You have new enemies such as these assassin that wear suits & shoots you punks that dress like Justin Bieber which gives me more of a reason to beat these dudes up as well as mowhawk punks . You have these female enemies that with blond brush cut haircuts who have been censored so have the whip ladies instead of their revealing clothes they wear jackets , skirts , pantyhose & high heels . I do n't mind the music on this level it 's not Streets Of Rage 2 music or even the 1st game for that matter it 's not as bad as some of the music later on . After the 1st level Blaze knows where the 2nd bomb is at level 2 starts out downtown at this shopping district where you have Biker 's & yellow jacket mowhawk punks after you along with your basic punks . You have an evil psycho clown & Kangaroo as the sub boss if you beat the clown 1st then you 'll get The Kangaroo as a playable character yep they wo n't let you play as Adam or bring Max back but you can play as a Kangaroo . The 2nd section is in this Disco which is was pretty good you have to go through your basic punks & mowhawk punks Blond Brush Cut Girls & whip ladies . The Boss of level 2 is Mona & Lisa they 're the returning Blaze clones from SOR 1 only they 're not Blaze clones & they 're not as difficult as in SOR 1 . The music in The Disco is ok as was the boss music . At the end of level 2 there 's a news segment going on where you 're told that Axel has kidnapped The Chief which I think if Sega had to change the story make where Axel has been framed for kidnapping The Chief & he has to go along with the team to find The Chief & so he can clear his name they might have been too mature though . Level 3 is where the music goes tos # * t you 're in this construction site where you fight off yellow jacket mowhawk punks with the various punks & guys dressed as Justin Bieber I guess that 's a reason to play it you get to beat up dudes dressed as Justin Bieber & he is a punk . You have the chicks with whips & the ladies with brush cuts . You can also knock them into pits which is fun if you can pull it off in this version cause you 'll get beat on a lot . 2nd section where you have a black Doug Funny punk trying to kill you with a Bulldozer & you have some really awful music like someone put their hand under the armpit put it up to the recorder & made f art in g noises . WTF Yuzo Koshiro . You have to fight off The Bulldozer while smashing a brick wall if you get to the end the black Doug Funny will crash a barrel will fall on top of him killing him then the 3rd section is on this lift which playing this again I was burnt out on this game that does n't happen with Bare Knuckle III I can sit beat that game . This section has more of the same enemies but it introduces a newer Samuri type kung fu villain & they 're more of a challenge than what they were in part 2 . The Boss of Level 3 is Robot Axel . Level 4 is in this tunnel you 'll probably die a lot here cause there is this this Subway Cart that comes through in Bare Knuckle III I do n't get hit a lot by it . In the 2nd section you wo n't have to you have to fight off these Ninja 's that have returned you wo n't have to worry about a The Subway Cart hitting you cause you can go in this corner & let it pass sometimes it will hit the enemies . The music in the 2nd section of level 4 sounds like something that would be used in a 70 's Cat Food Commercial . The Boss of level 4 called Yamota you have to defeat 3 of them & this boss fight is fun in Bare Knuckle III in Streets Of Rage 3 it 's the longest boss fight of the entire franchise I 'm not joking the boss music used is some of the better in the game . Level 5 you go through The Syndicate Hide Out where it 's in about 3 or 4 sections the 1st section is you have to fight through Ninja 's & Samuri 's The 2nd section is in some kind of hallway with a great tune it 's 1 of the few I like where you fight your basic punks yellow jacket , red & blue jacket mowhawk punks the fat guys are back as well as more Samuri 's . The 3rd section is on an elevator where you fight off punks brush cut chicks & whip ladies & basic punks you get to the top floor where Axel has words with Mr X you fight off some more punks & whip ladies . Mr X stands up catches fire & it 's a robot & if you beat Robo X & you 're playing on easy you 're f * *k you go play on harder difficulty . When I saw this back in the day I was like wtf ? I was n't aware of the level select cheat back in the day or the 9 lives cheat . So the game wants to play Clue with you but I 'm not wanting to play clue I want to play Streets Of Rage 3 . So however you get to level 6 you have to save The Chief from being gassed to death you have to destroy 2 control panels you have these hopping robots they are not as fun as in Streets Of Rage 2 . But you have to take a lift to get to these 2 lower floor each control panel is in the 2nd room on the 2 lower floors . The rooms contain whip ladies & Samuri 's . You have to save The Chief cause The Syndicate has sent a disguised Chief to make a statement at Mayor 's Mansion If you do n't get to The Chief in time then you take an alternate route going to The Mayor 's Mansion which looks more like The White House . The level 6 boss is the return of the jet pack guy who is backed up by 2 extra jet pack men . He provides a better challenge though . You can beat them with jump attacks & special moves . Adam makes a cameo where he guns down the jet pack men at the end of the boss fight . If you save The Chief then you 'll go on the right route where the 1st section starts off outside your fighting off Ninja 's hopping robots & Biker 's this is very annoying . The Factory is the same where you got Mr X robots then you have to fight off hopping robots a Mr X 's Assassins & a jet pack guy . Then you have a sort of sub boss a Scientist named Dr Dahm trying to kill you with lab equipment . You have to jump attack it . All this stuff is fun & challenging in Bare Knuckle III . You face a very difficult robot controlled by what 's left of Mr X all that 's left is his brain . Now in both Bare Knuckle III & Streets Of Rage 3 this is hard but it 's a fun challenge . You have to beat the Neo X in 3 minutes if you have defeated him after the 3 minutes have passed you 'll get a bad ending telling how you failed & try again . If you defeat it before the 3 minutes passed you 'll get the good ending & all I can say is keep using your special attack on Neo X. Adam gets you out of their on a helicopter after the battle . I 'm going to wrap this up by saying Streets Of Rage 3 really bad a story that 's not needed since Sega of America messed up The NTSC PAL versions . Most of the music is bad other than the redone Streets Of Rage theme I like the music in level 5 section 2 the music in level 7 B where you 're at The White House is my favorite on this game & The round 4 boss music is really good . I can just listen to those tracks on You Tube or in the options menu . I have heard Streets Of Rage 3 did n't do well I mean just look at the cover I mean The US Box Art for SOR 1 & 2 is bad but for SOR 3 it 's terrible Axel & Blaze look like they 're in they 're in their 40 's Axel looks like he 's put on weight . Zan looks dumb & The Kangaroo is on the cover it looks so laughable . If I would 've saw this in a store I would 've been like wtf & it probably got a bad word of mouth . Anyway next review will be the real Streets Of Rage 3 Bare Knuckle III .	-1
I could n't stand this game.This was NOTHING compared to S of R and S o R 2.The gameplay was super fast and it was alot harder too.The soundtrack in this game was totally lame.Once again , NOTHING compared to the first two games of the trilogy.The characters you choose from are about the same.Except there is no Adam again ( which sucks big time ) and no Max Thunder either ( which REALLY sucks ) All there is , is some old dude who is a human-robot or something.I do n't even know what the hell this thing even is.Anyway , the graphics are about the only good thing that I would say this game 's got going for it.Overall , I would recommend avoiding this one , and just pick up Streets Of Rage and Streets Of Rage 2 .	-1
X-Men is a fun game ... on ameatur difficulty level . When I cranked it up to Hero ( since you ca n't get any farther than the third level on ameatur ) , I found it almost impossible to do anything . I got tired of playing the levels all over again , fighting the same , almost randomly apearing enemies coming from doors at any moment and surrounding me . Although the game may have captured the feel of the X-Men , I did n't think they did a good job with the actual game aspect , which is probably the most important thing . If you want to play a good Marvel game , try Marvel Super-heroes : war of the Gems . It is much more balanced and fun than Sega 's attempt at making an X-men game .	-1
I know this is going to sound like sacrilege but I was never a fan of the Mortal Kombat games . Having playedStreet Fighter II ' Special Champion EditionandFatal Furybefore it I just did n't see much point in another fighting franchise.Plus , the digitised graphics , which were supposed to be 'groundbreaking ' and make us all go 'ooohhh , ahhh ' were just really rubbish . They were so blocky and resembled just a few big , chunky pixels vaguely in the shape of a human . I tired of it pretty quickly I 'm afraid to say but a few months after I stopped playing it I went back after finding cheat codes in a magazine to restore the censored gore . But even that was dumb ! A gallon of blood splattered into the air every time you punched someone and it just looked so stupid that it had no edge . And then later on I got the cheats for the finishing moves and 'babalities ' and 'animalities ' or whatever such nonsense . But by that point they just took it too far and I never went back to it again . The sequels never took my interest either.Not the best fighting game by far.Graphics CSound CGameplay CLasting Appeal C+	-1
THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST VERSIONS OF THE ORIGINAL GAME YOU CAN BUY . THE GRAPHICS ARE HORRIBLE , THE FIGHTS ARE BORING , AND THIS VERSION JUST LACKS THE DEPTH OF THE SUPER NINTENDO VERSION . ONLY REASON I DO N'T GIVE THIS THING 1 STAR IS BECAUSE OF THE CODE THAT YOU CAN USE TO UNLOCK THE GORE AND THE FATALITIES THAT ARE N'T FOUND ON THE OTHER VERSION . BUT OTHER THAN THAT , STICK WITH THE FAR SUPERIOR SUPER NINTENDO VERSION . THIS VERSION AI N'T WORTH LOOKING FOR .	-1
this controller is really a bad idea on segas part , the six button is much more user friendly especially to anyone who enjoys fighting games ( such as myself ) given i do own a pair of these , i never use them , use my six buttons even on three button compatable games because the only difference is you dont use the x y z buttons lol , plus on any six button genre games that incorporated the using start button to swap the threes functions you loose the pause feature , defanatly not the best controller for the genesis	-1
I recieved the controller on time , how ever it is not fully functional , only the directional key works , and the start button works from time to time , the other three buttons are not working at all . probaly should have gone with a replica , however i 'll give it another shot and order another form another Amazon supplier.. Good luck to us all who put our money and faith into second hand material .	-1
Are you people stupid when it comes to telling what games are good and what games totally suck ? ! I love the original Doom , but this shooter does a terrible job at ripping Doom off . The graphics are n't good for their time ! Hell , the Genesis has way better looking games than this . It 's like when I look at this game I 'm reminded of vomit . Why ? Picture this : a friend has just barfed , and to make fun of the situation you try and find what the colorful chunks of vomit look like . Hell , even with the radar screen you have to literally squint to see where the enemies are at because the graphics are so horrible and ugly ( come to think of vomit , if you have problems with games with horrible graphics that cause you to get sick , you will barf a storm ) . Plus , this game was made in 1994 and has perhaps some of the worst graphics ever . Doom was released in 1992 , and the graphics still hold well to this day . The controls are crappy , the music is God-awful along with the graphics , and this is one of the worst shooters I 've ever played . So whatever you do do n't buy this f***ing awful game . Also worth mentioning , the graphics are so bad to point of where it looks worse than an NES game .	-1
I 've played a lot of games that to this day can be considered old . Some of them have aged well thanks to their long lasting charms and innovations , but from this I 've earned an experience : I have learned that if the opening music to the game is astronomically good , it 's a bad game . Few games apply to this rule , but it is still present particularly in long forgotten manure fests like Deep Blue for the Turbo Grafix 16 ... and this game.Right out , the game starts with an incredible opening song , one that sounds catchy , jazzy and dire all at the same time . Then you actually play the game and see the graphics and the hook has dislodged itself from your interest.I 'm not going to say that the graphics are bad , especially not at a first glance , but SA uses a very dull color palette consisting of almost limelight tints where the shirts of thugs will appear too green for their own good and the palette loves to over-use the color gray ... a lot . You 'll encounter a lot of gray backgrounds in this game save for maybe the park levels which actually resemble forests.The game play on the other hand is criminal . I do n't want to sound like the average game whiner that whines about older games and how hard they were , but I know when a game is being unfair and when I just suck at a game and SA takes the former in astronomic measurements . I never thought Venom or Spidey could take so much damage from wimpy looking thugs , athletic gymnast women who use their hair as whips and headband wearing drunks armed with flintlocks ( yes , I 'm serious ) .The enemies in this game are a pain . Some of them are really cheap particularly the wimpy , saggy-shorts jerks in the first level that leap at you from across the screen and the aforementioned gymnasts , but they only get more cheap from there , especially when they throw in guys with Cable-like guns and Iron Man wannabes.I think my favorite boss in the whole game was the first level boss ; he 's one of the cheapest bosses you 'll encounter , but the animation for him ( or it , it 's a robot , really ) is SO funny that it 's actually cute . It 's like watching a cat walk over the dried surface of a previously rain-proof coated deck as they shake their paws of the sticky feeling before taking another step , it 's that funny.You can climb on walls in some levels , but your movement is restricted to the level . Of course , speak of the devil and he shall appear ... let 's talk about the real nightmare in this unconscious dream state of a game ( that analogy sucks ) : The levels are long , samey brawler levels consisting of streets , a forest-like park , a bridge and a factory and you 're going to run through each one for what feels like five minutes straight encountering the exact same enemies and occasionally having the choice of taking different paths which wastes time more than the average game should.None of this is helped by the looped music of each level with only three level songs total ; imagine playing through eight levels with only three different songs over and over again , all of which are dwarfed by the opening song that first played.You do get additional help in the game such as Marvel cameos who come out of nowhere once you pick up their icon , but sometimes they do n't really help you ; some of them have very specific reasons to help you like clearing the screen of enemies or blocking projectiles and in most cases they 'll just run on screen , do something for a few seconds , disappear and leave you to continually get your posterior slammed into chewed gum.And if you 're hoping the ending and final boss is worth encountering , they really are n't . I 'd say buy it for the opening music or a goofy gold robot , but are any of those really valid reasons ? I think I 'd rather re-coat the deck , wait for it to dry , find any spots that still have those dried , but sticky patches on them and have the cat walk over it again ... and to add , I 'll join in the fun by walking with her barefoot.If you want game with your nihilism however , then come get some .	-1
This game has seen its life . It lacks the motivation and breath-taking function of others of its genre here on 2009 . I find Clocktower for the SNES to be more entertaining.-The graphics-Fuzzy character sprites , blood that is so cheap that it looks like red paint ? Resident Evil took a whipping in the visual department . The zombies look like Re-Deads . And a brownish/black fuzzy blob is not scary , it 's funny . There 's been games like Tomb Raider and Croc that visually look better yet they are both PS1 games.Like a Sweet Home spinoff , Resident Evil starts out with very little weapons , but with scarce ammo . The one major difference between these two however , are the controls.That 's right , i 'm talking about button-busting control schemes . All the earlier RE games have an annoying tendency of allowing the character to die , a lot . When other games came out ( and before ) the controls were smoother , RE insisted that the characters turn painfully slow away from an approaching zombie , just giving the zombie enough ample-time to latch on to have lunch , breakfast , and dinner.Now what 's so scary about this game ? Is it given that M-ratings were considered 'rare ' back on the PS1 ? The script ? Or 'knowing ' some zombie is gon na come out of that hallway sooner or later ? The game starts with the player arriving on the grounds of the mansion ( in a grainy video ) then inside . Immediately there is conversation . The voice-acting is dull , un-lively and boring . Do I care that there 's blood on the floor ? No , why ? because it looks like paint , that 's why ! Do n't mind the plain-in-sight dead-body laying in the corner there , it 's decor ! Or not . Again , the voice-acting is as bland and convincing as a monologue broken-record . Ahh . Something 's there . Ahhhhh . Bad acting produces bad results.Given that it was the first RE game may be the reason for its praising , considering both it 's puzzle-like feature of finding items/unlocking rooms and of course , the zombies in a squashed polygon-rendered environment . But by today 's standards ( Fallout 3 anyone ? ) this game simply does n't cut it . Silent Hill has a remake of it 's first game , it may be worth a try . But as for RE 1 original , it 's a rent . Try the other games before considering this .	-1
this collection of games were okay , the best one out of them all was super packman . the rest were not worth playing . : (	-1
This game is a monsterous disaster . Even if it was rare , I do not understand how anyone could have possible considered paying as much as $ 100 for this game.The gameplay mechanics were borrowed from its 2D predecessors ; however , the conversion into 3D was horrible . The game moves slow , the graphics are mediocre at best , the difficulty can be overwhelming at times , controls were shoddy , the game had horrible load times considering there were better games that also loaded for that period of time -- the only good that I really saw in the game was that it stayed true to the series and featured a good sized cast of characters spanning from the Dragon Ball all the way through GT ( But NOT every character and there was n't much of a STORY per se existent in this game ) .Breakdown-The Good : -A huge roster of the Dragon Ball Universe warriors-Retains the original voices from the show-nice CutsceneThe Bad : -The Graphics-The Gameplay-The Framerate-The price -- especially when the game first went out of print	-1
Below are the differences between the Japanese and American releases.1 . The Biggest Fight intro song was replaced with some crappy instrumental that sounds like a boss theme Sound effects were in The Japanese version but were n't present in the US one2 . the Graphics are pretty good but I have one problem you have to jam on the buttons to get the characters to move quick3.cast of characters with Biggest fight Playing is missing at the end and The credits The Japanese one Hironobu Kageyama is singing in the end credits while the US just replaced it with an instrumental of the same song . I do n't know why they could n't use the instrumental of the biggest fight I found hidden on the disc itself for the intro.4 . the voice acting is awful I know this was rereleased but could n't they redub it with the Funimation actors instead of those Mediocre ones . Japanese the original voices from the original anime .	-1
are we asking for to much like better music and a story line ive played games that had none all i cared about was fighting a game like this should be more responcive when you move but why dose everyone buy the japanese version the us version has a girila in the cover if you dont have the patients to learn to teleport figure out what moves combo then dont buy it remember this game dosnt have a strategy guide iether it came with a booklet or it didnt and the booklet dosnt list all the moves	-1
If this was a launch title for the Playstaion 1 than one could guarentee that the system would be in the garbage bin along with Atari Jaguar and Virtual Boy . This game is so horrible and unplayable that it is an embarassment to fighting games . I will go out on a limb and say that this is the single worst fighting game I have ever played.The idea behind this game is that there are a cast of Dragon BAll GT characters all fighting it out . There is no plot to speak of in this game and for most ( outside of super obsessed fans who know extreme details of every character ) they would out this game shortly after the first fight or two.This comes down to my biggest complaint about this game , the controls . With any video game you need to have responsive controls . You do n't get that here . There is no combo system to speak of which even early fighting games held ( although did not go acknowledge ) . Here is the idea of a typical fight on easy . 1 : Fight Begins 2 : You move forward to attack in which you move painfully slow 3 : You hit kick , ten seconds pass and your character does the move 4 : Your opponent is hit and fights back 5 : Using the dash button you slowly move out of the way 6 : You go to use a special ( which seems to be insta kill ) , only to have it countered and you lose 7 : Controller then shatters on TV screen in utter frustration . This is an example of a fight that lasts possible a minute . Like I said the controls are the worst I have ever seen.I feel sorry for those who shell out X amount of dollars on this garbage and I challenge any one out there to give some reason at why this game is supposivly good . Grand THeft Auto 2 has passed it 's mantle as worst game of all time to this game , this is no buried treasure , this is no lost artifact or holy grail , this game is plain and simple garbage .	-1
I have been playing video games my entire life and this game is the worst game I have ever played . You ca n't walk two steps without fighting an enemy and it takes hours to go through one very small castle because of this . The gameplay is horrid , and boring , the music is painfully redunant . Everything about this game sucks ! I threw it in the trash !	-1
you create things.That 's about it.You also fight these little flying lizard-things that pour our of a hole in the ground until you build a building over it.This game will keep you entertained for about an hour , then it gets boring quickly.My advice is to rent the game before buying it .	-1
I usually break down every game that I review from story to sound to controls and yada yada . This game will not require such a breakdown being an old school SNES plat-former in the vein of a really bad Castlevania . Allow me to be more specific as I mentioned in the title that the controls are terrible . By terrible I do n't mean if you press forward the character moves backward , of course not . If you press forward your character will move forward , and if you press attack he will attack . The problem is when you move him forward he sluggishly moves forward as he does n't seem to be a very motivated statue possessed by a god . I would have liked the flight mechanic much more if they utilized it more in the style of Demon 's Crest . The problem might have been that this game came out before Demon 's Crest , so did n't have much influencing it in that department . You do n't really fly with those wings , but rather glide . And you usually glide right into fifty enemies attacking you at once causing the game to slow down significantly . Or you usually end up missing a platform as a result that even if you do end up landing on your character has to cartoonishly put on the brakes the second he lands and slides forward a bit . The enemies respawn especially at the most inconvenient moments , and at times they even respawn right where you 're standing so there 's no way you can avoid them at times . I know people like a challenge to their gameplay , but there 's the difference between a legit challenge and just plain cheap deaths . If you want a legit challenge save another $ 15 and get Castlevania IV if you do n't already have it . I know someone is going to find this review unhelpful just for the fact that 's it a negative review . There are some praiseworthy elements in this game , such as the visuals . The graphics and backgrounds are beautiful for a 16 bit game and would n't look any better even if you added another 16 bits to them ( that 's 32 for those bad at Math , which consist of most Playstation 1 games ) . It 's a game that is definitely at home on 16 bit consoles , but the gameplay just is n't up to par . It is possible to get good at this game and beat it , as it is n't completely unplayable . The problem is you 'll end up losing your voice from cursing at the game before you actually end up getting good at it . I just do n't think it 's a game that 's worth spending a lot of time and effort to playing when the SNES has a vast library filled with much better games . Buyer beware that if you end up purchasing this game you might be stuck with it and not like it . Try the ROM for yourself first . This is n't a worthy successor to the original , and it 's part of the reason why another ActRaiser game has n't been made since . This is n't one of those diamonds in the rough , so just glance past this abomination of a sequel and stick with the predecessor . No hard feelings toward anyone who does like this game .	-1
If you were expecting anything like the first game , you will be disappointed . What I especially did not like was the lack of the Sim-city mode . It 's all action/side-scrolling now . The first Actraiser had interesting side-scrolling levels with a nice array of challenges and enemies . The levels in Actraiser 2 are just frustrating . There 's nothing wrong with a challenge , but the level of challenge even in Easy mode is so ridiculous it 's discouraging . There 's nothing wrong with losing lives while trying to figure out a level , but it takes so many attempts to go through a level because the enemies keep coming at you . Trying to work out a strategy to deal with enemies becomes time-consuming , and after you beat one level , you know you 're going to have to do it all over again with another level . The time spent trying to master one level sucks all the fun out of the game . If you 're a masochist who enjoys being frustrated , this is your game ! Otherwise , avoid .	-1
I have to say the first Actraiser was a classic but Actraiser II is trash ! The wings might be the most annoying feature in fight mode . Do not buy this game !	-1
The gameplay is horrid , the graphics sucks for SNES and it 's just very very boring to play .	-1
This was ONE OF THE WORST GAMES i 've ever seen in my life next to Operation Europe and Populous . If your curious , thinking this looks like mario , well its not . Far from such Greatness as Donkey Kong or mario . i played this game for 20 mins the day i got it and aint touched it since . The Nes versions of Adventure island are alot better and more fun than this game . Buy them , But Please , unless you truly wish to own it for being an SNES version of the NES Classic , dont buy it . its nothing like it . It is an oversized half naked fat man that resembles nothing to the Classic Mr. Higgins . Your nowhere near as small as you used to be on the NES and your hathcets just dont throw like they used to . this game was definately made on a low budget and quickly produced for Quick Income . However , i consider it one of the Few SNES Flops . The only reason it truly sold was because people thought it was going to be like the original NES Version , only to find out when they got home teary eyed that ITS NOT . And it definately aint worth good ends neither . When you jump on the game He looks as though he 's been busted by the police or going in to convulsions or something ... Rather confusing exactly WHAT it looks like hes doing . The Graphics are good , but the controls are not smooth and Gets Repetitive extremely fast , Leadin to Boredom , and eventually getting trashed .	-1
For those of you who had fond memories of the classic arcade game , Captain America and the Avengers , STEER clear of this port that came out for the SNES during its heyday . This was doomed from the get go.First off , the game was made by Mindscape ( who did not have a great track record when it came to video games ) and not by Data East , the original developer of the arcade game . Second , the graphics and music were downgraded significantly to accommodate the low ROM space of the SNES cartridge , which ended not looking or sounding great . Lastly , the controls were so rigged and stiff that moving around and fighting your enemies were extremely limited.As a twist of irony , this was later released for the Genesis by Data East , with graphics , sounds , controls and difficulty mirroring the arcade version.My best friend picked this up and I played it several times trying to get myself to enjoy this game but I did n't . Get the Genesis version or track down the ROM to play this on an emulator because the SNES version was butchered beyond relief . Save your money and do n't buy it ! !	-1
the game is pretty cheap and you cant realy do much because the game does all of the fighting for u kind of depressing	-1
So this game sucks . THe only good things about it are the music when you are playing ( which is ghetto but awesome ) , and the fact that you can run into impossibly strong panther heads that shoot lasers from their eyes . Seriously , do n't waste more than like $ 1 or 2 on this game..	-1
Though any SNES game bearing the title `` Final Fantasy '' can now be called a collector 's item , this is definitely the least sought after of the bunch . This is a hard game to appreciate having experienced parts 4 and 6 , but for younger gamers , this is the perfect game . The story is strictly storybook-standard fodder , non-violent and pleasing to simple minds . The graphics and music are not even worth mentioning , as they can not rightfully be called Final Fantasy material.But considering the target market , it would be unfair to totally trash this game . If I had a son , I would get this game for him as an into into RPGs . The better installments could wait . I would n't call this game the `` Worst RPG Of All Time '' , since I have played much , much worse .	-1
I know there 's some of you who 'd like to see this game get 1 star , but come on , it 's not THAT bad . For example , the music , although not excellent throughout , is pretty good . My favorites are the Volcano , Boss , and Gale Mountain themes . The Boss theme is ESPECIALLY good , though , one of the best I 've heard . I know that many of you complain , & quot ; Oh , I do n't like the random battles. & quot ; Well let me ask you this : Would you prefer 10 ( TEN ) MANDATORY battles on the world map before you can go on to the next area ? I did n't think so . The dungeons and caves are a different story , though , as you can avoid most enemies ( they appear onscreen ) -- unless you 're going down a one-way tunnel . So the battles are a mixed bag , as you can see . Next , being a very early SNES title , the graphics and story are very bland -- compared to later Squaresoft titles . Amazingly enough , I 'm GLAD that Squaresoft made this game . Yes , GLAD . Why ? Because when a system first comes out , companies are n't too sure what the full potential of that system is . Would n't it be dreadful if Squaresoft tried to put their BEST storyline , characters , music , gameplay , you name it , into this first game -- only to realized that the SNES ca n't handle it , or that they could have done better later on ? So I guess you could call this an EXPERIMENTAL Squaresoft game , just a way of sticking one 's toe in the water . And before you start slapping your green numbers down in front of the cashier or reaching for the DOWNLOAD button , I suggest that you read other reviews -- do a Google search or something -- beforehand .	-1
Some might say that to compare Final Fantasy : Mystic Quest to the rest of the series is unfair , since it was clearly aimed at a younger audience . However , when you use a brand name to sell a product , the product had better live up to that name . This game is not a Final Fantasy game , and only a complete FF completist should own it . It takes under 10 hours to beat , and even a six year-old could probably beat it . That 's pretty much the point of it . Final Fantasy II and III for the SNES are far , far better than this monstrosity , and they still remain my two favorite games of all time . Save your money and buy those instead .	-1
This really is n't a part of the Final Fantasy series . It 's just labeled as such so it would sell better here in the US . And yes ... you can really jump in this game ...	-1
This is the black sheep of the Final Fantasy family . It is barely mentioned in any discussion about Final Fantasy and there is a very good reason . This is the worst game that I have played that actually bears the Final Fantasy name . Simply put : this game is not good . By the time this game was released , Squaresoft had give us a simplified version of Final Fantasy IV and called it Final Fantasy II . FFII was more complex and had a deeper story than Mystic Quest . The American audience had proven that we could handle more complex RPGs , but the next Final Fantasy we got was the children 's game Mystic Quest.I finished Mystic Quest the first time in about 8-9 hours ( at most ) , and after that I could beat the game in less than 6 hours . Had there been an actual story to the game , this would have been just a warm-up , but instead the game was complete . Mystic Quest would have worked better as a side scrolling adventure RPG rather than a straight RPG . As it stands , the game is closer in feel to Final Fantasy Adventure for the Gameboy than any Final Fantasy in the numbered series . The story is simple : gather crystals and save the world ( okay , FF I and IV had this story , too ) . The gameplay was far too easy . Most enemies would go down in one or two hits , and you can just fly through the game learning some spells and whacking enemies.My description is n't quite doing justice to how dull the game is and how little fun it is to play . Because of the weakness of this game , the only positive is that the game is so short . If you must play it , go into it with no expectations . If you want to play a good SNES RPG , try Final Fantasy II or III , or Chrono Trigger . If you do play this game , remember to use the Cure spell on the final boss . It makes life easier .	-1
It takes two hits to kill every enemy , except bosses . The undead bosses take one hit -- one cureall spell . If your age is in the double digits in years , this game will probably be too simple for you . NOT RECOMMENDED .	-1
Maybe that 's a little unfair . I 'm admittedly not a big Final Fantasy fan ( Square has made some other stuff which I enjoy ) . The FF series is mostly okay , but Mystic Quest is terrible.Mystic Quest was , as far as I know , a pitiful attempt by the Japanese dominated market of the time to create a 'trainer ' RPG for stupid Americans . Those stupid Americans were woefully underestimated.Mystic Quest has a plot more suitable for a side-scroller than an RPG : Find the four crystals and kill the main bad guy , and thereby save the world . That 's about it . The standard talking and house invasion system is used , but nobody really has anything to say.There is a small assortment of friendly characters who join your party at the game 's discretion . They do n't really have much to say , either . The one guy is a ninja , I guess , which is nice . He was my favorite.The combat system is nothing , just straight turn-based attack button pressing . You can also cast one of a small number of spells , using a system in which you can cast a certain number of each spell type ( white , black ) , rather than using magic points . Also , for some reason , unless you change it , your HP are represented by bars rather than numbers . Between towns , you fight in arenas ( by the way , there is no wandering in the wilderness ) which are boring , but you get prizes , so I did them anyway . There are also only random encounters in some of the dungeons , and set monsters is the others ( one is even a mixture of the two ) . Do n't ask why . Having mostly non-random monsters earns Mystic Quest its first star.The graphics are downright bad , but I 've come to expect that from old games . They are n't too much worse than , say , FFIV . The music , on the other hand , is great for old school stuff . Good enough to earn Mystic Quest its second star.Anyways , Mystic Quest is awful , though almost comparable to FFIV , but much worse . Maybe it is good for training people into RPG 's . Someone who is young and has n't played any RPG 's . Maybe . It took me ten hours to beat , but could be done in five if you did n't mess around . Take some advice from someone who paid 10 $ for Mystic Quest : If you ca n't find it for [ money ] $ or less , do n't bother .	-1
This was , without a doubt the worst Final Fantasy game that I 've ever played . Even Final Fantasy II had it 's moments , but this game just annoyed me ... The same great music you remember is here , but everything else was left at the curb . Fuzzy-looking graphics , characters lacking any sort of personality or conviction , overly simplistic storyline , these are just afew words I would use to describe this game.And it 's not just that this game is lame in comparison to other Final Fantasy games ! On the contrary , this was the first Final Fantasy game that I ever played , and if it were n't for the fact that I had already ordered Final Fantasy IV online , then this game would 've stopped me from ever buying another one ever again.The only thing that I actually liked about this game is that monsters showed visible damage once their health was decreased past it 's half way point , wish they would 've put that into other Final Fantasy games ... Other than that , this game should be avoided ... You 're better off spending your money on another Final Fantasy game . Whichever one you choose , it 's sure to be better than this .	-1
This game is the worst final fantasy game I 've ever had the misfortune to play . The bad graphics are only masked by the horrific gameplay & loss of convincing Heros , not to mention the absence of convincing story-lines that made the Final Fantasy series such a huge hit ! The only fantasy that comes to mind when playing this game is the fantasy of killing yourself or throwing it out the window and praying to God for the souls of the people who put this game on the market . I warn all new-comers to the final fantasy world : DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME ! If your looking for a good final fantasy game to start up with I recomend Final Fantasy I & II Dawn of Souls for the GameBoy Advance , or Final Fantasy Origins for the PSone.Written by : ShadowMage ( The game maniac )	-1
Very , very , very obsolete , ffiv ( ii ) aged very poorly , remakes improves over original 10-100-1000 timesMy gripes for this version are:1 ) graphics are awful , more then a snes game , this looks as a nes game.2 ) easy version for the us audience , is too damn easy3 ) no dush button , the game is terrible slow4 ) very bad and censored script5 ) Where 's the ATB gauge ? without gauge , the ATB is pointless6 ) conversion is terrible ! Cut everything ! Cut magics , cut skills , censored text , cut out difficulty , this is tolerable ? My gripes for this game itself1 ) music is annoying , 20 seconds MIDI endlessly repeated2 ) short game , less then 20 hours3 ) The plot has absolutely zero depth or detail4 ) primitive gameplay , no job system , no esper system , no materia system , nothing of nothing5 ) don ' t even choose party members , the story choose your party ( most strategic game ever eh ? ) 6 ) the game world is too generic , no information at all . The game has 8 countries , but , you do not know anything about them.7 ) no description of items8 ) in the equipment shops , you do n't see the changes of statistics9 ) too large party so little time , characters do n't receive a true development besides kain or cecil10 ) Rosa is the worst feminine character ever , zero depht , zero background , I do n't know any information about her , besides she 's the white mage of the castle and love Cecil11 ) Cecil start evil ? Do n't make me laugh ! ! ! ! In the very first scene it 's already a good guy ! 12 ) dungeons are boring ! Cave , cave , cave , cave , mountain , cave , cave , cave ... .Graphics 1/10sound 5/10story 3/10characters development 5/10gameplay 4/10fun factor 3/10Whit this UNBIASED review of ff2 ( 4 ) I 'm trying to help the new rpg gamers often deceived from nostalgic o fanboy reviewers.My advertise ? If you want so badly play final fantasy 4 try the psp version ( the best version ) is 100 % improvement over this , or try the ds version if you like cartonish and blocking graphics.Stay away from the terrible gba version , loaded with bugs , bad control , bad sound and low difficult.Psx version is basically uncensored japanese hard-type snes version with a couple of fmv and the dash button , decent version but really no any real improvement .	-1
This has got to be one of the most boring mario games I ever played as a child . First of all theres no action no challenges which the bad guys ca n't kill you , All your doing is just playing as luigi pointlessly running all around the world searching for pointless clues of history to find mario and that 's absolutely no fun at all , Your better off going back to school studying world history than to play this game no less.If you want an epic mario game for your SNES look no further than SUPER MARIO RPG LEGEND OF THE SEVEN STARS instead , But yeah avoid this sorry excuse for entertainment.Overall 0/5 stars from me !	-1
This game is about as exciting as going to the library to read UA history books . Literally that is all you do , find items , find their place in history , fill in your history book and that 's it . Plus hours of walking around looking for turtles which ca n't hurt you . The bosses or enemies in this `` game '' can not hurt you ... .where the hell is the fun in that ? ! ? ! ? ! ? This is easily the worst game ever , even worse than the NES version .	-1
This game is dum . All you do is go around looking for Mario.There 's no action , no fun , no nothing . I ca n't beleive people bought this boring , pointless , and funless waste of money .	-1
Mario is Missing is the worst Mario game on the face of Earth.Nintendo should n't have given Software Toolworks the Mario license.Mario is Missing is a horrible crummy educational game that is n't really educational .	-1
I remember this game being fun . I recently bought it and its very confusing and a hard game to beat . Its fun at first , but then they add a stupid hang gliding test that just sucks . The game is tough and if you 're into a challenge where you have to go though rings for points and land successfully this is it for you . You have to use differentiate speeds and elevations for certain levels . I would have to say this game is similar to Star Fox but I do n't remember Star Fox being hard to play .	-1
This game is one of those titles that you either love or hate , and while its more loved than hated , I 'm going to say that I do n't like this very much . Now , I know that multiple people have wrote the same type of review here , but this game frustrated me so much that I felt that I needed to chime in as well , along with the two others who wrote a similar review to mine.On one note , I actually loved the color and diverse environments in this game , but there are two major flaws . The menu is extremely excruciatingly difficult to navigate through , you have to keep pressing X and Y all over again to find what you need , and the battle system is simply unforgiving . You have to wait for your attack to charge and sometimes you do n't have time to wait for your attack to charge , and you end up getting gang beaten by all the monsters around you because your sword does not even hit the monster half the time , ( yes you heard me right ! ! ) half the time ! ! ! That is unacceptable especially for an action RPG.For a turn-based RPG I may understand , but even on turn-based RPGs enemy evades rarely happen , and only happen when the character has an agility lowering spell cast on , but no in Secret of Mana , you have to miss the enemy more than 50 % of the time trying to hit it and it really aggravates me ! ! There is one more thing about this game that is an absolute deal-breaker . When you try to exit a room , you have to forcefully gather your characters by either hitting select , or going back towards them , but what if an enemy is still in the way , well you character meets the reaper ! ! This is the epitome of poor game design , I absolutely can not fathom that this game has even passed testing , let alone getting the Nintendo Seal of Quality back in its release in 1993 , and being re-released on Virtual Console without the AI problems addressed ! Thank goodness I only wasted $ 8 on this game , and not $ 60 on a SNES cart . Please play Breath of Fire II , or Chrono Trigger instead , or if you really want an action RPG , you can play Illusion of Gaia or Zelda : Link to the Past ; you will thank me later ! !	-1
A friend at work recommended this game to me , he being an RPG enthusiast just like me was surprised when I said I had not played it . I 've beaten Legend Of Mana , so hey why not give this a go ! Honest opinion ... . Not as great as I expected . I did enjoy it to some extent , but about 8 hours in it just gets cheap . I 'm talking Ruby Weapons `` Quicksand '' attack cheap . Enemies start multiplying , bosses start coming in pairs and heal each other/Revive . I 've come across this before in RPG 's ( Star Ocean 3 , Legend Of Dragoon , Paper Mario ) , but in Secret Of Mana it 's way out of control . I guess that 's how they chose to make this game difficult , just give enemies doppleganger/infinite healing/infinite revive . Not my style . It 's not like me to just up and quit a game right in the middle , so I 'm a little disappointed . As for this being one of the greatest RPG 's Ever ? I would n't go that far and I would n't bring it up in a conversation concerning that subject . Also it 's absolutely not worth that $ 50.00 `` used '' price tag it holds . Maybe it 's on PSN ? ahem , on a much brighter note . May I recommend some highly acclaimed games like Legend Of Zelda : A Link To The Past , Final Fantasy 3 aka 6 , or Chrono Trigger instead ? Anywho , if you 're a fan of this game no disrespect . This is just an opinion , do n't get all hurt . Quiet frankly I thought `` Legend Of Mana '' was an ok game . Have n't tried Dawn Of Mana , but was told to stay far far away from it .	-1
I heard SO many good things and how legendary this game was , I bought it , and Wanted a refund.The framerate is SO BAD that its like watching a slideshow . Virtua racer on the genesis is SO much better then this.and the controls ... .. HOHOHOHOYou go way too fast , and the controls are SO SLUGGISH.I played at least 45 minutes and trained , but I couldnt do good enough , I keep crashing . IDK Y nintendo thought there console was so cutting edge that they tried to make it do 3D polygons , but it fails . leave that up to the PS1 and Sega Saturn .	-1
Sunset Riders is just like any of the TMNT ( Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtls ) games except this one has cowboys and it 's set in the old wild wild west.You play as 4 different sherriffs ( Bob , Billy , Steve ? and Cormano ) and your objective is to take down the most evil and dangerous men in the wild wild west.O.k . this is what makes this game stupid , the enemy to hero ratio is completely off . There are always a lot more enemies than heroes on the screen for the most part and that makes this easy game a little confusing and a little too challenging seeing as how if you get hit like once or twice , you die and when a screen full of bad guys shoots 8 bullets in all different directions , it 's kind of hard to didge.Turtles in Time is a much better 2 player game but if you 're looking for a slight change of pace , here 's your chance with this cowboy shoot em up .	-1
this game is so boring , do n't get confused this is nothing like the other kirby games . It 's in the style of tetris . and it gives tetris a bad name . This was a disapointment.If you liked this game check out all of the other kirby games	-1
This is not a kirby game . It is another puzzle game like tetris but not as fun . It is exactly like a game i have on my computer called `` candy crisis '' ... . But kirby charecters unstead of candy falling down . What u do is match the objects up and try not to over flow the placement . It gives u two different objects at once and u make sure u match the things falling up to what is on the ground which u can move them over or turn them in different directions to match them . I like the original kirby on the nes so i tried this one and its just a puzzle game . I like all of the other kirby games better because they have a story .	-1
this game is terrible , the graphics are bad , the controls are worse , you cant tell what you can hit and what can hit you ... it looks like a bad nes game . its just not worth your time . i only game it two stars bc i do love wolverine and i had expected so much more from this game ... why do video game companies always put out bad games for superheros ... it makes no sense . only get this game if youre just a huge fan of wolverine and dont care how bad the game is ... otherwise i suggest buying the xmen game for the snes ... u can be wolverine and its much more fun and the graphics are great . try that one instead	-1
the snes version is way too hard to finish the sega genesis version is alot better & easier to finish	-1
WOW ! ! ! It 's Wolverine in his very own video game ! ! Let 's all celebrate ! ! Let 's throw a ^* & % ing party ! ! Seriously though , even if the controls were n't disgusting , the mere fact that it has one of the world 's most over-rated comic book super heroes would destroy it ... for me , anyway . Some people actually worship this guy . You can probably find some geek with a shrine and a poster that says , `` Wolverine , our savior , is better than God ! '' . Wolverine used to be my favorite until over-exposure such as this ruined him . Now I 'm rooting for Storm , who is infinitely ( times 2,000,000 ) better than Wolverine will ever be . What about the game , though ? I 'd give you one if I could , but I was n't able to play the game long enough without getting bored out of my mind .	-1
I played the first few hours of this game in utter agony . Do n't get me wrong , it started out promising : the music is AMAZINGLY atmospheric ( it gave me the creeps ! ) , and the game definitely has originality going for it ... . But ... . Yeah ... . That 's about it ! Earthbound is just so ... slow ! And boring . The humor is n't very well done , either , I might add . It 's juvenile and blah ( it 's obvious that it 's intentional , but they could have been more creative , I think ) . The battles are painfully slow and the enemies are far too strong . I found myself having to level my character up ( Ness ) within the first few steps out the front door . Not only are the enemies too powerful , but to heal , you have to fight to power up your magic stats high enough to survive your way to the next plot point ... . Is n't this game supposed to be a comedy ? Why the insane difficulty ? It makes no sense to me , here.Anyway , I 'm not going to rant on forever . I 'm only giving my honest opinions . Which are few , being I abandoned hope so early for this game . It 's definitely not worth the asking price ; go for the Wii Store route instead . Why spend so much on something so mediocre , unless it 's for nostalgia 's sake ? And that 's where I will end this review , in saying that it is OBNOXIOUS to even imply that this game is the `` Best RPG Evarrrr , '' because it 's far from the truth . Panzer Dragoon Saga might be the only RPG worth shelling out this sort of cash for . Not Earthbound !	-1
the cable rattled when i first recieved it and didnt work so i cant really give a good review m	-1
decent attempt at a knock off , but its bootleg as hell . they should be selling these with crack so you can get something worth the money being spent .	-1
I got this when i dug my snes out and started playing it . But when i wanted to play super mario world on multiplayer i could not find the second controller . I looked everywhere . Anyway when i bought this one it looked great . But it was not . When u start to use it u notice that the cord is way shorter than the original controller , it is not even the same as the other because it does not say snes on it it just says nintindo but that does not really matter , and the worst of all the buttons stick and they r really stiff and hard to use . So now when u play multiplayer u r not even close to as good as u r with the original . Save ur money and buy the original one .	-1
I have never played a good Addams family guy even though I have tried over 5 of there games . avoid this one . 1 star .	-1
Complicated Storyline - there is often a limited sense of direction.Although your objectives/directions are usually handed from an NPC in a town , a castle or a cave , you may still find yourself having to keep a pen and paper handy so you wo n't forget where to go.Item Confusion - the magical properties of certain items aren'talways clear , such as the : Charm Top , the Amulet and the Magic Seal.Repetitive Nature - the battles with enemies seem extemely repetitive at times ; enemies always re-spawn when you walk off the screen . If you come back into a room , you 'll be fighting them again . In case you think there was something you missed at a castle , all your enemies are back to greet you.Untimely Deaths - if there 's enough powerful enemies on the screen , there 's also the risk that your party will get killed off before you cast a single spell . Even though Chrono Trigger utilizes the beautiful Secret of Mana graphics engine - 'Mana ' was not only an easier plot to follow but it also did n't have a turn-based battle dynamic like Chrono Trigger . With Chrono , you ca n't even evade enemies if they 're directly in your path . You 'll be rolling through every single enemy in the game unless you run away during the battles.Poor Shopping Dynamic - Nearly all the shops in game sell the same stuff . The shop in Medina has cool stuff but the goods are hideously expensive . By the time you have enough coins , the items in your inventory are likely already better.Enemies in the game never drop anything but gold , experience points and replenishment to your HP/MP . All your gear is coming out of a treasure chest in some dungeon.Poor Characterization - all your playable characters are one-dimensional and have very feeble personalities ; by this I mean there 's very little feeling , emotion or even romantic involvement between characters save for something shallow between Marle and Crono . Compare this to Final Fantasy 3 which despite also having turn-based battles , FF3 had a better soundtrack , storyline , items and graphics . FF3 is also a year older and was made by the same folks at Square.Only in graphics is Chrono Trigger more relevant to Secret of Evermore ; however , the boy and his dog still had more depth and character than any single character within Chrono Trigger.BOTTOM LINE - Chrono Trigger 's replay value does n't come from the multiple endings the game has to offer or the handful of choices you can make to encounter those endings . Replay value is associated with forgetting how bad this game is and in trying to overlook all its many drawbacks . The terrible cover art on the box should 've been the first warning .	-1
why is this game so expensive ? ? ? ! ! ! It was by far the worst megaman game ( along with x5 and x6 ) . And i beat them all might i add . But x3 had nothing new . The only two things new is u can play as zero . BUT if u die with him , he is gone for the rest of the game . And there are 8 capsules . But 4 are the normal armor and the other 4 are extras . But u can only get one extra . Megaman x1 is alot better and so is x4 . Get those two and u are set .	-1
Lufia 2 rise the sinistral is the epitome of the mediocrity , no matter what 's the legion of fanboy snes rpg tell you . It 's avarage.The puzzle-oriented dungeon design is the strong point of the game.The positive- great use of puzzles in the dungeons- capsule- always escape- no casual encounters ( only world map ) - dungeons are fun ! - good extra- love storyThe negative- terrible storyline , simple and cliched plot , really a disappointment- stereotyped characters- the game do n't aged very well- the gameplay is a bit monotonous- ugly and repetitive graphics ( it 's a 1996 game and secret of mana , release in 1993 has much better graphics ! ! ) - mediocre soundtrack- poor presentation- easy near the endgraphics 5/10soundtrack 7/10story 4/10characters 4/10gameplay 9/10fun factor 9/10Miscellaneouslenght : a 40 hours gamedifficulty : easy near the end , but despite this is goodreplay value : avarage , good amount of extra	-1
Street Fighter II was a crappy fighting game that was completley unplayable.The gameplay is awful and the cartoon graphics just made it even worse.Mortal Kombat had it ALL OVER Street Fighter II in ALL of these areas.Mortal Kombat really shines in the graphics compared to this heap of crap.Playing as realistic digitized characters was just so much better than playing with animated cartoonie looking dorks like Ryu or Ken.Pass this up and get Mortal Kombat instead.I know Mortal Kombat 1 for SNES did not have the blood and gore , but it was and STILL is better than this.Bottom line is ... ALL Street Fighter games suck and Mortal Kombat is better in EVERY WAY ... MK ALL THE WAY !	-1
Levels are way to small and game play is n't very exciting . Characters wont think for themselves at all and if one gets killed you lose ; So much for the red shirts ! I 'm not even sure it was worth the $ 10 I paid for it .	-1
Away Team could have been much better . It did n't seem to stand out from all the other simulator type games out there . I was expecting more , but I was a little dissapointed.The graphics are mediorcre and the sound and instruction a little confusing as you play . A little predictable too . I guess I was a little disappointed based on all the other simulator type games I have already.You be the judge .	-1
Firstly , in common with Activision 's previous Star Trek title , Elite Force , this is far too short for a full price game . The plot 's none too poor , and has some pleasant twists that suprise , but the gameplay is repetitive and limited , so that by the end it has ceased to be a joy and more like a test of stamina . Of major concern is the lack of an equiping screen and though you do get to choose the team that goes out , each mission 's requirements pretty much pick the squad for you anyway . Couple this with the fact that you have to micro-manage your team 's every move ( they wo n't even shoot back when shot at , just cry out ) and there 's no multiplayer option except co-operative over a LAN , means that this is one isometric squad-based shooter to be avoided . If you like this style of game you could do worse than buying Fallout Tactics instead , or save yourself [ the money ] and pick up a copy of Abomination - The Nemesis Project .	-1
What a shame . Great idea , great concept , but so poorly delivered . This is not a patch on Commandos 2 and it lacks everything that made Commandos 2 so good . The characters are dull and the games leads you rather then allowing you to direct the flow of the game.Commandos 2 took me best part of a month and I enjoyed every minute of it , as a Trek fan I looked forward to this one but I finished it easily in two days and was sadly bored for most of it . Avoid .	-1
Now when I first played this game , I loved it ! But after awhile of playing I came to this one boss that I have spent a month on and hav n't been able to beat ! And it 's not cause I 'm not good at fighting , it 's because whenever he hurt 's you , his life bar refuals to whatever amount he hurt you for TIMES TWO ! ! ! So if he takes away 22 health points from you , then he will gain 44 health points from you ! ! ! What ! ? ! And because I ca n't get any more health than 96 it makes it so I 'm at a MAJOR dissadvantage ! And for the record 7/10 that I attack him I miss , even with the special attacks ( Every one knows that special attacks should n't miss . Other wise that makes it a regular move that just costs something more than a special attack ! ) ! ? ! Now that 's unfair . Now I 'm not saying the game is bad because I was really enjoying this game up to this point ! But now I feel forced to buy a hint book or I may never beat this guy . Shame on the creators for making such an unfair boss ! I feel like I was robbed of my money for this game .	-1
How anyone can give this title a solid 5stars is beyond me . This title is by far the worst RPG game ever created ! ! ! `` Time Stalkers '' is everything gone wrong with an RPG , which had the potential of being a great title , if just a little more time and effort were put into the project . Dungeons are randomly picked , ( which can be an either good or bad thing dependings on one 's preference ) can only carry 5 items when entering a dungeon ( only level 1 weapons can be carried inside a dungeon since your character is started at level even time they enter a new ) , and worst of all if you 're defeated in a battle guess what , not only do have to start the entire dungeon from scratch , but you 're also started back at level 1 and lose all of strong weapons which you had gathered during your voyage ! ! What were the creaters thinking ? ! ! Not only that , but the list goes on and on ! ! Do not buy this title ! ! I 'll make you want to play NES rpg titles ! ! ! Which are better may I add , than this title ! !	-1
From what I read about Metropolis Street Racer I expected a solid racing game with speed but got neither . The game favors no contact driving instead of fun ... uh I mean speed . Imagine a racing gamme with no speed ... who on earth could think of such a dumb concept its like a Sonic game without speed or a Doom type game without gunsReally a sad disapointment . The graphics are okay but the game play SUCKS ! ! Avoid this like SARS	-1
horrible graphics , bad controls , annoying guy in your ear saying & quot ; no tangos in site & quot ; It took me about 30 minutes to beat on the hard difficulty level . I bought it back when it cost 70 bucks , plus i thought i had to buy a control pack to save a game . You dont need to save a game , because if you cant beat it in one sitting you shouldnt be play video games . Go out and buy a ps2 and play some real games ( n64 is dead )	-1
I am a professional gamer and this is the hardest game i have ever played , not only that , but there is rarely any action to it , so dont let the beginning fool you , this game is worth it if you are professional , i beat it , but not very many people have , ... the worst buy i have ever bought , so dont get it unless it 's cheap	-1
RPGs are my favorite genre . Especially action ones , which are few and far between . I was hoping this would be another & quot ; Zelda & quot ; or & quot ; Alundra & quot ; with better graphics . But it was simply annoying . I cringed the first time I heard Musashi 's HORRID voice , and every other time I heard it . Big disappointment . The game was promoted as an RPG , but it does n't remind me of an RPG . It 's an annoying adventure game with annoying voice acting . The & quot ; hero & quot ; looks and sounds like a bratty ten year old . Definitely not for everyone , especially someone expecting a typical RPG . Do n't disappoint yourself like I did . This is the first time I ever returned a game , in the same night to boot ! Rent it first !	-1
Busido Blade 2 is as original as fighting games get . One strike one kill style Asain sword fighting . As for how that translates to game play though , give me a boreing old overhead life bar anyday . The rounds in Busido Blade 2 last seconds . It is near imposible to block a sword strike ! In the origional you could at least defend yourself a bit making it a much better game . So only play this if you are the most die hard fighting fan . I will take Tekken 3 , or Street Fighter Alpha 3 over this every day and twice on Sunday !	-1
This game is fairly primitive , both in gameplay and in graphics . It 's a straight-up fighting game that pretends to have a story and a purpose -- but basically you go from fight to fight , and that 's about it . I hardly ever play fighting games , or any games really , and I finished the game with one character in about a half hour . Supposedly they expect you to play through with every character , but hearing each character 's voice or slightly different way of fighting is hardly a reward . Compared to a game like Virtua Fighter 2 , this game pales , and I 'm sure there are lots more martial arts games out there that are more worth your time .	-1
I was reading through some of the glowing reviews for this and I still ca n't believe that no one has called this game for what it is , a Turkey ! The fighting system is garbage . The graphics where ugly . The play controls are so awful it makes me wispful for Pit Fighter . There are cameos from Final Fantasy 7 that you can unlock , if thats your thing . If you are like most people who enjoy a good fighting game for what it is , I promise you will not be too moved by this novelty . You may care even less if you hated Final Fantasy 7 , like myself . I would compare this fighting game license title to LucasArts Star Wars : Masters of Ter & auml ; s K & auml ; si . If you are a fan boy who gobbles up everything Square pooped out in the last 20 years and called it candy , then this is for you . You probably did n't read my review and already purchased this game along with a Tifa body Pillow . I would like to close with the inescapable truth that Capcom can make good RPG 's but Square can not make good fighting games , deal with it !	-1
This is basically a chicks game , with toned down action , and horror themes designed to appeal to girls fears , most guys wo n't like it . More basically it 's a failed experiment in game design . They had an interesting problem here with figuring out how to blend two contradictory game models : rpg vs survival horror , or leveling vs running away ... But it does n't work . The only thing interesting to me , in concept not execution , are the battle and weapon upgrade systems . The battle system mixes real time evasion with rpg atb , the problems are : enemies too fast , mostly undodgeable area attacks , slow character and enemies cast a slow spell to make you slower , and there 's no room to move in the field . The weapon system has it 's own problem with annoying penalties , and inconveniences . There are serious problems with pacing and story development , cutscenes vs playtime , and level design . The writers think that techno babble is story when it 's just a plot device . The are parts in the game when you 'll watch/read 15 minutes of cutscene , go do something boring that takes 5 minutes ( like pressing against a box tapping x trying to get it to open ) and then watch/read 20 minutes of cutscenes . The difficulty of the game is annoying , it 's mostly designed to move you along like a movie but then will drop in cheap insta kill attacks . A lot of the rooms are empty except for graphic decoration , there is no dramatic action , plot element , or puzzle to solve , and exist only to hold a key to the room next door . Monsters infinitely respawn at doorways , and there 's no way to pass but to fight them again . The monster design ranges from silly and lame like random placement of arms and legs , down to embarrassing like the final boss , who has a giant peepee for a tail , and a n-t sack hanging off his -ss . For most of the game you 'll hear the same two song : overworld arpeggio , and battle theme . Camera angles suck . I could go on critisizing but it 's tedious . This game is obsolete and only of interest for game design students .	-1
I got this game expecting a lot . I was very disappointed . But first the good . The game is innovative , being a departure from the standard RPG by Squaresoft . The battle system was a good attempt , but did n't work too well . The cinematic features of the game were not disappointing . The cut scenes were wonderful and the overall graphics were pretty good . The storyline was interesting as well.Unfortunately , that did not make up for the confusing nature of the game . The weapon modification system did not work well , and as I said before , the battle system did not end up being as good as it could have been . The gameplay was not immensely fun either.Call it my opinion , but I did not enjoy this game at all and could n't wait to trade it in .	-1
It 's a little late to be writing a review on such an old game , but hey this was my first play through and thought a review might help someone make a decision on whether or not to play Parasite Eve . Now a lot of reviews do a great job of summing up the flaws of this game , bad running system , very short game , super linear , etc . Here 's my ultimate beef with Parasite Eve . It fails to be a worthy RPG and lacks cunning elements to be a decent horror game . I ordered French Toast with hot maple syrup and sausage on the side and what do I get ? A dry lukewarm bowl of oatmeal and no milk . BleH ! My Other Beefs With Parasite Eve 's : -Cut scenes before boss battles . Anyone who likes RPG 's knows how utterly frustrating it can be having to watch the same cinematic before a hard boss fight.-Bad weapon system . Why use a rocket launcher when you can upgrade a pistol to do just as much damage as well as make you act faster in battle ? Whoever was assigned to work on this part of the game was in my opinion lazy.-Two discs only 14 hours of gameplay . What ? ? Already mentioned in other posts too.-Linear , Linear , LinEAR ! ! ! Ok not Final Fantasy 13 Linear , but close to it.-Boring story . Think of a corny Scifi movie and there you have it . Nothing new or exciting . If anything the story borrows on Resident Evil and tries to mix in it 's own thing . Whatever that is because I totally missed it . Same old , same old.-Adding techno music to a game is n't a great idea if you 're going for horror . It 's catchy , but destroys the mood when you 're in a dark hall and there 's creepy ambient noise . Then all of a sudden Pu-ch Pu-ch Pu-ch , *surrounded my monster.-Sad last boss battle . It 's a fairly easy win , but here 's the catch . After the battle you have to run from the creature through a ship . Think Resident Evil 6 Ada story , but if you take a wrong turn and it catches you guess what ? Game over start over from last save point . Only your last save point was before the 10 minute cut scene before the boss and the 10 minute boss fight . So after all the failed attempts just to run from the boss you 're looking at a 3 hour last boss battle due to failing to run away from it. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Now Parasite Eve does have good graphics for its time and a very nice soundtrack with some catchy tunes . Is this enough to make it a great game ? In this case no ... Ahem ... check please . It 's just lacking way too much to be worth while as many others have already mentioned here on Amazon and does n't really pull out anything unique.Also on a side note if you 're a Christian I highly recommend skipping this one as it manages to drop the name `` Jesus '' twice in the first five minutes of game play . Then four minutes later you find a journal that mentions the bad guy wanting to `` sell their soul to the devil . '' Mix that in with a bunch of `` Hells '' and `` God '' throughout the whole game.I bring this up because I 've played a lot of RPG 's in my time . I mean A LOT . And it 's very uncommon for stuff like this to be said in a Fantasy game , especially on this level . Poor choice of dialogue , the guy who translated this to English should have been fired . I 'm sure you wont find this type of dialogue in the original Japanese translation.It 's games like Parasite Eve that make me ask `` Why . '' Why do n't I have millions of dollars to make a game to show them how it 's done . That would be great , but I do n't . So I 'm stuck just throwing in my two cents on how and how not to make a game . *sighAnywho , all is not lost . If you 're looking for a classic RPG that 's worth while why not check out -Vagrant Story- or -Threads Of Fate- . A few months back I played -Vagrant Story- and it was actually pretty decent . Solid story and gameplay . Very similar to Parasite Eve minus all the bad stuff.Thanks for reading , hope this helps .	-1
To anyone who is trying to play this game today , I just want to say that I played this under optimal conditions ( Christmas break , 1998 ) at the height of my PS1 gaming power ... and this game was extremely , extraordinarly mediocre . I know that a lot of people are falling over themselves to play the sequel , but you have to ask yourself , if a sausage factory like Square has waited over 10 years to make a sequel to one of their most ( at the time ) expensive franchises ... was it really all that great ? The game had a few good perks to it ( customizable weapons , beautiful CG cutscenes , a pretty unique storyline for an RPG at the time ) , but if you play it without the rose colored glasses of nostalgia and collectibility , you will find an utterly mediocre gaming experience . I beat the game from start to finish , and at the end of it I could only say `` I spent 30 hours of my life on this ? ! ? `` I gave it 2 stars mostly because it was a risk on Square 's part to break away from the successful Final Fantasy/sci-fi settings , which is commendable in itself , and I had approximately 2-3 hours of enjoyment out of it , but if you 're seriously looking to spend $ 180 on this game , it 's not worth it !	-1
Over the years I played Road Rash and had many happy memories with it ... actually it was n't this game , it was Road Rash 64 . This game is a disaster , and a blight to the Road Rash franchise . To start off , the combat mechanics really do n't work and feel and haphazard . Unlike Road Rash 64 , which has smooth and tight combat mechanics and controls , this game does n't do just about everything right with the controls . It has a stupid driving mechanic ; you use the second analog stick to drive while using R1 to attack . WHAT THE F*** ? ! WHAT 'S SO HARD ABOUT USING THE X BUTTON TO DRIVE ? ! Next , is the crashing . When you get knocked off your motorcycle you have to run back to get your bike . With Road Rash 64 you get put back on your bike automatically , as with this game you have to find your bike and get back on it . The graphics are better looking than Road Rash 64 's and the character models are n't recycled , but this game is incredibly flawed and not fun ( especially when a car randomly appears in front of you and you get hit ) . This game is so disatisfactory that I 'm going to change my Road Rash 64 review and give it a higher rating . Avoid this game retro fans , you will hate yourself for playing it .	-1
I own Saga Frontier one and it is n't as bad this is . Why ca n't these SaGa Frontier games be good ? I thought that this game would be different . No longer competely non-linear gameplay . There is a story that is very evident how who are supposed to follow it . Not like Saga Frontier where you could wander around for three hours and still not know what you wher doing . The battle system reminded me of old Game Boy games . You can only use this weapon 50 times and the attacks are incredibly weak quick whack the enemy again . I 'm sorry but I am a firm believer that weapons should n't have a fixed usage to them . I believe that they should break on a rare occasion but they should n't have fixed number of times to use . The story goes between two characters that you choose which one to follow . At least they took a better stab at making a better story for the characters than they did last time . The battle system is also very complex . There are three types and sometimes it really confuses the player as to the differences between the three ( and there are differences ) . The game 's music has never been a strong point . I did n't care for it at all . Some of it was really good the rest sounded really bad . The graphics are beautiful though . They look very similar to those in Legend of Mana ( same artists I think ) and they will bowl you over . If you like graphics and do n't care about anything else with a game enjoy . Otherwise do n't waste your money .	-1
This must be better as a PC game . Now I see why it was so cheap . The controls and maneuvering are so ridiculously difficult to learn and master . And the game has no tutorial or any way to learn what all the little squares and whatnot mean . I spent over an hour trying to figure it out on my own and could n't so I put it down and never picked it back up . I hear the one for the PC is a real classic and very enjoyable though !	-1
good idea bad try.nobody well come to ur town.none simciy games r playable	-1
this game is boring and all you do is build very boring buildings with no detail ... you take 3 hours to build a city that is not even detail enough to see people or cars or anything going on ! ...	-1
From what people make this game out to be , it was supposed to be the & quot ; best game of all time & quot ; perhaps , but I saw it completely different . I dunno if it is just me , but I found this games storyline incredibly boring , the battle system was OK in some areas , and the music was absolutely dreadful . Let me break it down for you ... .Music : 1/5 ... Why ? Because it repeats the same tunes over ... and over ... and OVER AGAIN . The reason I gave it one star , is because when you first hear the music it sounds good , but after hearing it in so many areas throughout the game , its tedious and very annoying . And when it comes down to it I was n't very satisfied with the music to begin with . Like for example , most of the areas in the game will play the same exact music , so it gets very repetitive.Storyline : 2/5I found the storyline pretty horrific as far as being interesting and captivating . Not once in the game did I really care about the characters or what was really going on . And there is so much talking in this game I could probably fall asleep after drinking 10 glasses of cafe mocha ... To be blunt ... there is way too much talking ... and the story isnt explained till the end . So throughout the whole game you are confused about what the heck is going on.Entertainment- 3/5Why am i giving it a decent score for entertainment ? Well there are a lot of interesting mini games here and playing in the xenogears mixed with humans is also interesting.Playability- 4/5This is probably the only good part about this game . You can actually jump around here ( unlike most RPGs ) and there is plenty to explore in your environment . This sometimes makes traveling through long boring dungeons ... not so dull.Graphics- 3.5/5The graphics are alright , not good enough to give four stars , but pretty good for when it came out . I am a sucker for 3d playstation one style graphics ... kinda the old-school style that playstation RPGs used to have . If you are looking for final fantasy 8 graphics ... .you wont find them here.Overall- 2.5/5If you have a lot of time on your hands ... or like playing games for extended periods of time ... this is for you.I however , do not enjoy playing games for 80 hours just to see the ending . Yes thats right ... 80 + hours just to finish it off , not including finishing everything such as side quests ... just the storyline . How someone can sit through 80 hours of jabbering and a boring storyline ... and let 's not forget annoying music ... I have no idea . I hope some day I will understand why this game is considered to be so great ... but I do n't think it will happen.Do i recommend this ? Nope .	-1
I loved the Sim Theme Park game on PC , and when my brother got a PS1 for his birthday I went right out and bought the Sim Theme Park for Playstation1 . Well , I was dissapointed . The graphics have been reduced greatly . It is also difficult to create a park ( in my opinion ) , and the it takes a while for our version to load . However , there may be a scratch or so on it , since I did get it used ( I am cheap lol ) . However , most Playstation 1 games have lower graphics so , it is n't that bad . But honestly , I like the PC version much better than the PS1 version.Pros:1 ) Fun creating your own theme park2 ) The great PC game comes to PS1 ! Cons:1 ) PC version better2 ) Low graphics3 ) Controls are difficult	-1
I think Nintendo 64 was probably the worst Nintendo system next to the standard NES.The standard NES had a strong library of games but that didnt matter because only 3 or 4 have a save option . Nintendo 64 on the other hand has strong graphics and a short amount of games . There are only 4 or 5 games on this system that are worth owning unlike Game Cube 's 15 . The graphics are not a weakness what is a weakness is that Nintendo 64 just didnt have enough quality games.Super Mario 64 , Super Smash Bros , F Zero X , Ms Pacman Maze Madness are the only N64 games worth owning . Those games almost make up for the limited number of games.Its still worth owning because of its great games but dont get your hopes up after all these years there have been only about 4 or 5 games worth owning.The Super NES also had a pretty limited supply of games but managed to be one of the best systems ever made because the 5 or so games for it were masterpieces.I suggest you get a Game Cube because it has more worthwhile games than any other Nintendo system before it .	-1
It is a known fact that the N64 got its barn doors blown off in the system wars . Upstart Sony took the technology that was to be the foundation of the SNES CD-ROM add-on , and proceeded to give the world the Sony Playstation , and they 've been on top of the biz ever since . The N64 was crippled by Nintendo 's stale conservative business attitudes , a lack of games aimed at anyone over the age of 10 , and an expensive cartridge medium that required inflated prices to recoup any sort of profit from.And that is where we stand today : Nintendo 's current contender , Gamecube , is being smacked around by both Sony ( PS2 ) and Microsoft ( XBox ) and as if that is n't enough humiliation , Nintendo still wants consumers to shell out 100 bones for what amounts to a 1995 model automobile.Are there good games to be played on the N64 ? Of course . It 's just ludicrous to expect the game-buying public to pay the equivalent of Gamecube prices for an outdated , dead , way-past-the-prime-it-never-had system . It 's a shame , because there are some fine titles to be had , but no one will buy them when they can simply sink those funds into a state-of-the-art machine.Dumb marketing , thy name is Nintendo .	-1
I found this game more aggravating than enjoyable , and was constantly reloading maps to try and place my units in a more strategic area ... which I was n't very successful at . When my units did have LOS enough to & quot ; fire & quot ; they spent most of the time yelling about & quot ; no clear shot & quot ; . Meanwhile , the Americans can do little to nothing to stop the German tanks , while in reality a well placed round from a Sherman , AT gun or even a bazooka could at least immobilize a german tank . The computer controlled german tanks have 100 % comprehension of the terrain and even the layout of units they should n't be able to see , firing all the way across the map . The computer controlled mortar crews can knock out every half track and armored car you own , while in reality they should n't even be able to see them yet , while your mortar crews are useless most of the time . The player controlled units are slow , their turrets are usually traversing the wrong direction and they are always & quot ; aiming & quot ; and rarely firing . A target can come around the corner , its turret already rotating and knock out a sherman before you can even make its turret line up to fire . Very , very annoying when American armor is in such short supply ... but it lacks punch anyway . Watching the historical accounts of tank battles , 5 shermans in real life could knock out even a tiger ... in this game they can only draw fire to themselves while not doing a bit of damage to the enemy ... ca n't I at least immobilize a panzer once in a while ... throw me a bone here . However the infantry units are great , fighting a hopeless battle until the panzers show up to blow 'em to hell.I found CC3 to be more forgiving to sunday gamers , with the russian T34 's and tank destroyers being an even match for panzers . I would love to see an AT rifle score at least one hit on a tank though ... some day maybe .	-1
This game is boring because it 's all the same . If you get a different pokemon , it doesnt matter . you do the same thing over and over . You attack and beat and attack and beat . It 's too easy too . I thought Pokemon Snap was MUCH better ! That game was one of my favorites . This game just has no point . Fighting is the only thing you do . I mean the gameboy pokemon was better than this one ! You get to go on an adventure and find things and get items ! That was fun . This is fighting ONLY . Boring ! If you want a good pokemon game get any of them for gameboy including Yellow , Blue , Red , Gold , Silver . Or even better , get pokemon snap !	-1
Well , I ca n't say that Nintendo made false promises ... the game gives you your Pokemon in all their 3D glory , with their cute little attacks in 64 bit graphic splendor.What else , you ask ? Well , that 's the problem . There is n't anything else . This game is fun if you and your friend want to play Pokemon with better graphics . There is almost nothing else to do with this game : although it offers multiple other features , none of these merits any praise.For example , the game comes with 9 & quot ; mini games & quot ; of sorts ... which are all basically variations of each other in that they all require mindless button mashing . Some require TIMED button mashing ... woo hoo . The only one that speaks to be something worth anyone 's time is the Clefairy memory game , which requires you to remember sequences of arrows and repeat them within a time limit . These games get real old , real fast . But that 's why its worth RENTING , not buying . Blockbuster will even give you the nifty little controller pack to upload your pokemon should you so desire. & quot ; But it comes with other stuff too , you biased punk ! & quot ; It does ? Oh yeah , that silly single player thing where you can fight against a bunch of ridiculously easy trainers to ... earn nothing . No exp , cool items , secret endings , or anything interesting like that . Why bother when you could be kicking the living crud out of the elite four again and again for experience ? The one redeeming thing about this game is the single player one-on-one vs computer mode . You choose 6 pokemon - all level 50 - and your opponent does the same . These pokemon all have attacks pre-assigned to them - and higher evolutions are n't necessarily better , because the lower evolutions have superior attacks ( so that everyone isnt choosing charizard over cute lil ol charmander ) . In essence , the only way to win is pure strategy , because you ca n't go out and level your pokemon a bajillion levels and try to use brute force.But then again , the primary audience of Pokemon is little kids . And since when do little kids use strategy in these games ? Excuse me while I go knock on wood.Again , to summarize , its a renter , not a buyer . It 'll keep you entertained for a night or two , and is GREAT for pokemon trainer parties , but beyond that , the game is a waste of everyone 's money .	-1
The only reason this got two stars were the mini games which are n't near the quality of Mario Party games or pretty much anything else . What this game is is the annoying random battles from RPGs without the fun magic systems , plotlines , or general gameplay . Transfer pak adds nothing to the replay value and will be worthless on the n64 , avoid .	-1
Is it me or is this game really boring , repetitive commentary , pointless competitions , no advancement for beginners to masters , and even the `` fun '' little party games are quick and boring . There are several parts to the game , the challenge road where you go through six Pokemon categories each getting more difficult . There is the freestyle where you battle against other Pokemasters or your friends . There are even nine party games which get old very fast . You are supposed to use your own Pokemon from your Gameboy pack , but there is a way to cheat by using the rental Pokemon which comes with all 150 Pokemon ( instead of having to earn them ) . Even children get bored quickly of the game . There is a good part to the Pokemon Stadium package , it comes with a piece of hardware that lets you play your Gameboy on the N64 . This also is not a RPG like the Pokemon Gameboy games are .	-1
I may not be a Pokemon fan anymore , but I LOVED the series when I was a lot younger ( Fun Fact : A Jirachi card was what motivated me to ride my bike ) . Actually , I 'd probably go play Pokemon Sapphire again if I were to come back to Pokemon fandom . Now , let me tell you : I 'm not one to troll Nintendo . I 'm a HUGE Nintendo fanboy , just so you know ( See lots of my other reviews for proof ) .But then when you look at Pokemon Stadium , you 'd probably think : `` OMG POKEMON ON NINTENDO 64 ! ! ! '' It would be one of the best Nintendo games ever , considering how awesome the series was on Game Boy , right ? WRONG.Pokemon Stadium is n't what you 'd expect to be the next big entry in the franchise . Rather than it being an RPG , the series 's turn-based battles replace it all ! It 's all about fighting your Pokemon . Nothing else . In turned-based battles . How the heck is that supposed to work ? It 's not . If it 's an RPG with that stuff , then we 'd be all over it . You CA N'T have the turn-based battles make up a whole game by itself.Okay , maybe it actually is n't ALL about the turn-based battles . There are minigames , and some of them can be rather interesting . But they only remind you that this should have been an RPG . We had to wait for Pokemon Colosseum to give us the experience that we really needed . This should be left alone , as one of Nintendo 's few pieces of crap . At least the graphics were amazing for the N64 .	-1
A game where you play as a trainer and command Pok & eacute ; mon to fight other trainers , sounds awesome right ? Pok & eacute ; mon Stadium is possibly one of the worst Nintendo games I have ever played . Now , when I was a kid it was really fun to do the free for all mode and chose the best Pok & eacute ; mon the game had to offer , but after you played that a few times it was time to shut off the Nintendo and plug in another game . There is no main story to keep you involved , its only tournaments after tournaments . In retrospect , the idea of a Pok & eacute ; mon battle game sounds amazing , but if you thought it was going to be anything like the hit Pok & eacute ; mon games on the Gameboy your surely mistaken . The one thing this game had going for itself was its stunning graphics . Pok & eacute ; mon Stadium used the Nintendo 64 to its full use on detail in this game , but the soundboard on the game can get slightly tedious and annoying . With an announcer restating every move you just made over the loudspeaker , it makes you want to play the game with the sounds off , and if your going to play it with the sound off you might as well not play it at all.Overall I give this game a 2 out of 5 . It has great graphics , but the game could n't seem to pinpoint the certain aspects of a Pok & eacute ; mon game that its players love ; the story and the adventure side .	-1
At first Mario Party 2 seems like one of the best games . Do n't get tricked . After a while , Mario Party 2 , will be the most boring thing ever . The minigames will get old and it just wo n't be fun . The multiplayer mode is good for partys but even then will get lame . This is a rental only .	-1
The controls in this game are confusing , because you ca n't tell what the messages or options mean . However , if you want to play this kind of game , I recommend reading the instruction manual daily . Why ? Because the rules are completely forgettable . Otherwise , this game may not be worth playing , unless you have a partner to help you play it .	-1
the transfer pak only works on a limited number of games and u wont use it a lot unless u have pokemon stadium or perfect dark.if u have those games and hvae game boy versions of them , buy this . If u dont theres not a real reason to buy this if u dont own those games .	-1
This pak is basically only for the Pokemon Stadium game , which is quite fun for me , since I love the strategy of Pokemon . Anyway , I got this and did not know that Pokemon Gold did not work with Pokemon Stadium ( 1 ) and I also discovered that you can not mix and match Pokemon . For example , load one pokemon into the game and then rent pokemon of that type . Maybe I am not very experienced with this , or did not read up on the product more . However , if you can get it for a low price it is interesting . But , it has n't worked for me since I lost my Pokemon Red game ... Pros:1 ) You can add more pokemon that you can not rent2 ) You can play the gameboy version3 ) It is a low price ( especially when you get it used ) Cons:1 ) Not enough games that work for it2 ) Simply , not really much point	-1
If you have a Gameshark , get this game . I thought it would be easy , but now I need a Gameshark . I named my Pikachu Rocky and it only says & quot ; Pika & quot ; on Stadium . If you 're good at Stadium , you could get this game too . Get if you can beat Red and Blue without cheating . That is what Yellow is like without a GameShark . I ca n't even pass Celadon City because Pikachu is so scared .	-1
This is the so called & quot ; Better version & quot ; of pokemon blue and Red . The only thing that 's better is that you can get Charmander , Squitle , and bulbasaur . the graphics chanmged a little bit and Pikachu is the only pokemon that cries it 's name ! ! ! Why is that ? But Pikachu learns new atyttacks like : Dulble team at Lv.15 . It raises your Envade . Slam at Lv 20 . A normal phsical attack . and Thunderbolt at Lv.26 . Pikachu is your starting pokemon . But It ca n't evovle . Raichu like kicks ass . Raichu has one attack Pikachu does n't , Mega Punch . for people that do n't know this but sometimes you nmeed to make some of your pokemon to elvove to mlearn new moves .	-1
There are good zombie games and there are bad zombie games and i hate to say this but this game has to go under bad zombie games.The gameplay itself is fun but when was it invented that zombies could shoot machine guns ? Also the plot is not so good who wants to chase after a young man who does not want to show his face to until the very end.My last gripe about this game is the graphics are aful for a system that is supposed to have very good graphics.The reason i even rated this two stars is one it gets a star for booting up and two for having some creativity but not much creativity at all though do not get me wrong .	-1
Once you play the first scene , all others are the same . You have the same type of customers and the same moves within the cities . I got bored after 30 minutes of play . The only highlight of the game were the soundtrack from hit bands , The Offsprings and Bad Religion . One of the bad games Sega had made .	-1
Pick people up and drive them through an impressively rendered city to a limited number of destinations . Along the way you can chase people off the sidewalk , bang into cars , dodge traffic and even drive across the bottom of the ocean , but so what ? You ca n't shift except to put it in forward and reverse . The car acts as though the wheels were under the center . There 's no power sliding around corners . People always get out of the way on time . Some of the roll overs look realistic , but there 's no real damage . You almost never get up to speed as there are so many obstacles and sharp turns . The cars all handle about the same.This is the kind of feel good game . It all takes place on a bright summer day . The convertible taxi 's go bombing around with their tops down , but I get a little stressed with all the rush rush and the traffic . I just do n't feel like this is that much fun . It 's stressful and tedious . People say this is a racing game , but it really is n't . It 's a driving game , sort of a fake driving game and I think it 's best suited for an arcade where the glitzy graphics can pull people in for a couple of rides and then let them get on with their lives . Playing it for more than a few minutes just shows you how little it has to offer . I do n't think they even have different views and I 'm sick of this town , San Francisco.If you want a decent racing game , get Need for Speed for PSX or even Ridge Racer . At least RR had powerslides.Oh yeah . The music sucks and the chatter gets old even faster than the game .	-1
D2 has it 's moments but for the most part this game is just plain boring . The graphics are stellar , the cinematics were well done and the controls are pretty easy to learn , but when it comes to actual gameplay , there is a lack there of . The game consists of four discs of little more then repetive cgi movies . You control a women who never speeks on camera but supposidly does off . You are forced to trek back and forth to the same spots over and over again killing the same monsters in the same spots the same way each time . 90 % of the time you will have no control of what is going on and just sit back and watch . And for every little thing your character does , open doors , pick up an item and so on , you are forced to watch a quick cut scene , Everytime . It gets very old very fast . For those who actualy like to play games rather then look over your friends shoulder and watch , look elsewhere . Do n't even bother with this coaster .	-1
This is not a game it is a completely computer rendered movie with good Dialogue decent story and wonderful music . The problem is I play video games to play and this title lacks gameplay in a woeful manner . You switch modes so there is some upclose gun battles alot of em in fact thats all the gameplay really consists of besides wandering around . The hunting mode is fun for about ten minutes until you master it . I would buy this game for under twenty bucks and be happy with the entertainment value I got from the FMV 's and the soundtrack both of which are incredible . If you are looking for a scary little movie that you push along you might just like it but rent first .	-1
I definitely do n't care for nonlinear games . I may go back and try to solve this one again some day , but for now , I prefer games with puzzles and progress . I did a lot of dying the few attempts I made at the Last Express .	-1
Traveling on the Orient Express amidst intrigue may be perfect ingredients for an adventure game , but in the case of `` The Last Express '' the souffl & eacute ; still collapsed . Starting with the unorganized activities that are required of your character , plus a dash of the bizarre , `` The Last Express '' is a messy , depressing game . This , combined with some hopelessly outdated graphics , make this game one that I would n't recommend.The game is mostly in first person , yet you do see the main character in the third person . Unfortunately , the creators of `` The Last Express '' decided not to use real actors in the game like `` Myst '' and `` Titanic : Adventure out of Time '' did . They instead digitalized the characters , a mistake in a time before the technology was there to make semi-realistic-looking computer animated people . The result is that the characters in `` The Last Express '' look like cartoons.Another fact to take into consideration about this game is the `` real time '' aspect . Instead of events being exclusively triggered by another , the character sometimes is required to `` wait '' until a certain amount of time has passed for the next part of the game . This was not much of a problem , except in one part of the game where you must wait to get to the next station.By themselves , the cartoon-style of the characters , plus the `` real time '' aspects of the game , are n't a big problem . A big problem with the game is in regards to the plot . It 's confusing and what the character is supposed to be accomplishing is not explicitly explained . Ever . The game takes place before World War I , and involves international intrigue , with sinister Communists and Germans . Eventually , you can glean information , but basically you are dumped on a villain-infested train with no clear goals . However , that 's just the beginning . The plot , which is rather an unorganized one , also takes on some bizarre twists . First , the game includes a strange dream sequence , which gives the game with a strange atmosphere . The ending of the game also includes an incredibly unrealistic and bizarre sequence . SPOILERS FOLLOW ! ! ! ! The main character also falls in love with a woman on the train , whose life he saves at least once . At the end of the game , she leaves him at the station , handing over her dog to him for safe keeping . The game closes with the dog barking mournfully . It was a depressing ending to a strange game . END OF SPOILERS ! ! ! ! Also be warmed that there is violence in this game-literal throat slitting , gunplay and hand-to-hand combat-although he character animation makes the blood look very fake . Still , if you do n't like this kind of thing , avoid this game.My recommendation is not to play this game . The plot is uncoordinated with a depressing ending , and the outdated graphics do n't help at all . If you like the spy/espionage thing , tryTitanic : Adventure out of Timewhich has an excellent plot and takes place around the same time . And if the Orient Express interests you , tryAgatha Christie : Murder on the Orient Expressinstead of this game .	-1
This game [ stinks ] . ... Buy it if you want to occupy yourself for 1-2 days . It 's basically doing the same thing over , trying to achieve new goals that each mission sets . Not much of an RPG , juz plain strategy with a medival theme .	-1
The game is a typical real time strategy/tactics . It combines elements from familiar Microprose games ( e.g . Masters of Magic ) with real time components . The major drawback of the game is that there 's really not much to do - the game kind of plays itself . You only contribute by building buildings and telling them to produce units . The mechanism for controlling the units is kind of awkward , even if somewhat different than other games . You set a price on a territory to explore or a bad guy to kill and the units respond based on their character . There 's no way to give specific commands to units . The game gets old really fast , the variations in strategy from one scenario to the next are negligible . It 's interesting at first but gets boring very quickly . In addition the scenarios are kind of easy . I gave it up after the first two hours . I think you can find tons of better RT strategy games . I am a huge fan of the Microprose titles and this was a big time dissapointment .	-1
In my book , [ this ] is a major investment for any & quot ; game & quot ; , so when you plunk down that much green , you 'd better end up green with envy that you were n't the one responsible for designing such an amazing product . In the case of Gunship ! you 'll see plenty of green but only in the form of the aircraft , the ground , the trees ( did I mention the ground ? ) and loads of lifeless buildings stacked together like some survivalist compound . The excitement in Gunship ! hardly went further than the slick graphics and screen shots on the box . As for performance , the play of this title is just plain ... plain , sort of like Cream of Wheat if you do n't cook it with a pinch of salt , all the sugar in the world wont help , and it does n't help Gunship ! So to avoid that familiar dull sinking feeling you get in your gut and your wallet because you 've been lured once again into the cold murky depths by the Sirens Song ( i.e . slick packaging ) , wait until it goes on sale or you can get it in your local second-time around software store for [ less ] ...	-1
I was really desprite to get this game because I wanted ahelicopter Gunship game . I had Commanche Gold but that was good for beginers . I wanted something more advanced . I bought this.Here is my two cents . This game was terrible . DO NOT LISTEN TO ANYONE SAYING IT IS GOOD . If you really want a good Attack helicopter game get & quot ; Eenemy Engaged : RAH-66 Commanche vs. Ka-52 Hokum B : Aligator & quot ; Long name but good game . Now back to Gunship . As everyone said the waypoont system just plain does n't work , you have to go through a whole menu system and it only worked for me during the demo . The CP/G is a usless jerk who never does anything you say . And if you play as the CP/G the pilot always gets you killed . Firing a missile at the target YOU want is nearly impossible and for [ the price ] this is just a real rip off.So in a summary all I can say is do n't buy this buy somethiung else ...	-1
Like I have said before when I reviewed Tiberium Sun , Westwood provided a excellent battle interface and look . Now I just want Westwood to give a game with a good storyline . In Tiberium Sun , it was horrible how they gave James Earl Jones and Michael Biehn such a ... bad storyline to act to.Now in Firestorm , we have to relive all the nonsense again . Why did I buy this add-on ? First of all I got it for dirt cheap and I wanted to see what the new units had to offer . Firestorm is truly the worst add-on pack that Westwood has ever made . At least the orginal CC add-on pack had the dinosaur levels . Why anyone would want to play the same storyline twice is beyond me . The AI is truly stupid . On the GDI side , just amass a large group of Orca bombers and you can obliterate anything , and on NOD side , you can pretty much Sub APC engineers and steal all your enemy 's buildings and easily defeat them . I finished the add-on in one day . The add-on is that pathetic.The Add-on is centered on one thing , DESTROY CABAL . Now , I happen to think that CABAL is pretty kewl , especially when you are working with him . But now you have to destroy him twice in both campaigns . One of the new units , the Reaper , you do not get to build or create which is pretty much useless . And in the last mission on NOD campaign , CABAL attacks you with both NOD and GDI units . The computer always has to cheat does n't it ? The game play is still unbalanced and you can whiz thru most missions like a breeze.I do n't recommend this unless you are really bored and want to play thru 9 missions on both sides that follow the same storyline . I truly hope Red Alert 2 will be a improvement . I really do n't think anything can top the storyline in the orginal Command and Conquer .	-1
Like many of the other previous reviewers , I bought the game because the demo was outstanding . I 'm finding in practice that the game really does n't measure up , however.To Ground Control 's credit , this is probably the best 3D land-based RTS game to come out yet . However , it still does n't manage to escape from a lot of the shortcomings of its fellow 3D RTS's.The nature of 3D RTS , at least so far , seems to be that units are more 'realistically ' proportional to the terrain . While that may be nice on paper , in gameplay what it translates to is that you spend hours moving your units from one place on the map to the other , because they 're so small in proportion to the terrain . In fighting battles , you 're obligated to zoom out to such an extent that each unit is only a blip of a few pixels on your screen -- not much fun to watch or look at while directing the troops.I do n't find the elimination of resource management to be a plus for Ground Control . What that ends up meaning is that there is no reinforcement available for you to build or buy ; you ca n't simply play and have fun if you want to try different things in a mission . You have to carefully and tediously position your units so as to incur as few losses as possible . Add to this the fact that there is NO in-game saving in Ground Control , and you find yourself playing very carefully and tediously indeed.Topping this off , there just is n't a good story happening here to keep you interested . It 's mostly told through the thoughts of the two side commanders rather than through good character and dialog . The cutscenes are hands-down the worst I 've ever seen -- they are videos of the game engine , it looks like , and they 're so badly compressed that they look like they 're being streamed over the web -- blocky , blurry , and awful to watch.On the positive side , the game does look great , especially when you zoom in close to the units fighting . It plays better on lower-end systems than other games of its type , but you 'll still need a blistering machine if you want to see it in its full glory.Be warned also that it 's not entirely stable . A patch was released the day after it hit retail , but not all of the bugs are out of it . One of the worst is that it will crash on completion of a mission , and you do n't get credited with the mission . I 've spent more hours replaying because of this than I 'd care to admit.As a former Army officer , I think there are some cool tactical things happening in Ground Control that have n't been modeled well in other games -- friendly fire , fire support , formations -- but in the end , when all is said and done , I have to say that the game just is n't that much fun to play.You 're getting 90 % of the experience in the demo . If it really floats your boat after seeing it , then maybe you should try it . Other than that , buyer beware .	-1
I loved Fallout 3 and mostly enjoyed Fallout : New Vegas , so I decided to give one of the older games a try and was pretty let down . The main problem with the game is that it 's very unresponsive . Things occur so slowly that you cant be sure whether or not the game has even registered that you did an action or not.If you 're dying to play this game and are willing to put in the time it takes to deal with the finicky controls then you may enjoy yourself , but those looking for a quick fallout fix should just check out fallout 's great wiki .	-1
DOA2 is a fun game to play with friends that can play it also.First off the game has NO extras . That in itself is disappointing ! Secondly , the single player game [ ... ] BIG time . As a result the team battles and versus battles with friends are all you will have to hang on to.These 2 flaws really killed the game for me . I love extras and a good single player mode since I ca n't have friends over everyday.On the plus side , the graphics are great and the gameplay is fun , espically with friends . I 'll recommend this game as a good game to play with friends . If you do n't have that option then you couls let it slip by .	-1
After playing DOA Ultimate for Xbox , people may be tempted to buy this version for Dreamcast . Do n't bother , this version for Dreamcast is extremely boring . It has zero replay value . This game is garbage compared to the better Xbox versions.Other Dreamcast games that are 100 times better : Virtua Fighter 3 , Soul Calibur , and Project Justice . These 3 games are excellent and are only available on Dreamcast .	-1
Just when you thought it was safe to put off Baldurs Gate , here comes Icewind Dale . A magnificent combination of BG and the older games in the gold box series . Dungeon hacking and roleplaying at their best.In Icewind Dale , you form an entire party of your Player Characters , compared other BG engine games in which you were allowed one main player . This makes it more fun , allowing you to watch your adventurers progress one at a time as they grow so much more powerful than they were when the game began.Another added bonus is the addition of new spells and monsters . The enemy AI is stronger , and the new monsters such as mind flayers will provide enough fun and frustration to make this game a challenge for any level player.Look out Diablo 2 , Icewind Dale is a major contender to knock you off the number one spot ! One error for Diable 2 and its gone , because Icewind Dale is perfect .	-1
Fails . I 've never played baldurs gate . I remember my sister asking to so I asked my dad to play Icewind Dale . He set this up for me and I remember playing to the Vale of Shadows . I stopped about half way through . The most ignorant part about the games is the battles . As you go they get increasingly frequent . I hate haveing to fight a skeleton with 2 hp every other second . As for fighting , the game lacks as it is more of a point and click.I started playing again from the middle of the Vale , and finally got out of there . I then went to a temple which was alright . After that I realized that I was going to another dungeon type cave . This time , I read a strategy guide to find out that it was about 5 levels of fighting . That 's not fun . That is not fun at all . I could respect a short game with few battles , but when I fight battles every other minute just to drag out something ... It almost seems meaningless after a while.Anyways , I stopped playing there and decided to remake my party earlier today . I am enjoying it more , mostly because I know to make really powerful fighters and forget about druids . My druid last game killed about 15 units . My main character killed about 300 . This can only tell you that my druid was bad . Fortunately I was able to change him later in the game . Although when I did , I got stuck with a level 1 character who was easily killed off . So yea , do n't think because you can change your party means you will be changing later in the game . The feature is useless because by the time you discover just how bad your fighter is , the game will be too hard for you to change.The game does a great job in voice actors though . The fact that I create my entire party is fine . The graphics could use some work . I get tired and bored of the same old dark environments every other minute . Even the snow seems depressing . Other than that , the game offers repetitive battles and little more . Online play is n't fun at all considering on gamespy there are usually one or 2 games going . Once you do get in the game you will learn that everyone exported characters who fought enemies on easy and had the option & quot ; max hp on level up & quot ; set.Here 's some advice , go play baldurs gate . My sis , sister is playing it again . She is enjoying it . This game is bland , depressing , and repetitive . Sorry but do n't get it unless you wan na blow 5 bucks .	-1
... . It 's ... frustrating , too the point that it is n't fun . I 'm an avid gamer . It 's fun to `` role-play '' low level characters . An orc or two can be a very scary thing . This does n't translate well to a computer game that wipes out an entire party in ten seconds even with the `` AI '' scripts on . The visuals are cool , but I wish I would have plunked my money down for something else . This game does not deliver . Boring linear plot and hack-n-die . Buy some dice , a figure and paper for a real roleplaying game .	-1
I would have liked to play this game but it would not cooperate . It kept crashing , crashing , crashing . I wish developers would finish a game before they release it .	-1
Lara looks like a stick insect and there are so many moves and controls it 's very confusing . Also , i did n't even know where to go and the enemies are stupid . Do not go out and buy this , either hire it first or do n't bother at all .	-1
this game is the worst . it has bad gameplay and bad graphics , so what ever you dodont buy this game .	-1
This game really is n't as good as WWF Smackdown ! 2 , but I think that it has 2 things in it that should of been carried over to the sequel . One , You can Re-name your finishing move so it sounds cooler , like if your name is Jack , You can do the Jackcold Stunner instead of Stonecold , the other , in this version you can see the move names as you do them , it was really helpful when I had a Backyard Wrestling Federation , it made choreographing the matches easier .	-1
THIS WAS THE FIRST OF THE SMACKDOWN GAMES . WHILE IT WAS VERY FUN TO PLAY WHEN IT WAS FIRST RELEASED , THIS GAME IS ALMOST UNPLAYABLE TODAY ! BEING THAT WE GOT MUCH FASTER GAMES LIKE SMACKDOWN ; SHUT YOUR MOUTH AND SMACKDOWN ; HERE COMES THE PAIN . THE GAMEPLAY IS ACTUALLY VERY SLOW [ WHICH IS SOMETHING I 'VE BEGAN NOTICING RECENTLY ] THE CONTROLS ARE N'T AS ADVANCED AS THE LATER GAMES ARE , AND YOU 'LL JUST BE WASTING MONEY BUYING THIS GAME WHEN YOU CAN GET ONE OF THE MORE RECENT SMACKDOWN GAMES . DO N'T PICK THIS ONE UP NOW . IT ALREADY SEEMS DATED AND POINTLESS NOW .	-1
This will also be my review for every subsequent SmackDown ! game . After WCW started to lose popularity , THQ started to do WWF-themed wrestling games . When it did , even beginning on the N64 , there were hints that they were turning what was a good system into complete crap . They finally succeded ( so to speak , if that was their actual intent ) when they started the SmackDown ! series . I have no problems with the graphics , the entrances , or the sound in this game . I have the biggest problem however with the gameplay and how the game controls.First off , they gave the game arcade style feel and controls . Big mistake . They also made it more like the actual show : you have to continually punch the guy before you can start doing grappling moves . I may be in the minority , but constantly punching a guy gets old fast . I want to be able to start throwing suplexes and hitting piledrivers right off the bat . Secondly , the game 's A.I . has gotten extremely intelligent . Too intelligent . The game can kick your ass unless you 're a great gamer , and I 'm just average , maybe a little below . Mainly because of the counter system . The game goes like this : punch , punch , punch , punch , grapple , move-counter move-counter move , etc . You 'll get countered excessively , and your counters wo n't work most of the time . Yes , it is a lot like the actual wrestling you watch on TV , but for a wrestling game to be fun in my opinion , it ca n't be realistic in terms of following how an actual wrestling match would go . I do n't want to spend over an hour or more in a match , 15-30 minutes is plenty , unless it 's a Royal Rumble-type match.THQ threw out the window the great grappling engine they had with the N64 games and has replaced it with this tripe . I honestly do n't understand what the fans see in this series of game . I guess if you like your matches in the game to follow how the matches on the show work , and you enjoy the actual wrestling to a be a chore and full of non-stop punching and countering , than this is the game for you . If you want an actual FUN wrestling game , then I suggest you stick with THQ 's WCW games on the N64 . At least then , they had the right idea .	-1
Well , where do I start ? We all know about the basics ... ... .the lack of tech support , the missing roleplaying element , and the incredible lag . But it is n't these things that make this game so horrid to play . One can wing it without tech support ... ... ..and I have on MANY occasions , out of necessity ... ... ..I can also wait out lag or just reconnect . I missed the & quot ; Quest & quot ; part of Everquest ... ..but still managed to get some enjoyment out of the graphics . Now ... ..here 's the REAL reason why you should n't get EverQuest . After around level 15 or so ( if you are a talented soloist ) , you are FORCED to group to gain levels . That 's right folks . You have NO choice in the matter . Guess what this means ? This means you have to group with 5 other vicious , backstabbing whining , complaining 13 year olds that have absolutely no respect and little if any regard for you . I 'd much rather put my trust in a rabid pit bull than trust the life of my character to a cleric who plays like a wizard.Enough said . You will probably buy this game ... ..and probably think back on this review and say & quot ; Well , he was right after all & quot ; . And I have only one thing to say to that ... ... ... I TOLD YOU SO .	-1
I tried playing this game , but right from the start , I knew I was in trouble . No matter what I changed in the video options or on my monitor , this game was just too dark . The first guy I talked to I could n't even see and the item he left me I could n't find because it was just too dark . This is the only game I have had this problem with . It could be an awesome game , but I will never know .	-1
Yes , I went out and bought this new TR installment , and I have to admit that it is n't that great . Although titled TR : The Lost Artifact , it is in fact the equivalent of TRIII Gold ; however , since this installment does n't include the original TRIII levels , Eidos has simply marketed this offering as an expansion pack to the TR series.The choice not to release TLA as part of the Gold series is a flaw , to be honest . New gamers who are perhaps unfamiliar with the TR series are forced to purchase BOTH TRIII and TLA . For gamers familiar with TR , there is ( as of yet ) no rebate offer available to owners of TRIII and rumors abound that the TLA levels will not be available for future free download ( such as with TR Gold ) . Put simply , Eidos 's marketing strategy for TLA is awful strange.All this would be moot , of course , if TLA was a blast to play . Sadly , however , it has the feel of leftover levels rather than new crucial levels . I had no problems completing this game . I was never once stumped by any of the puzzles . In truth , I finished the six levels in breathtaking time . I admit , however , that I did a pathetic job at finding all the secrets . So , possibly , I may have missed some treasured gameplaying nuggets . Secrets aside , though , the levels should still be fun , challenging , and involving . A classic TR level , with challenging puzzles , should take HOURS to complete . None of the levels in TLA took me more than a single hour.So , unless your a TR fanatic , I 'd stay away from this one . Or I 'd at least wait until the price dramatically drops .	-1
Might and Magic VIII was really a dissapointment when I first played it . It has the same game engine as its most recent prequil , but with some downsides . First you only get to create one character , your main character , and the rest of your party is filled up with characters you meet . Second , and lastly , the characters are ugly expecially the male knights . If your a diehard Might and Magic fan ( like me ) you should definitely buy it ( to add to your collection ) if not stay away from it . I do n't like to dis Might and Magic , but when a product stinks , it stinks .	-1
Having played M & amp ; M6 and M & amp ; M7 , I was really looking forward to this game . Unfortunately , once I started I lost interest pretty quickly . It is so similar to the earlier games that I felt I was just replaying one of the other titles.My biggest problem is that there have been few if any upgrades to the basic game engine since # 6 . Do n't get me wrong , I like the basic game engine . The world looks interesting and is easy to navigate . However , some of the problems that first bothered me in 6 have become even more annoying in the later titles . Namely : HOARDS OF UNINTELLIGENT MONSTERS : All monsters in the M & amp ; M universe behave in exactly the same way . Once they see you , they charge to attack . ( OK. A few will shoot at you from range , but the principle is still the same . ) No opponents use even rudimentary tactics . As a result , every fight feels the same . And there are A LOT of fights . There are so many damn monsters in this game that your finger will get sore from pressing the attack key , and the repetition gets pretty mind numbing . In particular , I got sick of the pirates on the first island . There 's a trigger zone that creates new ones every time you enter it . How many times do we really want to kill the same monster off ? MONSTERS DO N'T REACT TO EVENTS AROUND THEM : The game uses the tired D & amp ; D cliche of the dungeon crawl . That is , you go into the first room , kill everything there . Rest . Move on to next room . Repeat . Guards in other rooms do n't react to your presence until you attack them , even if that is months later . Frankly , I would be happier if the next game in the series used a system like the one in Fallout 2 , where all the guards in a complex react in a coordinated way to your presence once they realize that you are there . This forces you to use stealth , dialog skills , and to really think about who you attack and when.THE STORY IS STILL VERY LINEAR : Basically , you have a bunch of quests you have to do . You have no real choices in who you ally yourself with and who you attack . The world consists of people you talk to and people you kill , with no overlap between the two.THE NPC SYSTEM COULD BE VASTLY IMPROVED : You have no choice in how you handle NPC 's . You hear what they have to say , then do their quests for them . I would much rather see the game move towards an NPC systme like the one in Fallout 2 , which is really quite good . Your lead character 's INT determines how many things he can think of to say , and his oratory skill determines how well he can lie and manipulate people . And you always seem to have at least two or three different ways to approach any NPC.Overall , my big problem with this game is that there just is n't a lot of thinking involved , or much freedom of action for the player . You slog your way through endless fights against repetitive and brainless monsters , only to collect a reward and then do more of the same .	-1
I have long been a fan of this series and I jumped at thechance to get the next game . I knew before hand that the graphicswould not be the best around , but that was n't important . The problem was the game felt hollow . There was much less of a plot then any of the others in the series , and was overall disappointing . The gameplay is n't that bad , but I would n't recommend this game for any but the most stalwart fans of the series.Might and Magic 6 and 7 were great games in my opinion .	-1
This game could have been so much more . The hack and slash action is not even fun , it just get 's tedious and boring . I have to admit the graphic 's are spectacular , but that does not make this a great game . Rune contains lot 's of jumping from object to object , which will get boring after they first introduce it into the game . The game also had no depth whatsoever . I never just want to play it for fun , because I felt there almost is no fun in this game . In my opinion , if you are going to get a hack and slash action game GET BLADE OF DARKNESS .	-1
... should have been the title . Which is a shame , because the opening sequences were well done and promised a good , solid FPS/3PS with a unique feel , and it performed well and looked very good on my computer . I especially enjoyed the underwater sequences with floating bodies , a sunken ship , and nasty looking fish , but the game soon deteriorated into endless hacking and chopping of an army of large crab-like beasts through never-ending caverns , all the while on my knees . Combine this with a monosyllabic & quot ; hero & quot ; ... .no , wait . & quot ; Monosyllabic & quot ; implies some form of speech or communication . This Neanderthal does n't even grunt . Conan the Barbarian is a poet compared to this guy and I 'm supposed to care whether he lives or dies ? Either way , I did n't make it through the first level before I returned the game . Perhaps you will have more patience than I .	-1
A Little To Fast And A Little To Short , But This Game Comes With Expansion That Gives The Campaign More Missions That You Have To Unlock In Different Difficulties , which I find very useless .	-1
Challenging ? No , Impossible is more like it ! Just remember to download the cheat codes first before playing this game , you 'll need them.The graphics , sound and user interface are exceptional but those features are over-shadowed by the short amount of time players stay alive in the game . This is not really a serious gaming experience , its more of an exercise in futility . The only time you 'll last longer than an alka-seltzer tablet in a glass of water is when you play as the Predator and even then your life span is not that long . The alien ca n't heal and the marine is the ultimate victim . The game settings should not be & quot ; Easy & quot ; , & quot ; Medium & quot ; and & quot ; Hard & quot ; ; they should be changed to & quot ; Slow Suicide & quot ; , & quot ; Quick Death & quot ; and & quot ; Do n't Bother Fighting Back & quot ; .	-1
Alien Vs Predator is a first person shooter . AVP has a very poor AI and does not have much of a storyline , It is just a get from point A to point B by killing everything that comes in your way . You could play as three different charecters Alien , Predator and a Colonial Marine.ALIEN : The Alien levels compared to the others are very easy . It does not have any weapons besides it 's claws and tail , So to kill someone it needs to get very near the enemy , But a couple of attacks could kill the enemy . It moves really fast and can walk on walls or any surfaces . It can see clearly even in darkness . The alien gameplay is orginal and a initially a lot of fun but gets boring fast because the same thing happens in every level , No new weapons or new enemies.MARINE : The marine levels are very difficult and quite unplayable . He has a lot of weapons but is given only a few for the levels and sometimes after the level completion the weapons collected are taken away and is given only a few . Each level have a lot of monstors but you ca n't see them comming because the levels are very dark and you need to use the image intesifier to look ahead , It makes the dark areas green and the bright areas white , If you fire a weapon with the image intense on the screen becomes white and you cant see where the enemey is . One minuite you could be walking with full health and aurmor but before you know it zero health , zero aurmor and game over . The marine levels are very difficult even on the easy difficulty.PREDATOR : Compared to the marine the predator levels are very easy but not as easy as the alien . The predator moves very slowly and can become almost invisible , It has many weapons and can take a lot of damage . The predator has four types of visions to see in total darkness and it can also heal itself.Each of the three charecters have six levels each , If you complete a charecter you could unlock a few bonus missions , And the number of bonus missions that is unlocked depends on the difficulty you play . AVP Gold has a limited number of saves depending on the difficulty . I would recommend you to play on the hardest difficulty ( Director 's Cut ) , Though it would be very difficult it would unlock many bonus mission , I do n't think there is any difference between the difficulties besides the number of saves you are limited . AVP 's graphics are sound are ok , The special effects are very good . Compared to the other games it ran very smooth and it did not crash much either . Alien Vs Predator is a good game but only for very good gamers , It is the most hardest and the most frustrating game i have ever played .	-1
Sent back , did not work .	-1
this game kinda stinks.you go talk to this old dude who gives you these long drawn out battle plans.then you watch these long drawn out cut scenes.then you go into these map/worlds.when you get near an enemy , you fight.well , sort of.the computer does everything.theres a lot of complicated planning involved.theres no clear cut way to figure out anything.its a real pain in the hiney.whats more is i dont belive i even saw any ogres.of course im only on like level 2 since the game is totaly screwed.i bought it used and the guy before me only got that far too.no wonder i got this so cheap.this game will use up all of your extra brain space.if you thought out how to beat it.you wouldnt have the brain sense left to eat cheerios.someone would have to run you an iv.youd almost have to be like freakin fixated on its ended.its totaly freakin ridiculous.and then , as youre being slain by little people with sticks , even though youre sporting a dragon , you are helpless to defend yourself.it sucks .	-1
Tenchu2 itself is n't an utterly terrible game -- I know I 've put in a good 10 hours or more on it , but what 's frustrating is how there is so much promise and so much failure both in the same package . The feel of the game is that Activision rushed this one out the door , and throughout the game you 'll find bugs , glitches and all sorts of annoying problems that would lead one to believe that the game was n't even beta tested . Here 's my list of gripes : -The controls are worse than Tenchu 1 : Of course , Tenchu 1 is clunky but they are even worse here . A lot of would-be perfect kills will get ruined because what should have landed you right on top of your enemy has you rolling out in front of them or some other stupid stunt.-Ridiculous AI : Tenchu 1 did not have the best AI but it was far superior to this . I 've walked in front of guards and had them not see me . On the other hand , some guards are capable of seeing me through the back of their head . Also , guards quickly forget your presence and seem completely uninterested in pursuing you once you are out of sight . Yup , you can be one foot away from them but under water , and neither can they see through the water nor are they patient enough to wait even a minute to see if you 'll resurface ( nor wonder why a bamboo air-pipe is suddenly sticking out of the water . ) This is really a let down given that there were reports that the AI would be vastly improved , guards noting blood running along a stream or looking for fallen bodies ( blood does n't run down stream in the game anyway . ) Other guards can see you without even being present . This is a neat trick when your KI meter is in the teens or lower and you ca n't see anyone but they can see you.-Graphic interface or whatever you want to call it : Graphics are just plain sloppy -- my ninja is often teleported up four feet instead of actually having to climb or jump over fences anymore . In the same manner , when dragging bodies I 've been able to leave them hanging in mid air , as though supported by an invisible floor of glass.-Graphics in general : Sometimes the backgrounds go through objects ( IE you can see the sun and clouds THROUGH a wall of mountains . Also , sometimes you can see guards out of your perriphrial vision but not straight ahead.-Inconsistancy with stealth kills : Again , not only can guards see you out of the back of their head , but some - can not - be stealth killed . PERIOD . This was n't evident until playing Tatsumaru 's 'labor shortage ' level where certain guards could not be knocked unconscious even with 20 tries or so . Incidentally , this level seems nearly unbeatable and I think gives even more evidence that this was a rushed job . With 20 tries on this level , I could not beat it , and I ca n't say I really want to anymore.-Difficulty level : A good friend of mine nearly sold this within the first week until we dug up the cheat code . The game is nearly unplayable without the armor , but it is almost impossible to get a grand master , so you ca n't get the armor . This would be different if I could start looting guards for blow darts on level 1 , but even then , those are useless against bosses , and between the combination of worsened controls , bad camera angles and 'two hits and your dead ' boss damage , Activision has managed to take all the fun out of Tenchu and turned it into a tedious and frustrating derision of the first game.-Voice assignment : This is thefunniest glitch . Sometimes the voices of the guards are the wrong gender , and probably the glitch that had me laughing the hardest was when the shark started talking . C'mon folks ! The shark should not talk . Please test your game before releasing it.-Mission editor is a joke : Ok , this is n't really a glitch , but really , I ca n't even make roofs in this thing . The saving grace would have been being able to make an island full of cats or something , but all you get are boring people ( maybe you can make a bunch of godha 's samurai and evil samurai line up like some insane football game ? ) My overall take on this game is that while Activision certainly added a lot of new things to make Tenchu the 5/5 it should have been , they lost it where it really counted -- the outstanding game play that made Tenchu 1 . Sure , Tenchu 2 has a lot of improvements , but none of this makes up for the lack of AI , a soundtrack , good controls , and an environment that reacts in a realistic way instead of one that has so many bugs in it I never know how it will react.I sincerely hope Tenchu 3 will be the game this should have been . There are a lot of great ideas here , but they just seem so poorly executed that it makes one long for the game this should have been . It 's still somewhat enjoyable ( especially with the cheat codes ) , and its glitchyness is sometimes amusing , but all and all it is n't worth the $ 40 price tag -- maybe you should look around your local vendors ... my used copy will be showing up soon : )	-1
The seller was Galactics . I paid 5 bucks . It worked fine on my PC running Windows XP Home SP3.This is a space simulation game . The graphics are a bit dated . The controls are awkward ( lots of different keystrokes to remember for various actions/movement ) ... that made it tedious . The story is mediocre ... nothing new.I had high hopes based on all the positive reviews.I played and enjoyedFreelancer . This is not like Freelancer ; the graphics are better than Freelancer , but the game play and controls are not.For me , it 's not a keeper.Visit my Amazon Collections to see my 4-star and 5-star PC games : http : //www.amazon.com/gp/customers/A12LH2100CKQO/collections	-1
Mr. Cage ? I love your games , but this just sucked ! Oh why do they make me type so many words ...	-1
There is nothing to do in this game its very redundant.Its only fun for 30 or so minutes ... It is way too short also ... But it is very detailed , like when you swipe your sword on the wall the sword will bounce back and make a spark and most games just have the sword go through the wall ... The graphics are very good.The gameplay is ok , the guy swipes the sword fast as hell , the bosses are easy , or most of them are.I reccomend buying this game if you wont get tired of stuff and like a lot of bloodlust .	-1
This has to be the worst idea ever . Sonic used the Genesis console 's high-tech processor to run at amazing speeds . He would run through a loop-de-loop . He slid down water slides . He jumped so high that you could see Star Light Zone 's night sky . Can an 8-bit processor do that ? No . When Sonic runs in this , it gets really glitchy . My game got confused and shot Sonic to the end of the level . The controls are not as accurate as the Genesis game , they lag a little bit and have bad traction . The zones are built terribly . Green Hill Zone has had every signiture loop-de-loop removed . Bridge Zone was an awful auto-scrolling `` bridge '' that had a horrible collision system . Sonic jumps onto a scale and waits for the rock to fall on the other side , but it does not bounce him high enough to reach land . He ends up falling and dying . Sometimes the pieces on the bridge fall ( not a glitch ) , but the issue is that so many fall that the game starts to lag . Do not get this game.Game Gear games I recommend : Sonic BlastSonic Triple TroubleSonic DriftGenesis games I recommend : Sonic the HedgehogSonic the Hedgehog 2Sonic 3 and Knuckles	-1
This game was too easy , too stupide , not enough challange , shall I go on ? After so many good games for this creampuff he finally got into a bad game . Let 's hope this is only a fluke like for Sonic ( Who made a number of bad games after & quot ; Sonic & amp ; Knuckles & quot ; ) before we got & quot ; Sonic Adventure. & quot ;	-1
If you have played this game in the arcade or on a Dreamcast unit you know how fast and colorful a fighting game this one is . Truth is it is one of the best 2D figthers you can play.Here is the bad news though , if you own a Playstation and want this translation you will be disapointed when you play . First of all the lack of the tag feature really does kill this game . Without being able to tag in another teamate mid battle it takes away some of the games statagy . I think it also seems to move and load much slower on the playstation than in the Dreamcast . We just have to face it , this game is a next generation game on a five year old piece of hardware , and it just does not live up to its true potential . I love my plastation , but I have to advise all to pass on Marvel vs. Capcom for it . Play Street Fighter Alpha 3 instead if you insist on getting the best 2D fighting action you can out of your old Playstation box .	-1
I 'm a big time 2D fighting veteran and I can tell which fighter is worth playing all over and which is worth ditching . Marvel VS Capcom for the PlayStation is an example of one of those 2D fighters that needs to be ditched . But do n't get me wrong ! I actually liked the game ... on the Dreamcast and arcade . The PlayStation version of Marvel VS Capcom is just swarming with a whole lot of flaws . Trust me ! This is not arcade perfect ! Most of the times , arcade translations that go to the PlayStation come out imperfect like this one . The graphics are just horrible ! Sure the characters and stages look colorful , but if you pay attention to the framerates of the animations , you 'll notice that the characters do n't move smoothly or move faster . The audio , sounds great . Music tracks and sound effects are brilliant , but nothing special at all . And as for the gameplay , just horrible . And the lack of a tag feature ? Now this is really going overboard ! Just like in Marvel Super Heroes VS Street Fighter for the PlayStation , you have to call up your character to do a one-hit special move . If you want the tag feature , you 'll have use the cross over mode , but this feature does n't emulate the tag features on the superior arcade and Dreamcast versions . The controls could 've been slicker , but instead , it ended up choppy . It seems that the PlayStation controller was not meant for great games like this . All in all , the PSX version of Marvel VS Capcom is a big letdown . Choppy animation , choppy controls , lack of a tag feature , and long loading times during the beginning of each fight really makes this game look like a zero . If you want the real Marvel VS Capcom experience , I 'd say buy the Dreamcast version of Marvel VS Capcom or spare a few quarters or tokens to play the arcade version . The DC version of Marvel VS Capcom featured flawless animations , awesome graphics , hyper fast controls , no loading times , and a tag feature . Now that 's an arcade perfect translation of one of the best 2D arcade fighters of all time ! The DC version is definently worth the money and worth your time ! Please ! Whatever you do , avoid the PSX version ! This version of Marvel VS Capcom is a disgrace to Capcom 's ever expanding lineup of 2D fighters ! Not really something to use your money on !	-1
The dreamcast is the WAY better version to get as this one is too slow and too easy.The playstation port of this game is sadly inept , i am a PSX fan but this game does stand short to the over versions .	-1
# 1 - VISIBILITY . I had to screw with the brightness on my television just so I could see the opening screen right . Everything is in a million shades of green , and you 'll be constantly running into obstacles , trying to turn yourself around while an enemy slowly chips away at your health. # 2 - DIFFICULTY . On the easist setting , I still can only get three levels into the game . It 's not that I 'm a lousy gamer , it 's just that certain spots where there may be a concentration of plastic helicoptors , infantry , etc. , are next to impossible to get around . I let a friend who is an excellent gamer borrow it for a week , and he could n't get any farther than I did. # 3 - TWO-PLAYER MODE . Two-player modes are supposed to be fun . This one , well ... is n't . The levels are too big , and you 'll spend ten minutes hunting down your friend 's flag , and once one of you gets the other 's flag , it 's too easy to cross back over into your territory without getting caught.Please , I beg of you , do n't make this an impulse buy like I did ! Rent first , and even then you 'll probably feel like you 've wasted your money . ( 1.5 stars )	-1
Yes , to a highschool kid working at Mcdonald 's for five fifteen ( have to spell it out for amazon ) an hour 40 bucks was a lot ! Even though there was the internet it was still growing . You still could n't find a review for every game you were interested in buying . Sometimes it still came down to word of mouth or hoping there was an open copy you could play at funcoland . I however went by word of mouth . Sure , this is a great game try it you 'll like it . Like a sucker I put down my big 40 which was probably 3/4ths of my total paycheck . I smiled in joy as a road the bus home with my new found game . Yiiipppieeeeee ! I could n't wait ! I come home and pop this wonderful gem in . Of course this game is badass ! how can I go wrong look at that hardcore cover . A soldier that 's ready for war what more could you want ? Then the game starts and I begin to play it . The screen is dark too dark I ca n't see anything . I adjust the brightness on my television . I 'm a little green guy who shoots pellets or maybe bullets out his gun in a horrible looking world with horrible aiming and horrible controls that make the entire screen move awkwardly with each step . I think to myself this will get better this is probably just like this on the first stage . Then as I play I realize that it does n't change ... it never changes . It 's just green globe of pixels that shoots a horribly aimed weapon in a dimly lit world . How could this be ? How could what could have been a fun game be so crappy ? Even in PS1 days this game was unacceptable . That comes from a guy that plays PS1 games still in 2011 ! This game slowly crushed my gaming dreams and made me hate the name 3DO ! I cursed it and spat at it . I immediately went back to the story and tried to make an excuse to return the game . I told them it was defective and that the game was too dark to see ( actually that was more of the truth than anything else ) . I begged and pleaded with the manager but unfortunately she showed me a new copy of the game , opened it before my eyes ( smashing my hopes of returning it as new ) , and handed it to me . I looked down in my hands at a new copy of the same turd I just tried to flush . I took the game and walked out the store with my head hung low . A month later that toys store burned down . I smiled as I passed by . A feel of ease that no one would have to suffer anymore and knowing that numerous copies of Army Men world war had perished in that fire . Yes , I had one that war . I lost the battle when I returned it but I won in the end.P.S . I did n't start the fire .	-1
I bought X-Men : Mutant Academy as an X-Men fan . I wanted to like it , but it was just awful . The graphics suck , the sounds are cheap , and the whole game itself is all around cheesey . No way that this game is worth the money ; go buy some X-Men comics instead .	-1
This is the most boring game for game boy . All of the moves are kick , punch , rage . That is it . If you want a good game , i would agree . I would get street fighter alpha 2	-1
Not so much a game as a mild thumb workout , 'Mutant Academy ' looks nice ( it 's by the same people who did the excellent GBC version of 'Street Fighter Alpha ' ) but is much too easy . You can quite literally win every fight by holding down 'right ' and pressing the 'A ' button extremely quickly , and it 's surprising that the creators did n't spot this before they released the game . There are plenty of X-people to play as , and there 's a handy 'VS ' mode so that you can bore a friend , but unless you deliberately handicap yourself this is n't much of a game , which is a shame as there are n't many decent beat-em-ups on the GBC .	-1
Here is yet another poor X-Men game for the GBC courtesy of Activision , only this one is the worst . While the PS1 version of X-Men : Mutant Academy was n't half bad , this GBC conversion is downright terrible thanks to the clunky controls , insanely easy difficulty , bland backgrounds , and scratchy sound . While the player animations are colorful , they are quite jerky , and while the selection of fighters is nice , there is just something more to be desired . All in all , even if your the biggest X-Men fan , leave this game on the shelf , it 's terrible .	-1
I 'm a pretty good gamer , but sometimes there 's a few little hidden & quot ; extras & quot ; in a game worth checking out . GameShark lets you do it . If you 're patient . And have a lot of time . And do n't mind HOPING that your codes work after you swith the GS disc with the game . And do n't care that it does n't fit in port 1 , so many games it works for ca n't even use it . ... .	-1
i 'm going to guess these people make console games or wish they didThis game is 3rd person , a *really* bad choice for this game . The camera is often stuck behind thingsThis game is hard . That 's OK , but you ca n't save a game , and you *will* die thanks to some surprises , so expect to get bored playing the same thing over and overThere are only 11 maps i think , and most are _very_ small . The game is short , although they stretch out the game play by preventing you from saving the gameIt 's a minor complaint , but why do n't any of these Asian gangsters recognize a tall , white , albino , bald guy with a UPC code on his head ? Is his disguise of a shirt and pants really that good ? There are numerous bugs . Or maybe they are n't bugs , just bad design choices . For example , you ca n't walk through a guarded gate unless you first touch someone who has walked through it - bizareThis could have been a really good game , but it is n't .	-1
The initial thought of the game seems good enough : trying to break down the all-too-linear approach to first person shooters , and give the player alternative ways to finish off your objectivies . But this is exactly where the game fails . The missions are clearly designed for two specific approaches : ( 1 ) Blast your way through ( which is remarkably easy ) or follow a very fixed stealth route . The first level could be an example . Here you are supposed to assassin an important trial member . You can then either choose to shoot everything that moves , or get on top of a building an snipe the target . Those are basically your two options . And quite frankly , I had expected a much more open gameplay.The computer A.I . is also horribly bad . On one level , you can easily stand against a corner , shoot two guards that are in the room , and then wait for other guards to come running in and shoot them too ( all the time you hardly take a hit ) . Here 's another example : At one point you 're supposed to kill a trial leader . After having disguised yourself as a waiter , you attempt to give him a poisened bowl of soup . Unfortunately for the trial leader 's bodyguard , he has to taste the soup and ends up dying . There 's a cinematic gunfight where the leader escapes . Now here 's the thing : after the gunfight , everything returns to normal and all the trial guards in the resturaunt does n't seem to have noticed anything.The positive thing about the game are the graphics . The movement of the characters are fairly realistic . I especially like dragging corpses behind me and watch how their bodies bump into furniture and such . If you try dumping a body over a toilet , you 'll see how it slumps down the side and falls to rest on the floor . Very nice . The jungle levels are also impressive , with the trees and the plants.But as they say : gameplay above graphics , and here & quot ; Hitman & quot ; fails miserably .	-1
..Until I read Rob Matthews ' review of this game . I am also stuck on the training mission . I never got past it since I would go up the elevator , shoot a guard and then wind up at the beginning . This is a bug to end all bugs . It felt like I was in that Star Trek episode where they kept repeating the same day over and over again.I had high hopes for this game ...	-1
Looking at the box of this game i expected it to be really cool , and from reading all the reviews that say it was good , but when i bought it , it was a very large dissapointment . After the first few missions the game becomes so frustrating , that you will want to break your computer . The controls are very messed up , and the camera fews always get stuck on walls so you can not see anything . This game is frustrating because 90 % of the game is trial and error . If you go the wrong way you become ... , because most of the missions are timed ... so you lose the mission . I got to admit the visuals in this game are very eye pleasing , but it does n't not make this game worth the ... that it is . HC47 also had tons of glitches and bugs in its system which eventually ... the ... out of you . Well my opinion is not to buy this game , but u can try it for yourself , and see what you think	-1
Yes , this game is amazingly difficult , as the & quot ; Cons & quot ; say up above . The enemies do the same thing every time you play the level , so basically you just play the same level over and over to find out the scripting of that level so you can make an attempt to beat it . And quick , your hit might leave , so it 's timed . Also , it took me an hour to beat the tutorial , which is required . And , even worse , you ca n't save during levels which makes it frustrating . Barely over 10 small maps . Maybe a few more . Bad Game .	-1
I got this game cause my cousin gave it to me . The concept sounded awesome - like you 're this hitman going around doing missions and killing people . To be honest , I have not finished the game . The action is very slow paced . You have to plan things out . There 's no way you can finish a map the first try cause you have to know the pattern . For example , when the limo driver makes his routine routes , or when the bad guys go inside the shops , or when the bystanders are not looking , etc ... . At first it starts out really fun - like everyone has mentioned . But as I progressed in the game , the missions got a lot bigger , harder , and more complex . Even the maps get more bigger and it 's so big that it takes forever to get around . sometimes you have to do 6 sub-missions on one map , which can suck because if you screw up on the 4th sub-mission , for example , then you got ta start all over again . basically it 's a lot of trial and error . I 'm more into fast paced games like Half life and counter-strike and Unreal tournament and Delta Force so this was n't my type of game . I basically got bored of this game and it does get frustrating . Maybe it 'll be better with a cheat or whatever . But I 'm going back to playing counter-strike and Unreal Tournament . It 's time to pass this game to my other cousin .	-1
I had looked forward to this game for months . It installed without incident . The problem I had was the tutorial , beginning with the elevator ( lesson # 4 ) . The booklet says to & quot ; call elevator & quot ; . I did n't have to because the elevator was already there with its door open . Then the instructions are to click on the control panel and select & quot ; basement level 3 & quot ; . Clicking on the control panel did not work . What did work was to spin wildly inside the elevator clicking on the walls and everything else until it moved . Then I go to the very last Lesson ( 9 ) with the sniper rifle . I could not put it down and was unable to finish the tutorial , and as a result could not play the game . This game is loaded with bugs . Do n't take my word for it -- go to eidosinteractive.com and look at the forums for Hitman . I was n't the only one to have trouble in the elevator .	-1
After purchasing Deux Ex and falling in love with that game , I looked within the Eidos family to find another FPS with the same kind of action and functionality as Deus Ex , after reading many good reviews on Hitman I decided to give it a day in court . I just want to say that Hitman is a satisfying game in its own right , but when compared to Soldier of Fortune and Deus Ex it simply ca n't hold its water . So I urge you to give Deus Ex a try , and give Hitman a go only if you have a day to spare to fly through it .	-1
I got this game thinking it would be at the very least a little bit of fun since I had never played a motocross game before , but instead it was a pathetic disappointment . First off the graphics , while not terrible , are disappointing especially since this is a relatively new game , the bikes and riders are n't well detailed and the tracks are even worse . The sound on the other hand is horrific there is absolutely no music with the exception of the opening movie , and the sound effects are BAD , your bikes engine sounds weak and there is n't any background sound ( and another completely unexplainable problem , you engine sounds like it 's idling whenever your bike leaves the ground even if your gunning it ) . Another HUGE disappointment is that all the bikes handle exactly the same according to engine size , so a Honda 250cc and a Yamaha 250cc will handle identically ! There is no real tournament mode , there is something called pro-circit where you enter a set of races to earn money but there is NO way to upgrade your bike you ca n't even buy a new one , as you progress though more bikes will become availible but since there all in the same engine class there is no difference , and there is no choice as to wether or not to repair your bike , so once you choose your class your just racing to keep in the black . The manual claims that teams might let you join but I found no indication of that in the actual game . The AI is almost impossible to beat and if you do n't place dead last you can consider your self a great racer . The physics are contradictory because takeoffs are way overplayed but landings are almost impossible . Overall this is yet another game that could have the best of it 's genre , but because of Microsoft 's lack of attention to details it will be doomed to the bargain bin .	-1
Do n't get me wrong , this game is n't that bad , but there are quite a few things that I do n't like about it . For one , you can only do so much stunts , that they get boring very quickly , and in no time you would get bored of the current event you are doing.There are several game types that you can choose from , like Stunts , Baja , and some others that let you go through courses . These are n't that fun , for me.I do n't have much to say for this game , except I would not want anyone to get it , maybe if its in the bargain bin for 1.99..	-1
After suffering through the first & quot ; Who Wants to Be a Millionaire & quot ; game , I felt hopeless . I was dazed and confused . I did n't have a whisper of hope for the future of humanity . And then I saw the second game in the series on the shelves . I said , & quot ; I 'd heard the questions are n't repeated as much & quot ; , and I decided to buy it just to see if it was true.It 's true , the questions are n't repeated as much as before . The problem is , now they 're MUCH harder ! It 's impossible to get anything higher than $ 16,000 now ! And since the questions do n't repeat , you 'll never get to the top ! But what 's the worst part ? That 's the ONLY CHANGE that was made to this game . NOTHING ELSE ! ! ! ! ! It 's as if the first game had no problems whatsoever ! Regis is STILL appallingly rude and impatient , the & quot ; Fastest Finger & quot ; mode STILL does n't let you put the four answers in order , the game STILL quits if you take too long to do things , you STILL ca n't skip the introduction sequence , the Phone-a-friend lifeline is STILL worthless , there 's STILL no option to make the games easier or harder , you STILL only get instructions once , and there 's STILL no option to use the mouse ! Regis even says EXACTLY the same stuff as before ! I bought the game out of total curiosity , just to see if this game was really any better than the first . As it turns out , it is virtually the EXACT SAME GAME . It has all the problems of the first , except for one which was replaced by another one ! This game has not been improved one bit over the first . The makers did n't even try to improve it . This game displays total laziness and lack of creativity . It 's not worth one second of your time .	-1
Okay people it 's time for me to really point out reasons to NOT buy a PS2 now that I actually got several hours of gaming with this system ( And five different games ) to come up with my answer ! To start out I visited my friends house one day and saw his new Playstation 2 he had gotten . When I asked if we could play it , he did n't really want to ( This from a guy who has three and a half shelf 's with nothing but Playstation games ! ! ! That 's practically every game Sony made ! ! ! ) , but finally agreed . I can now see why . Not only were the games NOTHING Sony promised us ( They said the games were going to be a revolution . I fail to see how. ) . For one thing the graphics are nothing that the Dreamcast has n't offered us . For onther things were still getting the sames games over , and over ! Just with better graphics ! No internet play ( SEGA already has an advantage with that in mind ! ) , and did n't Sony promise us it would be compatable with Playstation games ? I thought so too . But only 3 of the 27 games we tried to do this with worked ! And it did n't enhance the graphics ! ! ! The DVD player is nothing but trash also . It wo n't play many movies , and those it does play do n't have very good quality ! Plus DVD players are on cell phones practically , why would we want them on a game counsel ( Especally if you 've already got a DVD player ) ! ? ! Plus almost all games ( Playstation or Playstation 2 games ) freeze up countless times ! In Tekken because I was fighting too fast the system froze up on me , but yet in Sonic Adventure ( On Dreamcast ) I 'm running on walls , jumping off buldings , and zooming around the place at 70 miles per hour and the game does n't glich once ! ! ! Now thats sad ( For Sony anyway ) . And when it comes down to the worst games I 've played yet , do n't expect this system to last long . With that in mind please be careful when buying this system , it might be worse thanyou thought it would be .	-1
All digimon fans out there rejoiced when this game came out , and so , so many were disappointed . Why ? Lets see Holy Highlighter 's standard breakdown : GRAPHICS : 2/10 - This game SORELY lacks , by any standards . While I was n't expecting it to rival high-end RPGs by high-end companies like Sony , Konami , and Square , this game 's graphics are remniscent of the earliest playstation games , and I thought developers had moved far beyond this . Blah ! Blah ! At least the FMV is decent.SOUND : 1/10 - Ok , the sound quality is just God awful . That , and the digimon sounds are really damn annoying , like the fact that a blaringly ugly sound is made every time a legless digimon & quot ; hops & quot ; . You would think that since this game would only become popular due to the TV show that they might have included the theme song ... but no , of course not ! CHARACTERS : 5/10 - The characters are decently developed , I suppose , and reflect the typical air-headed attitude of the TV show . The biggest gripe of most gamers is that none of the TV characters make an appearance ! What 's the point of having a Digimon game without any of the characters from the show ? Another fatal misstep on the part of the designers - most of the awesomely cool , powerful digimon from the show never show up . There is also very little control over which digimon your basic digimon evolves into , which annoys me greatly . The other annoying aspect is that every 2 hours of gameplay or so , your digimon dies and you have to start the process all ... over ... again.PLOT/STORYLINE : 2/10 - There is n't one . That 's all there is to say - the whole & quot ; lets bring digimon back to file city & quot ; crap is not plot , it 's a pathetic excuse . 99 % of the actions of the digimon do not revolve around the plot.SYSTEM/INTERFACE : 3/10 - The battle system is unique , which is the only plus this game has . In order to make your digimon even close to usable , you have to play an assortment of & quot ; minigames & quot ; , where you walk up to a sign , press a button , and lo-and-behold , your digimon gains stats . At first , I thought that letting the digimon participate longer in this game would make them gain more stat points - but it does n't matter , so basically more mindless button mashing is all that this thing does for you . Battling is 99 % of the game , and it gets boring relatively fast , especially since every 10 seconds or so you have to feed/clean up/immunize/rest your digimon . Even tamagotchi are n't this needy ! But there must be a positive thing somewhere , right ? Well , yes , the game is amusing for about an hour , before you realize that it 's just repetetive and does n't pass off as an RPG , or an action game , or anything else for that matter .	-1
Unlike the other reviews , i was very disappointed with the game . I was very excited the the game game out . Love the cartoon series . I made the mistake of purchasing it before testing it on a rental . I thought it moved too slowly and the battles with other digimon was unstimulating . The only good thing i can say about the game are the graphics are excellent and the sound FX are okay . Rent this game if you can before you purchase it - just in case you do'nt like it .	-1
Too many feedings and too many bathroom trips getsannoying fast.What did they put in the food-prunes ? Whenon the training field , i often had to stop training just somy digimon could use the bathroom.Most of the time , my digimondid n't make it to the bathroom on time , resulting in a ratherunsightly little pile.Another gripe is that my digimonevolved into the practically useless Numemon 98 % of thetime.I often let him get killed off until I got a digimonI liked.My advice is to rent this game .	-1
This was greatly disapointing , at the time it was released i was highly anticipating this game . Took some years later to get around to getting a copy , and it definitely was n't worth the wait.This is not worth even calling a game in my opinion . The fact you have to take your Digimon partner to the bathroom every 5minutes made me giveup my first game after a while of torturing myself and hoping it got better but kept getting more disapointed . If you do n't take your partner to the bathroom it poops on the ground , and if you walk too close after he eats it . And the only way to clean it is for him to eat it ( and it gets harder to avoid the more `` accidents '' your partner makes . Instead of a flash or something it makes you wait for your Digimon to use the potty . The character who is human do n't ever eat or use the toilet ( as far as i have seen ) , which is odd since your character is supposed to be a boy from the physical world , and your partner Digimon is supposed to be a digital monster ( so you would think the reverse would be more likely ) .So you are left with 2 options run to the bathroom to keep your partner from having an `` accident '' or let him have accidents and once he eats so many he 'll digivolve into Numemon Who is supposed to happen to digimon who are poorly trained and do n't have personal cleanliness ( but if you train and still make a few accidents but always feed your partner when he 's hungry he will still end up Numemon ) . And if your traveling to follow the story , it 's hard to time it so you find your way to the next bathroom before the next `` accident '' occurs.i will not buy or rent any of the next games , because this was such a failure . i mean do you train your dog to use the toilet , then watch him everytime he goes.. ? AGVN should review this , i mean the game is not fun at all what i have played . The sims i 'll admit the characters have to use the toilet occasionally , but it 's a longer time in-between bathroom breaks and you can switch between characters when one is in the bathroom you do n't have to watch and wait when you just want to play the darn game .	-1
okay i heard all the bad things about the game . but i thought nah it cant really be that bad , people are just expecting too much . well i was wrong , the game is that bad . and i tried so very very hard to like it . i love sports games and was addicted to nfl2k religiously , so when i heard sega was doing a baseball game i was waiting desperatly for it.unfortunatly it does n't come close to even triple play 99. the graphics are at times very very good , but they have a tendency to repeat the same things all the time . the pitcher does the same thing on the mound every time.the biggest problem is gameplay , it doesnt really have any . when you look at other baseball games out there on other systems this is sad . dreamcast has something to prove to both the people who have bought it and to psx addicts . that we hav n't made a mistake in buying and supporting the system . but with a title as bad as this it does n't help the cause.the commentary is the flatest , dullest most braindead there is . the difference in quality between nfl2k and ws2k1 is huge . nfl2k is a very cool game and nfl2k1 looks even better . if this game had been to its standard we would have had something to really write about.now my hope goes to espn baseball early next year .	-1
I 've been touting the Dream Cast 's sports game for some time now . Generally they are some of the best -- NFL 2K , NBA 2K , Virua Tennis ... I suppose it should n't come as a surprise that sooner or later I 'd find one that is n't that great . And I 'm not surprised it is the baseball game . Unlike football and basketball , there really is no movement in a baseball game , which I think is partially responsible for how much I dislike this game . Just being baseball itself . Add that to a difficulty in pitching and batting , and the problems with fielding a ball and you 've got a game that is n't real great ( I remember a nintendo baseball game that was more fun , even if the graphics were n't that great ) . I will say that the stadiums and graphics are beautiful , but it takes more than a pretty picture to make a fun game . And this game is n't much fun .	-1
This is the worst baseball game I ever played . I had moreenjoyment reading the negative reviews on this than actually playing this game . Every negative review about this game is 100 % correct . The only good thing about this is graphics . Game play stinks ( I do n't want the computer fielding for me or running bases ) and what ever happen to the infield fly rule . I was cought up in 5 tripple plays because the batter popped up in the infield with two men on base . This is crazy ! A total waist of money . I 'm putting this game up for sale after only having it for 1 day . ... Sega need to be sued for false advertisment . Most of the info on the back of this game is false . No hot or cold zones , no 32 different pitches ( if there is , the game book does n't tell you how to throw them ) , ca n't control base running , the men on base are running on every hit ball no matter what base they 're on or the amount of outs in the inning . SEGA , CAN I GET MY MONEY BACK AND AT A 10 % INCREASE OF FUNDS FOR PUTTING UP WITH THIS FOR A DAY . Pedro , I like you as a Red Sox Pitcher but disappointed that you got your face on the cover of this game.oNe	-1
I was all pumped up about Dreamcast 's first baseball game . I went out and reserved the game . Bought it the day it came out , and found out that it was a huge disappointment ! I 've only played it twice so far , but I could tell that they were in a hurry to get this game out ! First of all , THERE 's IS NO HOMERUN DERBY in the game ! If you think about it , ALMOST ALL baseball games have a home run derby . Why does n't this game have one ? Another huge let down was that this game only allows up to 2 players . That 's pretty sad , considering NBA2000 and NFL2000 gives you the ability of up to 4 players . I also found that it was unusual that you have to hold down the & quot ; R & quot ; button then release it to hit the ball . Also , PacBell park does n't look like the real one . The only thing that the game has going for it so far is the graphics . It is by far superior then any other baseball game out there . Now keep in mind that these were the things I caught after only playing it twice . It probably has tons of glitches such as NBA2000 and NFL2000 . Do n't get me wrong , there all great games , but they need to stop putting out games in a hurry !	-1
how can this game be good if you can not even control your fielders.So what i am trying to get to you is what kind of a baseball fan likes a game where the computer controls your fielders and not you.There are also other glitches in the game like sometimes in the infield your infielder runs in place before catching the groundball whitch results to the computer being safe on first.There is one good thing world series baseball 2K1 has good updated rosters for the 2000 season not the 2001 season.Also pitching to the batters can be fun but with all the glitches and not being able to control all your fielders drags the game down to a two.I really had high hopes for 2K1 to bad the game is not good .	-1
Sega has never let us down with every release of its top-notch baseball game , World Series Baseball . It has always been the game to beat . Until now . It boggles the mind how Sega refused to even remotely worry about the people actually playing this piece of garbage . Sure , the graphics are the most superb I 've ever witnessed . But the inability to control your fielders is NOT a good thing . Add that to the fact that your fielders also seem to be playing for your opponents , ( I 'm sorry , but you just do not wait until a line drive is right next to you before deciding to move after it . ) and you 've got the worst game ever . Not the worst sports game , the worst GAME EVER . PERIOD . I WOULD N'T MAKE MY WORST ENEMY PLAY THIS.Graphics : 9 - it just do n't get better Control : 4 - yeah , so you can throw and swing ... so what ? Sound : 5 - it 's a baseball game ... what 'd you expect , Metallica ? & quot ; Fun-ocity & quot ; : 2 -me no like much.OVERALL : 1 star - This game is a lot like those certain girls in High School ; looks good , but you still would n't touch it with a 10-foot pole .	-1
A total waste of time ! ! Never has a game with such potential and mouth dropping graphics been soo horrible . I got the game thinkin I could get atleast a little enjoyment out of what seemed to be a great game . But as I began to play a little and realized how bad the game really was I started to wonder if it was the same game as shown on the case ? But after minutes trying to convince myself that the store had made a mistake packaging , I realized I made the mistake of buying the awful game . No lie here , the worst baseball game to date , hands down . Just take my advice , stay away !	-1
Everyone who owned a Dreamacst could n't wait ! They were sitting on the edge of their seat just waiting and waiting for the arrival of the first baseball game for the Dreamcast ! World Series Baseball 2K1.Everyone who bought it , including me was shocked . Did Sega forget that a great baseball video game is more than just graphics ? When I got this game along with NBA 2K1 and NFL 2K1 I was amazed by the graphics . Preston Wilson looked , batted and threw exactly like he actually does and the stadiums were just breathtaking.I could n't wait to get into the game so I did an exhibition game . I was stunned ! There was no maual-fielding option , hitting was nearly impossible and getting through an inning without getting shelled was just as hard . I played this game for about 10 minutes trying to figure out if it was just me that I was so bad and that there was no manual-fielding , but I realized that 's the way the game is . After playing once or maybe twice I put this game away for good then traded it in along with a few other games for Sonic Adventure 2 and Soul Calibur . That 's probably the best move I ever had made.I now own World Series Baseball 2K2 because I knew it could n't get any worse . The player graphics are worse , but the stadium 's are more detailed . The rosters are more up-to-date , the gameplay is excellent , pitching is fun , hitting has been improved a lot and of course you can actually field unlike this game ! WSB 2K1 is a terrible game . If you want a baseball game for your Dreamcast get WSB 2K2 . It 's awesome !	-1
I wish that I used to review games as a job because the only way I can play World Series Baseball 2K1 is if I were paid to do it ! !	-1
This game has some cool features -- the batter/pitcher matchup is reasonably good ; players are ( except when they 're sitting on the bench ) very realistic-looking . It also does n't eat an entire memory card like NFL 2K -- just a little over half of one.The bad news , though , is that there are some INCREDIBLY big problems with gameplay . Number one : FIELDING FIELDING FIELDING . The worst are grounders through the & quot ; gap & quot ; between first and second . The first baseman is apparently unable to move even three feet to his right in order to snag the ball . Ugly.Number two : baserunning . How many major-leaguers have *you* seen running on an infield popup with less than two out ? Play this game at all , and you 'll see guys who get paid more than the GNP of some small countries making that very same bonehead move . The player has to physically remind his baserunners to return to base on a pop-fly.These two very large problems are enough to really take a lot of the enjoyment out of what would otherwise be a very good game.There are some other problems , too : the little graphic that shows where the ball ( tiny white pixel ) , defensive players ( tiny blue pixels ) and runners ( tiny yellow pixel that is nearly indistinguishable from the ball ) is almost completely useless . The fans in the stands look like something out of a Nintendo 64 game . There 's no way to skip past the incredibly awful renditions of the national anthem at the beginning of each game . The replays are n't very interesting . The commentary is wooden and nowhere near as well-done as in , say , one of the excellent NFL games . The controls are not always very intuitive or responsive ( especially irritating when you 're frantically pressing B to get your idiot baserunners to return to base while they blithely jog along , finally realizing that Oh ! You want them to DO something ! ) . These are all pretty petty little quibbles , really , and none of them would be enough to really make this a bad game by themselves , but when combined with the fielding and baserunning problems , the annoyances just mount and mount until you want to chuck your controller at the TV . ( Barely ) worth the $ 15 I spent on it used -- for the graphics and to tide me over until WSB2K2 comes out in a couple of weeks .	-1
This game has great graphics , of course ; but the game play is equally reciprocated . In this game you are only allowed to throw and hit . All the excitement of robbing your opponent of a home run with a stellar catch or a taking away a base hit with a diving catch is taken away . You can not play defense at all ! Your job is to throw in the right direction , but that is even tasking because the response time is so slow that you have to press the throw button repeatedly . Even if you get the throw off in time , your player receiving the throw will take a couple seconds before he finally attempts to make a tag ; and by then it 's obviously too late . Speaking of delayed reactions , the commentary is too monotonous and belongs with the ranks of Genesis games . I would take the classic , & quot ; Bases Loaded & quot ; , over this junk any day .	-1
Well , the graphics are amazing and the batter pitcher interface is smooth and well thought out . The rest , however , should have been worked on a little more.The greatest strength is by far the pitcher batter match-up . When playing against another player , the game simulates reality very well . The pitcher can set up the batter like in a real baseball game . You can throw a fast ball high and tight , and then fake the batter by going low and inside with a change up.The biggest problem I have is that about half of all at-bats are pop-ups to the infield . The rest are harmless grounders or strikeouts . This game is incredibly difficult to hit with , and makes it lack really any playability.Other problems are that stats are not readily available at the end of a game , the sound is reminiscent of a bad Genesis game , controlling runners is a pain , and there is not much control on defense.This game is like an untested prospect , lots of potential , but not really ready for the big time . Best to wait for World Series 2002 , if the Dreamcast can survive that long .	-1
Please do n't get this game it sure aint worth any ten bucks heck I wouldnt pay 50 cents for it worst game I own	-1
I expected a lot from Sega as they have delivered on almost every account of the & quot ; World Series Baseball & quot ; series ( no pun intended ) . Also with the Dreamcast finally deciding to show its true ability , I saw stills of this game and was in awe . This very quickly ended as I first played the game . Oh my god , yes the graphics are amazing . That is where it ends . Players are detailed and stadiums are replicated down to the upperdeck chairs . But this cant save the game . The control is quirky at best , batting is a real hastle . Hmm , perhaps defense will be better . No , quite the contrary . There is absolutely no fielding whatsoever . The ball flys in the air and the computer moves a player to the spot then u decide which base to throw too . Sound like fun ? Didnt think so . Lets go try another mode . HA ! No extra mode for you ! We are presented with exhibition and season . Oh well , lets try playing a season with some of our friends . Nope , cant play on the same team as a friend . With lack of extras , poor control and lack of it as well , and no team playing , this game avois a 1 star with its amazing graphics . This game is horrid to play and I strongly suggest playing Tommy Lasorda Baseball for Sega Genesis over this game . At least you can field ... .	-1
Shen Mue has received rave reviews from almost every on-line site and magazine that I have come across . But interestingly enough , almost every reader board I have seen on-line has expressed a very different opinion : This game was terribly disappointing . I 'm an RPG fan , so I 'm used to running around towns and talking to people , but when you 're FORCED to do this for HOURS on end without any action , it gets tedious ... and more tedious ... and frustrating ... and finally , you want to throw your Dreamcast out the window ! I honestly think that the only reason this game received such great reviews was simply because it was one of the first RPGs on Dreamcast . Now that Grandia II , Phantasy Star , and Skies of Arcadia have been released , RPG-lovers have a MUCH better selection to choose from . Pick up one of those great games instead , and do n't even bother with Shen Mue . From start to finish , it 's just one big disappointment after another ...	-1
Well I thought I was getting sooooooo much more after all the hype , but honestly this was just plain boring . Pretty to look at , but shoddy controls and not enough fun stuff to do . mostly running around talking to npcs [ non player characters ] and opening doors looking for npcs . YAWN ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Yes it looks pretty but unless you like long drawn out storys and watching a game more then playing skip it ... ..	-1
The one word to best describe Shenmue is not & quot ; groundbreaking & quot ; its repetative . Talk to 50 persons to find the one with the clue to carry the game forward and when you get that , repeat ! Action is sparse and senseless wandering is essential to the game . I HATE talking to EVERYBODY to discover that I have to go to meet someone the next night ! To make things worse youu ca n't skip time so you really have to wait and wait and wait . The & quot ; Quick time events & quot ; are cool but too far apart to save this snooze fest . Shenmue got old after Disc 1 and went downhill from there.The graphics are awesome and the idea behind the game is cool but not well done . This game can put you to sleep faster than sleeping pills . The worst part of this game is working in the harbour for 5 days and having to do that stupid forklift race each day , yawn and tedious to the MAX . I have no desire to finish the game as you never face the bad guy , not even in part 2 you just keep walking and talking , walking and talkin , walking and talking ( get the point of this game ) . If you like wasting precious life that could be used to live then this is for you ... otherwise get a more fulfilling gaming experience elsewhere.Two stars for graphics and innovative concept .	-1
With all of the hype surrounding this game , I thought it would be a whole lot better than this . Of course by now you 've heard about the great graphics . Okay , I 'll give you that , but I want a game not a movie , so I care about how it plays and that 's where 'Shenmue ' falters . The gameplay consists of punch-punch-kick style action and at times it 's restricted to you hitting one button along with the movie scene . 'Yawn ' . I actually dropped off a little during part of it ; no joke . While it is certainly a technical achievement , it 's more movie than game .	-1
This game is one of the most time-consuming and frivolous games out there for the Dreamcast . The missions are dull with hardly any decent action . The one quest that stands out in my mind the most is one where you have to find Mr. Yakamoto . You are given no idea as to where he lives and go door to door trying to find him . It always happens that his house is the last you look at . Another problem is the fact that many of the quests are given to you at one time and you have to wait 24 hours before you can actually do them . There is no way to make time go forward so about 35 of the 40 hours needed to complete this game will be on waiting around for the place you need to go to open.This game is very disappointing and if you are somewhat interested in it , borrow it from a friend . If you do n't have any friends , then only dish out the $ 6 to rent only if you think you might like it .	-1
This is a good game , but not a great one . I hate to say it ( because I like the loose concept of the game ) , but I was disappointed with Shenmue . I have to give recognition to the fine artistry and graphical quality . However , herein lies the problem.So much emphasis was put on the graphics that they forgot to add the game . Shenmue really is n't a video game at all . It is more like you are watching a movie and every once and awhile you have to pause it , do some tedious task , and then you get to watch a little more . You really do n't feel like part of the game . It often felt to me that I was not playing at all , but watching someone else play . I kept waiting my turn , and before I got my turn the game was over . This problem was also exemplified by the fact that you can not die ( lose , be killed , whatever you choose to call it ) . I do n't know about you , but I like a bit of a challenge . Not even having Ryo 's fate in my hands made me feel even more like a bystander.One other problem I have ( probably the most significant to me ) is that after all that `` playing '' you find out that you are just going to have to wait for the next video game to see what happens . You can form your own opinions about that , but I have to admit that I felt a bit taken . I just wanted to play a game . I did n't sign up for some long-term deal where I would have to buy several sets of discs to find out what happens . They should call the game Shenmue : Chapter One . At least then you would know that your entire [ money ] is going to only one chapter and not an entire game.If you want to see some great graphics and casually watch one chapter of a story unfold , then this game is for you . However , if you want a challenge , the possibility of losing , a game that may come out differently if you were to play it again , I do n't think Shenmue is for you . I recommend Half-Life and Final Fantasy 9 for many hours of video game enjoyment . Happy gaming .	-1
When I first bought this game after getting my Dreamcast , I thought it was decent . I really did n't like the time limit , I did n't like the fact that the `` spray '' button and the `` center camera '' button were both mapped to the same button , and I did n't like the mediocre frame rate . But I liked the graphic style , and the soundtrack was pretty cool.After playing the Xbox-only sequel , Jet Set Radio Future , I realized that it had everything this game was missing . Why put the primary function that needs a clear view on the same button as the one that resets your view - especially when there 's no manual camera control ( a problem with many Dreamcast games ) ? Answer : Do n't , especially when there 's a whole other button ( the right trigger ) that is n't being used . JSRF fixed that problem easily.Why have a time limit when your character both moves slowly , and is always being chased by police ? Answer : Do n't . Get rid of the time limit , speed up the character 's movement , and restrict the police encounters to certain areas . JSRF fixed those problems easily.I 'll admit , the better graphics and frame rate are the result of moving to a higher-powered system instead . So I wo n't fault the game for not being on better hardware when said hardware did n't exist at the time.It might seem like I 'm just bashing this game for not being the second one , but ... actually , that 's exactly what I 'm doing . Jet Set Radio Future is more fun , less frustrating , has better controls , and ( since it was briefly the pack-in game for the Xbox ) is going to be cheaper . Buy it , and leave this one as what it is : a rather uncomfortable stepping stone to a smooth rock that 's aged far better .	-1
The concept of making Wario immortal was , in my opinion , a stroke of genius , and handled flawlessly in Warioland 2 . In this game , however , it wears thin very quickly , especially in the Boss battles , where one hit is often enough to send Wario flying off the screen , making it almost impossible to beat any given boss in less then seven tries.The game 's level design must 've looked good on paper , but is very poorly executed . You must go through each stage four or five times to find all the keys , chests and tresaures . Time of day is factored as well , and after finding a tresure almost every stage in the game is radically changed . For example , find the seeds in one level , and now there are huge vines growing everywhere in the levels you 've already completed , allowing access to new areas and items . It can get very repetitives very quickly.Also , for some reason , Warioland 3 has the worst graphics of the series . The first game even looks better . Backgrounds are almost nonexistant , textures are bland , and , although this game was the first made specifically for the Game Boy Color , Wario is made up of only two colors . Huh ? On top of all of this , you must track down your abilities , which Wario seems to have lost since the end of the last game . While this system worked wonders in Metroid Fusion , it 's tedious and unnecissary in this game , the weakest of the otherwise outstanding Wario series .	-1
Let me start off by saying that I am a huge nintendo fan and the DK games are some of my all time favs . DK country on the super nes is a true platform classic . Now when I heard that game was being ported to the GBC I was excited . I remembered how great the DK Land games were on the gameboy , so I knew that this game would be just as good.The moment I got this for my birthday , I hurridly popped it into my gameboy . The game at first seemed alright , the sprites and graphics during gameplay Looked Like crap and moved super stiffly . Even the older DK Land games had better physics . But I chugged along with the game , upon getting further in the game I just could n't take it anymore , the crappy gameplay got to me enough , I could not play it anymore , it kept pissing me off , this was nowhere near as fun as the supernes version.In the end I ended up throwing the cartridge against the wall . Be smart and stay away from this piece of junk , go buy the GBA version or supernes version or buy it off the VC . I Love DK but this game is pure garbage .	-1
I owned this game when i got a game boy advance and I can tell you : IT SUCKED ! ! ! Graphics 0/10- Terrible Graphics . Even an arcade game would have better graphics . other GBC Games would have better graphics . I am disgusted.Music 0/10- They screwed up the music and put other stuff in the game.Game Play -5/1000- harder and less fun.Overall -5,000,000/10- Stay away from it .	-1
It 's too late to have a refund , but the Rumble Pak does n't work . PLUS , the seller did n't take out the batteries . Really ? Want battery acid all over it ?	-1
This is only a rumble if you are under 8 years old , otherwise it & # 8217 ; s ... tremble that is not worth the money or the AA batteries that you need for it . The Rumble Pack fits into the slot of your N64 controller , and then a save pack fits into the Rumble Pack , making the controller quite heavy ! There are two settings for the pack , low and high . Another annoying part of the pack is that there are two modes , one to turn the Rumble Pack on , and the other to work your gamepack to save games . Its just a hassle , and the only games that really use it are Zelda when you are fishing and sporting games , so you can feel the action .	-1
I have a love-hate relationship with this game . I 've played it for hours and hours and gotten a lot of fun out of it . But there are three things that I have done my best to overlook but can not :1 . That the thing is full of bugs ! Presumably this is because it was rushed to `` press '' to coincide with the release of the 4th STAR WARS film -- who knows ? But there are many times when your guy will suddenly die for no reason because you fell down some invisible hole , that kind of thing.2 . Your lightsaber is absurdly weak . In the movie , the Jedis lightsabers cut through those droids on Naboo like butter . In this game , you 'll be giving them three or four whacks . That does n't look right , and that 's not all : the droids can give you a vicious uppercut that will fling you back about 20 feet or so . It makes for some absurd viewing.3 . Back in the day I remember a couple of gamers who nicknamed this `` Jumping Jedis . '' Jumping challenges are par for the course with such video games , I guess , but the problem was the program 's lighting , shadow-rendering , resolution -- or whatever -- was not good enough for such contests to be fair . There 's one fairly hellish sequence on Tatooine where you ca n't tell where your guy is , how far he has to jump , which way exactly he is facing , etc . I think the game should have toned down all the jumping challenges until they were able to render the graphics with enough precision that you can tell where your effin ' guy is on the screen .	-1
This game is Very boring , all you do is kill the andorids in your way ( which is Easy to accomplish ) and then your faced with a big robot ( and you think that is the end of level 1 it NOT ) then you kill more andriod then your faced with a bit space ship . This game reminds me of the old Mario bros games , where you walk foward and get to the end . I was excpeting this game to be more like Spyro with hiden rooms , challanging villians and clues to figure out this game is so NOT like that ! ! Also my biggest Pet peeve about this game is you can not Save it at any time . You have to complete the Whole level before it will let you save your game . After playing for 3 hours and not finishing level 1 , I unfortunatly died and was NOT allowed to save my progress . I had to start ALL over from the begaining . It took me another 4 hours to finish level 1 ( after starting over from the begaining 50 times ) When I finally finished level 1 I was FINALLY allowed to Save my game which SUCKS . If you get tired and want to save the game and come back later you CA N'T you 'll have to finish the level before you can save it .	-1
The storyline seemed borrowed , the first game that came to mind was legend of legaia . A big problem for me was the battle system ussualy i can stay up late and play videogames , but with this the attacks were insanely hard to do . I ended up missing more than i was hitting . The best part was the videos were crazy cool and probaly why it was so many cd 's . It 's a long game and if you like it you will love it and if you hate it you wo n't be able to get through one cd .	-1
This is the first RPG I could n't finish . Its not because it was difficult . I stopped playing out of my own will because ths was , simply put , the most generic , boring RPG I have ever laid my eyes upon.What would have become a great game changed into a catastrophic failure . First off , these characters looked like they were taken from FFVII , given a different haricut , and stripped of all their personality . Dart looks a lot like Cloud . Shawna looks a lot like Tifa . See some sort of resemblance here ? Now if only the in-game 3D models moved and looked as good as Square 's offerings . The characters lack any real depth of color , and the animation is choppy . The music lacks any power at all ; this was also the first game I turned the sound off for . The songs were too repetitive and the voice-overs were pathetic.Now my main gripe : The plot . What kind of half-assed shit is this ? As one person put it , & quot ; I 've seen a Power Rangers episode with a better storyline. & quot ; The plot does nothing to keep you in its grasps to make the game at leats somewhat attractive to its players . The first plot twist will occur at the end of the second disc . That 's about 20-25 hours away for things to get interesting . That would be a little forgiveable if only the characters were n't so damn boring . Each character sounds the same , they lack diversity , with one exception : the really big guy that sounds like a retard ( I ca n't remember his name at the moment ) .I will , however , give credit where credit is due : This game , while it has lackluster character models , also features some of the finest looking FMVs and backgrounds to ever grace the Playstation . If you 're a gamer that enjoys great eye candy most of all , this is the game for you . If you enjoy strong plots , go with Xenogears ( if you can find it ) or Chrono Cross . If you like three dimentional , realistic , likable characters , pick out a Final Fantasy or a Lunar game .	-1
What a generic title . Given the game , that 's par for the course . The Legend of Dragoon is certainly the most generic game I 've played on the Playstation . It 's sort of sad , in many ways , that it was released by SCEA only months before Chrono Cross and Final Fantasy IX , and over a year after Final Fantasy VIII.What 's generic about it ? Damn near everything . The main character is a spiky-haired blonde dude whose small village is destroyed by an evil empire , and who is designated the `` chosen one '' by a pendant , previously possessed by a mysterious stranger . Can you even name how many other games that borrows from ? Do numbers go that high ? And I forgot to mention , his representative color is red . Of course , the empire is still on the prowl , and Dart has to chase them with a diverse group of heroes.And that 's not even touching the translation- The Legend of Dragoon boasts some truly embarrassing translation errors . Square learned this lesson after Final Fantasy VII , which took a lot of flack for its stereotypes and writing , but that game had an interesting setting and strong enough characters to make up for it . The Legend of Dragoon was n't just several years behind , it was at least two games behind by PS1 jRPG standards.While the story is generic and perfunctory , it 's not really the problem . Let 's talk about the combat . The Legend of Dragoon 's basis for combat is a series of timed button presses known as `` additions . '' When one chooses the attack option , a reticle focuses in on the enemy , and a button must be pressed to time with the animation . While this basic idea has been done in other games , like Vagrant Story , Final Fantasy VIII , and the Mario and Luigi series , The Legend of Dragoon makes it the core of combat , and that 's a fatal error . While timed button presses were integral to the games I mentioned , the important thing is that they did n't slow down the combat . The Legend of Dragoon 's combat forces you to do this chain of animations every time you click attack , and when you miss , you get to see your character freeze in place as a number appears only once in front of the enemy . Random encounters , which are the majority of the game in RPGs , take forever and feel clunky . The Dragoon transformations- a flashy sequence comparable to Power Rangers- are also longer than necessary and the Dragoon attacks do little to change my complaints about the rest of the game.The look of the game is very generic as well . While the pre-rendered backgrounds of the game look fine , the character models outside of combat are simplistic and poorly animated . The in-combat look is marginally better , and while the Dragoon transformations look good , the default character models are n't very detailed , and neither are the enemies . The combat environments look especially poor- many of the floors and walls are a single polygon with a blocky texture applied to it.As far as I 'm concerned , the great-looking cinematics do n't count when we 're talking about graphics , though it is worth noting that the ones in The Legend of Dragoon look great . But you might as well jump on youtube and watch all of them instead of playing the game , or rent Advent Children or The Spirits Within , or Shrek for that matter , if that 's all you care about . The art design of the game does n't lend itself to Playstation 's technology.I hesitate to speculate on matters like this , but The Legend of Dragoon strikes me as an attempt by Sony to cash in after the success of Final Fantasy VII . The game looks an awful lot like that game , with a fantasy setting substituted for a steam/cyberpunk one . I would n't call that an improvement .	-1
Legend of Dragoon is one of those games that you either love or despise , I of course belong to the later group.As one reviewer already mentioned , Legend of Dragoon was Sony 's answer to rival Square-Enix 's insanely popular Final Fantasy VII . I have to laugh when it took them three years to cook up this title that ca n't even dent the Final Fantasy fanchise.I do n't think the Final Fantasy series is the greatest thing since sliced bread ( I actually like the Wild Arms series the most ) , but the only thing Legend of Dragoon really had going for it was its graphics , which I will admit where pretty sweet at the time.Outside the graphical engine , Legend of Dragoon is second rate RPG in every category . Lame enemies , lackluster story , generic locations , and some of the worst music to ever accompany an PSX RPG ever ( it 's really that bad ) . Fights are also annoying due to the so-called `` Additions '' system which has you doing timed hits all day ( yeah , that 's what I call fun when I have to hit a button 8 times in a row at just the correct moment just to attack ) .Other problems also arise , such as the fact no one can use magic outside of their dragoon transformations , meaning their is really no way to heal your characters except for items ( which you become way too dependent on in this game , and can only carry so many ) . Outside the dragoon tranformations the battle system is very weak.Play Legend of Dragoon only after you have destroyed every other PSX PRG . By that time you 'll realize that this is not what any and all PSX RPG 's should be compared against . Even if Final Fantasy is extremely overrated at times , even the worst FF is better than this . I do n't think I 'll play this one again .	-1
Is one of my favorite games . When I first started playing it , it was doing good . Then it kept freezing and I had to return it .	-1
I thought that this would be an excellent RPG like FF series , but I was horribly wrong . It had an extremely linear storyline , with uninteresting characters and the controls were awful . The graphics were not bad but very few CG scenes . Seriously , I would n't recommend this to anyone unless if you are a true RPG Gamer . I like RPGs but I had to stop playing this game on the second disc . It was still too boring and the story was n't going anywhere . I gave it two stars for the graphics and that 's it .	-1
I played this game for several days , because although I was having very little fun from the start , I could n't identify the reason . Usually , when I dislike a game this much , I always have some overriding reason why , such as `` the story is a bore , '' `` the battles are tedious '' , or even `` the graphics are so bad that I ca n't even see it '' . LOD had none of these problems , but I just could n't get into it . I got all the way up to disc 2 , and yet it still felt like pulling teeth just to turn on the PSone , so I put it away and bought .hack . I wound up having a lot more fun , even though that game 's story did n't make any sense -- go figure . By reading the reviews here , it seems that plenty of other people were disinterested too , so I 'm not alone I guess : )	-1
`` I will stop you to go forward '' the portal watcher of Ulara said to me , the main protagonist . Of course what she meant was `` I wo n't let you pass . `` Above is just one hilarious example of the terrible dialogue in this game . The dialogue is consistently this bad throughout the entire game , demeaning the characters , story , and entire game to amateur level.Dungeons are the heart of this game 's gameplay , which are long and tedious . Same areas are used in different locations with at least one battle in each area . The numerous battles and repetitious dungeons make the gameplay incredibly slow and dry.Supposedly this game is well known for its cool battle quirks . This is true , almost everything you do in a battle is effected in some way by player performance . However I did not find this to be enjoyable . After hundreds of battles I was pleading for the game to automate my attacks . Repetition of button-timing and button-mashing mini games during battles became tiresome extremely fast.Soundtrack was quite nice though , paralleling Final Fantasy series quality . This however does n't make up for the rest of this mess.With poor story and gameplay , this game is not something I enjoyed playing .	-1
There is no way this game could be fun at all . All you can do is select a ship , you ca n't even build your own you have to choose A preselected class , choose your crew , you can read there bio but it most often wo n't help you choose , then you install parts , you cant even place the parts in your ship they just appear there and the part discription is n't helpfull at all , then select A misson and just watch an icon travel over A 1D map of space in real time with an occasional mini movie . Very boring Do n't waste your money .	-1
First off ... any of Simon and Schuster 's Trek games are virtually impossible to get to run on a modern system without extensive effort and technical know-how , and this is no exception.There are multiple S & S ; software items out there . The `` Interactive Technical Manual , '' the `` Captain 's Chair , '' the `` Omnipedia '' ( and `` Omnipedia Update '' ) , the `` Interactive Encyclopedia , the `` Star Trek - Borg '' and `` Star Trek - Klingon '' interactive movies , the `` Starship Creator '' programs , and `` Deep Space 9 - Dominion Wars '' ( the only conventional `` game '' in the bunch ) .ALL , except Dominion Wars , use Quicktime ( and Macromedia Director ) as their media playback tools . It 's entirely possible to get the `` Director '' program to run on any 32-bit computer ( but do n't bother on a 64-bit version except in a virtual machine ) . And it 's entirely possible to have the version ( s ) of Quicktime these various programs require installed , provided you do n't have LATER versions of Quicktime installed , again , on a 32-bit machine , but not on a 64-bit one ( except if using a VM ) .The biggest problems ultimately come from the use of Director ( as the playback framework ) , which used to be owned by Macromedia but is now owned by Adobe ( who have it available for download , but have n't touched it in years ) , and from Quicktime.Quicktime is HORRIBLE ... because Apple ( the maker of Quicktime ) released later version of the `` same software '' which have NOTHING to do with the earlier versions whatsoever , and are not compatible . Oh , and Apple likes to install `` extras '' which do fun things to your computer ... like a recent `` iTunes '' update which caused CD/DVD drives on tens of thousands of user 's computers to `` disappear '' from Windows Explorer ) . Apple , frankly , is responsible for more `` bad things '' happening to my Windows based computer than anything else I 've ever encountered . And I LIKE competition . I just dislike `` sabotage . `` In my case , I have abandoned all hope of getting any of them to run properly in windows . But I have had good luck installing and running them using `` Microsoft Virtual PC 2007 '' with an installation of Windows 98SE running inside of that virtual machine , running on a Windows XP `` real '' machine . I see no reason that this would not work just fine in the virtual machine in Windows 7 , for that matter ... but you NEED to be able to install Windows 9x into a virtual machine , it seems , so if you do n't still have an old copy of the installer disk for one of the Win9x operating systems , you 're likely out of luck.So , the ONLY way I 'll install Apple software ( old or new ) is in a virtual machine . That way it ca n't break my main installation again ( as has happened more than once ) . Fortunately , in the case of the Simon and Schuster applications ( except for `` Dominion Wars '' ) this works out perfectly well ! So ... now that you know how to make it run , let 's talk about what it actually is.This is NOT an `` action game , '' nor is it a `` tactical simulation . '' And it 's not really a `` technical reference '' either . It tries to be a hybrid of all three . But it does n't do any of them very well.Basically ... you start off by creating a `` user account '' within the game . This is not a bad approach , as you can create as many `` users '' as you wish . That would be great if there were several people in your home all wanting to play this , or if you wanted to create multiple independent game sessions . Each users is an `` Admiral , '' and the concept is that you 're in charge of a fleet.You have a limited amount of `` Federation Credits '' which you can use to buy and outfit ships in your fleet . You earn more credits by completing missions . So far , so good ... right ? You pick a ship `` class , '' and then get to pick and choose from some alternative part appearances , making your ship look unique . You get to pick a name ( and a registration number ) for your ship . And there is a small 3D interface within the game which allows you to see a low-polygon-count version of the ship you 've assembled . This is the ONLY `` 3D '' element of the entire game , though , and it does n't really add much `` coolness factor '' to the game , really . Okay , you also get to see the same 3D low-poly-count model when you log out of the game . ) They did provide an option to export your custom ship configuration to the only REAL `` game '' S & S ; put out , Dominion Wars , with the `` Warp 2 '' version of this program . So , that 's of some minor interest.You then start choosing systems ( which cost credits ) for your ship . You get a fair amount of potential tweaking for any ship , and there 's a fair amount of technical-manual-type information about each system you 're choosing to install . Eventually , you 'll want to upgrade every ship in your fleet to the max settings , though ... initially , it 's just a matter of determining what to buy first.You also get to pick a crew ( or rather , key crewmembers ... you do n't pick the entire crew ! ) . These are MOSTLY characters from on-screen Trek . It 's possible to create your own characters , though not from within the application , and there used to be some `` extra downloadable crew '' ( I got those for Peter David 's `` New Frontier '' novels , for example ) . Again , the crew costs money , but you 'll eventually want to `` upgrade '' to the best available for each ship , so it 's really a matter of choosing what to upgrade first.Once you have a ship that you think is suitable , you choose a mission to send the ship on . Success in a mission earns you more credits.The problem is that the gameplay at this point can not really be called `` gameplay '' at all . Rather , you have a small window which is essentially a `` map '' and a scrolling `` communications message list . '' And you just sit there and watch things unfold . If you set the speed to be higher , this can happen quickly , but if you 're letting it go in `` real time , '' get a book to read between messages and events.You do n't get to watch the ship doing things in real 3D . You do n't HEAR the comm chatter . You do n't have any real control over what 's happening at this point . You just ... sit , watch , and wait.Okay , there 's some interest in discovering if you have come up with the best configuration for your ship ( s ) for a particular mission ... but this is about the most tedious way of doing that I could imagine.The sad thing is , if someone were to try to remake this today , and use voice actors , modern graphical presentation ( including 3D inside and outside the ship you 're `` watching '' ) and so forth , it might actually make for a reasonably fun game . The CONCEPT is n't terrible , but the execution is.I tried to like it ... I really did . The idea had some great potential . But the execution is , frankly , only suitable for aiding in combating insomnia.Out of all of the S & S ; programs ( and I purchased them all ) , the `` Starship Creator '' games are the only ones I have no interest in getting running again .	-1
Considering how bad the first one was I did n't expect its sequel to be any different . It was n't combines the worst of all worlds , chessy soudtrack , chessy graphics and a missions operations manual that defifes all logic and reason .	-1
This seems to be the general sentiment about this game and its true : It has all the problems that the first version has.You get more ship hulls to work with , that is true , but that 's about it . The game still has the same lame missions that take forever to play and ARE NOT FUN ! Also , the user interface is still pretty much the same.The developers needed to make some major changes in this version , such as being able to captain the ship you built ( even in a limited & quot ; Star Fleet Academy & quot ; manner ) and to unlock better hulls and equipment other than using the & quot ; credit & quot ; system . How about promotions to higher engineering positions ? That makes more sense . I downloaded a money cheat so I could mess with different hulls without playing all those tedious missions . This extended the game 's life on my PC by a week but I still got frustrated by not being able to fully interact with my creations.I though that was the whole point behind this game .	-1
What in the name of creation led to the production of this revolting pile of poop . If Starship Creator and its Deluxe edition were n't enough of an embarrassment , then the authors certainly achieved what has to be the greatest defacation of software garbage in the ST gaming genre . I personally could n't believe that I actually bought this worthless piece of junk , but in saving face , I can admit that I did so based on name alone- lowering my opinion for the licensing standards of the ST name that Paramount retains . Whoever created second edition of this game should be shot . It maintains the same rediculous promises that it never delivers in previous versions and worse yet , it leaves out ships that were part of previous releases . On the upside , it allows you to export the ships you create the into Dominion Wars DS9 game which might be useful . Otherwise , you are wasting time as far as a stand alone product , especially if you are expecting to have a good time . Evidently , what passes for fun with Simon & amp ; Schuster is the kind of game that plays like a DOS reject , without the frills , bells or whistles . To make matters worse , its graphic content reflects this philosophy making it the worst ST game I have ever played . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME . You will not experience any actual gameplay outside of selecting parts or crew members from a list . This game bites .	-1
This game was actually a freebie when I bought Star Trek Deep Space Nine Dominion Wars . I recently bought Star Trek Starship Creator Deluxe which was made a year before this Warp 2 sequel.Starship Creator Deluxe has much more ship constructions to chose from than the new Warp 2 has to offer . In Warp 2 you only get Akira , Soveriegn , Intrepid , Constitution , Defiant , Galaxy , and Klingon B'rel Class Ships to construct . In Starship Creator Deluxe ( which by the way includes Starship Creator and Starship Creator Add-on ) you may construct from more than 10 different ships - Excelsior , Miranda , Constitution , Defiant , Akira , Oberth , Prometheus , Soveriegn , Intrepid , and Galaxy . Warp 2 has less ships and the missions are pretty boring . You could sleep through it and the mission would still be successful . The computer plays the missions out without any real play control from the player . You can however design that dream starship you always wanted to create . If you really want to buy a Starship Creator , I would recommend buying the Star Trek Starship Creator Deluxe which allows the player to create 10 federation ships whereas Starship Creator Warp 2 allows only 6 federation ships and the additional one Klingon B'rel . On a plus side , Warp 2 allows the player to export their designed ships of Akira , Galaxy , and Defiant into Star Trek DS9 Dominon Wars multiplayer mode for gameplay online . However the Galaxy class starships that are exported into the Dominon Wars Game turns out to be invisible ( A really big bug/glitch ! ! ! ) Some ships appear to not have been modified at all during exporting - such as Akira class ships and they appear to be discolored ( example : Engines powered down , and lights on the ship are off even during combat ) .Gameplay = 3/10Graphics = 2/10Sound = 2/10Value = 3/10	-1
okay the graphics are stunning and about as good as the humble ps1 is going to get but I 've got quite a few criticisms of this game so here goes:1 ) Its hard to know what you 're supposed to be doing half of the time so a lot of the gameplay is spent running around doing nothing.2 ) The combat is ok , but it can be VERY annoying a lot of the time due to the 'affinities ' of weapons and the 'risk ' system.3 ) Weapons and affinities are a good idea , but the way they are implemented is dreadful . I found it infuriating.4 ) The weapon creation system is appaling and it is almost impossible to find a combination that does anything . And when it does there is no way of checking so it ends up just as a ( bad ) time wasting issue.5 ) The story is okay but its hard to get a feel for the characters and get involved with the story as in mgs and ff games.Overall , I would n't buy this game ( ... ) .	-1
I never got to far playing this game . Up to the first save and after that I 'm stuck and ca n't proceed in the game . So I really did n't like this game .	-1
I ca n't believe Square Soft put out a game with game play and a storyline as lame as Vagrant Story . The battle commands are unwieldy and time-consuming , and the dialog balloons are rather childish and distracting . Granted , some of the effects and characters are neat , but I have to say the best thing about this game was the opening sequence . After that , it 's a disappointment for experienced gamers . I played the game for about three hours until I could n't stand it anymore , thinking I would get used to it , but I just did n't like it .	-1
Really ? I do n't understand why some one would buy this . The PS2 is n't going to get any more stable with the help of it ( and is pretty stable without it ) and all it does is put a blue plastic bar in front of the ps2 . It 's a waste of money unless you want a blue plastic bar in front of your ps2 ( I do n't see the point but if you think it 'll make your ps2 look better I guess that could be worth buying ) . But if you are buying it cause you think it will be functional for anything ... um ... sorry , there 's nothign it really does ( The vertical stand at least offers a little more stability ) .	-1
I believe it was P.T . Barnum who said `` There 's a sucker born every minute . '' If Barnum knew anything about Sony 's vertical and horizontal stands for the PS2 , he would have added , `` And that sucker shells out 10-15 bucks for useless plastic.I 'm sure Sony had some reasoning ( other than money ) to create and market this thing . The carpeting thing as many people mentioned is one , but I do n't see why anyone would do that in the first place . I think it even says in the PS2 instructions not to place it on carpet . And I know that it 's not for stability ( though the title of my review may be poking fun at it ) , but this thing is all around useless.Look at the features : Air circulation ? Raises the gaming unit ? STABILIZES ? ! ? ! Sleek design and looks cool . Whatever . Wan na know how to get around this ? Circulation - do n't put your PS2 on carpet , under water , buried in dirt , or anywhere near your little brother 's Pokemon toys . Raises the gaming unit - try putting it up on blocks as one reviewer suggested , or if you like get a car jack and just raise the thing and lower it to your preference . Stabilizes - I could go into a fifteen paragraph tangent about that one but I wont . You all know what I would say . Sleek design and looks cool - if you 're worried about your PS2 's looks , you probably have more issues than a horizontal stand can fix . And if you 're that concerned , the PS2 will always look `` cooler '' than that purple toaster oven-shaped mini-disk playing Game Cube . No offense to Nintendo.I reviewed the vertical stand too , and I basically said the same thing . I do n't own either , and I have no plans to buy them . I think it 's just a way for Sony to rip people off . No other game system needs something like this , and I 'm sure the next generation Playstation wont need it either.Uh-oh , got ta go . I put my PS2 in the horizontal position and it 's starting to teeter . AGH ! It 's falling right toward my Metal Gear Solid 2 game ! !	-1
Everyone keeps reviewing PS2 in general , and it 's completely irrelevant . This is a NEW version . So let me review the one I got.This is the new smaller design , a little bigger than a DVD case . While it may look cool , it is NOT recommended . The only pro is how cool it looks.The CONS : Will accept PS1 Memory cards and old PS2 Memory cards BUT will not let you use them until you reformat them . This means if you wanted to continue that game you had saved on there , DO N'T COUNT ON IT.The door for the game tray is a flip up instead of a drawer . You 'd think they 'd have learned not to go back to this since their last design failed so frequently with this function.The only reason you should get this Playstation is if : A - You have never owned a Playstation beforeB - You have no friends that own Playstations ( so you wo n't have to worry about bringing games over eachothers places , or showing your pal where you are on the game via his Playstation ) C - You do n't intend on playing your old games on the new system , in any way shape or form . ( Except by starting at the beginning and replaying the game all over again ) .Maybe I seem a little bitter , but my main grudge is that I just got home from playing a game I started at a friends house , put 4 hours of work into , then brought home . Then I popped the memory card in , played for another 4 hours ( all the while , saving and having the playstation tell me it saved successfully ) .. when I realized that the game I was `` overwriting '' was actually the same game over and over . It never overwrote anything . So now , when I turn off my playstation , there goes 4 hours of work.And what happens when I put in the NEW PS2 Formatted Memory card to see if I can save on that ? oh HELL NO . Ofcourse not , it wo n't even recognize the memory card while the game is still in.Thanks a lot Playstation . Atleast if my new XBox screws up , I can save it to the hard drive . Jerks .	-1
I 've been a fan of Sony 's gaming machines since the debut of the PS1 all those years ago.When my big old box of a PS2 ( one of the first to come out , mind you ) up and died in November my heart was broken . But , thankfully , the PSTwo 's were coming out the same day . What a great coincidence ! I ran out and bought one.Flash forward four months . Here I sit staring at the now-dead PSTwo . She will no longer play any games or DVDs , giving instead the dreaded `` The Disk Could Not Be Read '' error ( modified up from the old `` Disk Read Error '' message -- thanks , SONY ! ) . Lens cleaners have failed and there 's no little white wheel inside that a felt tip marker and some internet help can adjust ( as was the case in the older models ) . Did it overheat ? She gave off a nasty smell..and it 's known that the PSTwos get very warm to the touch , despite being loaded up with heat sinks and yes , even a little fan that does a great job blowing the already scorching hot air on to critical parts . Was it just an unlucky , bad unit ? Did it have something to do with Sony 's rumored use of cheap parts ? Do these new units have some inherent design flaw which results in a very short and terminal lifetime ? I do n't know . You decide ... just keep this in mind before you plop down a hundred and fifty bucks . The PS2 is still the best console with the best selection ... buy criminey ! Whatever happened to the days when you 'd buy a product and it *wouldn't* fall apart after a few months ? ? Happy gaming ...	-1
Sony did just fine with original PS2 . Sure its graphics are n't nearly as good as Xbox , or have a hard drive like the Xbox , but it has way more games , and allot of them are really fun . Instead of optimizing the HDD , Sony has cut it out . It made the system quiter , but reduced the size of the fan-which equalls more disk errors and game freezes and it happens faster than ever . This system is completely pointless and insufficient compared to the original PS2 . I love Playstation , but I cant give this system praise like all the other PS2 fans out there because it was made by Sony . Here is how it is-Xbox is a much better system , PS2 has many more fun games to play . Put the two together and it would be impressive at least . I suggest anyone looking to buy the new PStwo to spend the extra $ 40 and get the original , or an Xbox . If you want to buy a present for your kids , this flimsy toy thing will be smashed within a month , waste of money and time .	-1
Sony deletes the functionality of the hard drive upgrade and calls this an improved design . I beg to differ ! Find the original full sized model unless you plan on putting this in your car or live in a very small box or van `` down by the river ! ''	-1
I wish I had done my homework before purchasing this system . It has half the ram of an regular xbox console . Game performance was slow . Navigating was slow . Size is great . It will fit anywhere .	-1
I dont see the point in this remake . For one thing the disc drive is now toploading so if people would buy this becuse they dont have much space in their cabinet can forget it . For example if you had slipped it into a small space you would have to remove it when you want to put a game in . Althought this is slim and great looking i dont reccomend it . What has annoyed me about sony is that the more popular the playstation gets the quality gets worse because they think that it is so popular that it wont matter . I own a ps2 ( fat ) a gamecube and a x-box . out of the 3 the x-box is the best then ps2 then gamecube ( purely because of the amount of games ) My ps2 was given to me about a year ago and it was one of the first ps2s made because my cousin bought it on the launch date . I havnt had any problems with it at all but most of my friends who own ps2s have had something go wrong with them . I think that the more popular ps2 gets the cheaper sony makes them for so they break more . I reccomend the fat ps2 because it has sliding disc tray and iy is sooooo better . One of my friends has the slim ps2 and it is tiny , About the size of a ps2 game case . But the disc toploader feels flimsy and when you open it it is not a smooth action . If you have buy a ps2 buy a fat one because they are the best in my opinion but buy an x-box because they are the best or just buy an x-box .	-1
Although the PS2 was the leader of the last wave of consoles it was the least appealing in graphics and game play . I personally would suggest the Xbox if your into features like a internal hard drive with out memory cards , crisp graphics , custom sound tacks , online play out of the box , responsive analogs and controls , or the Nintendo game cube if controls , children 's games , and even easier game play matter to you more . I would not recommend this to any one unless they have a soft spot for the controller which is comfortable but when it comes to game play it is the least responsive or if you really like kids RPG 's or final fantasy games . The DVD player is an awesome feature but too beware of over heating on the smaller model but this is a very rare problem . Personally I think it has always been over priced . If you notice it is still the same price as the Xbox , which has greater features , or the game cube that has better graphics and better first party games . Now I did point out allot of negatives about the system but it really is the least impressive when it come to actual games . What is impressive is the amount of games in the library . I say age will play a factor . Online is available only on the larger version of the console .	-1
I loved the size of the new PSTwo , but it is still overpriced . You can buy an Xbox for this price . Even though the Xbox is larger , it has a more powerful processor and comes with a harddrive so you do n't need to shell out even more money for memory cards such as playstations require . True playstation has a larger number of games , but xbox has many high quality games coming out in the next few months . Such as Fable , Halo 2 , MechAssault 2 : Lone wolf ect.Pros.1 . Small size and portable2 . Large game selection from PS1 and PS2 titlesCons.1 . Priced as much as an Xbox ( When this hits $ 100 dollars next year I will be first in line to buy it. ) 2 . Games graphically challenged compared to xbox3 . More money for memory cards including special memory cards for PS1 game saves.Sony , take a hint and reduce the price of PSTwo or bundle it with memory cards , two controllers , and a game for this price .	-1
I bought a mini PS2 and was fashioned with it , it looked amazingly it was fantastic , until with a friend we realized the most interesting lie of our lifes , we discovered that this new PS2 has a lot of problems that the old PS2 block will never have . I traded 1 week after that the new Mini PS2 for an old Block PS2 with a hardly very difficult problem , cause they didnt want to get it.The Mini PS2 has a lot of problems , first the lector lens is more at the open air , you can see if when you open the top part of the PS2 , while the Big Block PS2 lector lens wont be seen , unless you open it . This makes the lens more weaker and it can get dirty more easily than the big PS2 lens.Second the power source for the Mini PS2 is attached just next to it , while you are playing over an hour long the PS2 will overheat more than normal and it can get damage for that , even the lens can get overheated . Instead the old Big PS2 had a separate power source , so that it wont overheat the PS2 nor the lens.Thrid the new Mini PS2 is more fragile , so if you drop it , it will break even if you drop it to the ground from 1 feet above the ground it can break or get damage . Instead the old block PS2 can resist all hard handles ... so you just care it and mess with it.To be honest , I prefer my new Old Big Block PS2 . I been rude to that and it wont let me down , so if you need to choose , pick up the Big Block PS2 . ITS WAY BETTER ! UPDATE : Okay I just got an update for you guys , there is a reasonable amount of Mini PS2s that are getting damage between the first 6 and 12 months , I have had friends that regreted trading or selling their old PS2 for the Mini one ... as it wont last long , it will break , overheat or get burned ! HA what do you think about it ?	-1
i loved the original playstation , like everyone else . it was a great platform and had all the great games . but in my opinion , the playstation 2 has been a total bust . average-at-best games , hardware problems ( i had to send in my first ps2 for repairs because it decided it did n't need to read discs anymore . then it decided to start grinding circular ruts in my discs . i finally had to take a $ 70 loss and trade that POS in for a new one ) . the psp is getting dominated by the nintendo ds , in games and in console sales . the ps3 is going to lose tons of market share to the xbox 360 , because the former new kid on the block microsoft is a veteran now and knows what it has to do to cream sony . sony makes problem ridden hardware and is struggling . sony online is known for the worst mmo support ever ( witness their totally inept and bungling mismanagement of a solid gold franchise in star wars galaxies ) . if it was n't for the japanese mafia-style interwoven companies sony would have found itself shut out quite a while ago . the japan that can say no ? how about the usa that will say no to sony when the xbox 360 comes out and the nintendo ds continues to crush the psp . the playstation 2 will be the last sony product i ever buy ... i wish i would have had the foresight to buy an xbox instead of the ps2 , it had better exclusive games ( ninja gaiden , halo , jade empire , etc . ) and was a more powerful and smoother system . sony= the new sega ...	-1
Should n't Sony be focusing on the PS2 ? Since they are diverting their resources to the PSTwo , the PS2 must be throwing in the towel .	-1
I GOT A PS2 AND I ONLY HAD IT FOR ONE YEAR AND BROKE . THEN , I GOT A REFUND AND BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE AND THAT BROKE WITHIN A YEAR TO ! ! ! SO THATS WHY I DIDNT BUY ANOTHER ONE BECAUSE I KNEW IT WOULD BRAKE IN A YEAR TO . I DONT KNOW WHY IT STOPED WORKING THE STUPID PICE OF CRAP KEEPS SAYING ERROR READING DISC AND NONE OF MY PS2 GAMES WERE SCRATCHED UP ! ! ! ! SO DONT BUY IT ! ! ! !	-1
In my country I could buy a console with a higher number ( modern ) , but you send me one a little OLD . So , this console get burn ! ! ! . I did not return this item because is very expensive for me , I live in Costa Rica .	-1
Sony failed to consider one thing for this redesign ... ..A FAN ! ! ! ! I had to replace my original PS2 , which finally died after about 5 years of abuse . It took me forever to find one of the `` newer , slimmer '' PS2 consoles . I did manage to buy one , and within 2 days of use , it died . I took the stupid thing back for an exchange , but the EB Games where I bought it was out , so I got a refund . ( Great customer service by EB Games , by the way . ) I got to talking to the girl that was working there , and she said that these have been recalled because they have been overheating . The fan that they put in it is just way too small to handle the heat generated by the unit , and the design is too small to allow proper heat dispersion . Apparently Sony is being very hush-hush about the recall , but now I know why I could n't find a single one at Best Buy , Circuit City , Wal-Mart , Target , HH Gregg , or K-Mart . I was driving around all of Northeast Ohio for a day , getting more and more curious as to why none of these stores had any . I did n't think it was because they were super-popular , and it seems as though it certainly was n't that . Way to go , Sony - Unleashing a redesigned piece of crap instead of just investing the time and dollars into developing the PS3 . Dummies .	-1
Xbox is for the serious gamers . If you like crappy graphics , horrible online play , and little kid games like Rachet and Clink , Spongebob Squarepants , and Crash Bandicoot then my all means buy the Chumpstation . If you are a serious gamer and like your unit with its own memory that you can download music to , online play that is insane , amazing graphics , more serious and adult games like Halo and Mechassualt then buy the XboxChumpstation 2 - Ages 4 - 9 yrs oldXbox - Ages 10 and over	-1
I unwittingly bought a PS2 , not knowing that I 'd get a god awfull small game controller . I used it for a month and now I ca n't hardly move my hands or my fingers . Do n't buy Playstation 2 . They 've ruined my future . I 'm writing this review right now by using a voice typing program that Microsoft published especially for people who 've ended up in my poor situation .	-1
Due to the fact that there are many reviews for gamecube that say that it sucks are are obviously written by people have no idea what they 're talking about , I will write my own review for ps2 that reflects the 'tards that write for GCN : asthis saystem is really suckyd i have horriblesd gframmer and ca n't typesr worth craap . Anywaqys , , insteasd of syaying anytghinmg important , i willl just saty that PS2 SUXXX abnda get a gamecube . Bnow all you crappy reviewesirs kn ow what o fee ; l laikieAnyways , that 's it . The disgustingly sad part is the fact that tons of these reviews get placed on amazon and no matter how often I report them , nothing happens . Welcome to my sad little world .	-1
this game is so badd i dont even want to talk about it one thing to say is the car control is horrible . whats a racing game with no car control . sega how could you let this one out of the door.AAAAAARRRRRRRHHHHHHGGGGGG ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
My biggest complaint about this game is the totally abysmal mouse movement . I found myself wanting to throw it at the screen , so lousy is the navigation . This game is the winner of the worst navigation plan ever conceived . I give it the Golden Blind Mice Award , only given to games that can not figure out how to illustrate to the player any visual clues to where they are supposed to go without a cane . Even with one , you will be `` tapping '' your mouse so frequently without any results that you might as well put on tap shoes and dance across the keyboard waiting for something to happen . The PDA console takes up too much of the screen , the inventory methods are sloppy . This is an awful game .	-1
This game is so horrible . I loved the movies but this game is just horrible . It 's not even worth a penny plus free shipping ! Some of the atrocious things are the jumps , you ca n't jump over anything but you can jump even though you will never make it over anything . LJN just decided to put Marty McFly in a game and one of your weapons is throwing bowling balls ! ? When did Marty go around throwing bowling balls at people in the movie ? Just stay away from this game at all costs .	-1
LJN has a bad reputation of medicore or terrible games but they made some decent or good games but this is one of their worst yet to come.Loosely based on the 1985 masterpiece `` Back to the Future '' , it seems your in Hill Valley 1955 as you must try everything to collect clocks to save the time and your life from being erased from existence.In this game everything is out to get you from bullies , girls with hula-hoops , men with glass plates , bees and darts . Here Marty is all dressed up in black like a punk instead of wearing his red jacket like in the movies and the music in this game loops over and over again like it makes you a bit crazy . There 's some good things in the game that help fight enemies such as bowling balls you can use to throw at them and bad things like the skateboard which makes you go fast but you ca n't stop as this game goes in a bit of `` Paperboy '' -esque route of racing . There 's even some hard mini-games which is a breath of air from the horrible music playing such as the hit the bullies game which you have to kill 60 of them with milkshakes , a game where you have to avoid being seen by Marty 's past mother and the hardest one where you play at the high school prom.All in all , it 's a real piece of junk from LJN that should be avoided even if you are a fan of the movies .	-1
This game has nothing to do with the movie . The only thing famileur is the logo and the clock tower that arnt anything more then the start screens.You run through the streets and have to collect a bunch of clocks while avoiding running into the hooler hoops girls and killer bee 's and the ever so deadly park bench.This game has nothing to do with the movie at all . It 's more like a run and dodge 'em game like Frogger only on a scrolling screen that seem 's to go absolutly no where.The next game was a little better , but still only 1 stars , but least that game had the deloreon in it .	-1
Back to the Future is one of the more popular movie franchises in ... the movie industry . The game based off of the movie ... ..was a bombshell . It is n't even based off of the movie , since there 's barely anything that relates to it.You play as a guy who 's supposed to be Marty , but does n't look like him . You walk through streets , collecting clocks and shooting bowling balls . That already sounds nothing like the movie . The music is as annoying as the game itself . It loops until you turn off the game.There is this one scene , however , where you play the guitar ( In an awkward way ) , and different music plays . However , it 's not Johnny Be Good . Instead , it 's a garbled 8-bit mess.Could the game be any stupider ? Yes , it can .	-1
Even if this game costs a quarter , stay away ! ! NES produces crappy games from exciting movies on purpose and LJN is guilty for that ! Its a cruel marketing tool to get kids to spend their hard earn money on crappy games ! I played it once on a website that allows you to play NES games and boy the controls suck ! Its horrible ! ! Why ? I 'll tell you ! -1 When did Marty sport a black shirt ? It would'nt hurt if these game developers make it red ! -2 Creativity is horrible ! Throwing milkshakes at bullies , dodging hulla hoop girls , park benches , bumble bees , clumsy moving crews holding pieces of glass ( that you ca n't see until you knock into them ) ... ... .what more can I say ! ! What kind of deadline was LJN tryin to reach ! No excuse ! ! -3 Graphics were horrible ( even for 1989 NES game ) ! -4 Music score was horrible ( same song loops over and over and it was'nt even in the movie ) -5 Overhead view of game in play gives me a headace and jump button is worthless if you ca n't jump over anything ! Like I said , controls are akward ! -6 Ending is short and it sucks ! After all that work , trying to beat this difficult and horrible game , you get a crappy ending . Many LJN games for NES have these so beware ! Do n't buy this game ! ! Also , stay away from the `` Mario Bros '' rip off sequel ( II and III ) !	-1
Do you like Paperboy , but hate the part of the game where you have to play as a paperboy ? Then Back to the Future is the game for you ! Forget about a story line . You start as some guy ( I assume Marty ? ) running down the street . You have to dodge hoola-hooping women , charging beefcake men , and bees ( or maybe humming birds ) . Just like in the movie , you can grab a bowling ball and shoot these obstacles before they hit you ! Occasionally you 'll have a chance to grab a skateboard , but that just makes you crash quicker . Can you make it to the end of the block before 200 seconds runs out ? The only thing in the game that kinda ties it to the movie is a picture of Marty , his brother and his sister on the bottom of the screen , which fades away as time passes . Of course , I only know this because I 've seen the movie , and it really looks more like a picture of George Washington , Jack White and Nosferatu with a bad toupe ( now that 'd be a great game ! ) . You have to grab alarm clocks to keep it from fading , which makes perfect sense.Let 's say you make it through the five or so levels like this , which are all pretty much the same ... It 'll get you to Lou 's Cafe ( hey , something from the movie ! ) , but that 's when it gets even weirder . & # 34 ; Bullies to go ! & # 34 ; it says as Marty walks in . He grabs someone from behind the counter and slides her down to the end of the room . Then it says & # 34 ; Boy , they sure threw you out in a hurry ! & # 34 ; and you have to replay the last street level . Once you beat it , this happens again ! And each time , you lose a life until it 's game over ! Is it even possible to make it past this part of the game ? After several attempts , I 've concluded that no , it is not possible.If you want to flash back to a time when video games made no sense and slapped any random movie title on a cartridge so that it 'd sell , then this is the game for you ! But if you 're looking for anything that has to do with Back to the Future - music , characters , story , a DeLorean - then you 've come to the wrong place.But of course , 1985 was a simpler time , where video games were usually one or two impossible levels that created endless frustration ... and we liked it that way !	-1
This NES game is nothing like the movie . You ride a skateboard through a street and dodge very deadly objects , such as soda cans , bannana peels , kidney beans , etc.. That 's it ... the whole game is you on a skateboard , a side-scrolling screen , trying to avoid objects being thrown at you . Why are objects flying at you ? who the -- -- knows ? ? ? ?	-1
this is another tough gane not too exciting but my nephew likes it so I gave it to him.I wish the graphics were more like the nes bataman	-1
I usually raise a few eyebrows among fellow NES enthusiasts when I reveal that I do not have this game in my library . The truth is that I would n't have it in my house.On its face , it looks like a great game . I enjoyed the graphics and sound the first time I fired it up years ago . The story was fun and silly , and there was plenty of humor in the level design & characters ' super-hits . Then I reached the third level , and the difficulty just shot through the roof . Perhaps the most telling event was when I attempted to leap the first of the lava pits . I lined myself up at the edge of the platform , leapt ... and passed right through the far bank . I lost several lives before I realized you have to line yourself up in the MIDDLE of the platform , a substantial distance back . The game is loaded with counterintuitive occurences like this one.I reached the conclusion that Battletoads is n't really a game . It 's a sequence of button-presses you must execute in a specific order . You do n't PLAY Battletoads , you memorize the sequences , much like those Sega CD games where you just match the on-screen controller directions while stuff happens in the background . For example , the speeder-bike level is actually harder if you look at the screen . The best way to play it is to make notes on where the walls appear and look at those , with only occasional glances at the screen to check your position . Worst of all , there are a limited amount of continues , which is completely unforgiveable in a game demanding so much trial and error . Subsequent levels are worse , the Snake Pit being my least favorite.I think I only ever beat the speeder-bike level once as a child , then died within seconds of beginning the following ice cavern . And I 'm a player who can beat Contra with one life . I went back years later and beat the game using an emulator to save states , and you know what ? I still did n't enjoy it . It 's just not a very good game . I prefer to look at the screen when I play .	-1
Battletoads2 Stars - So much potential , but the difficulty really prevents most players from getting very farAh yes , `` Battletoads '' . In gaming culture , this game is home to one of THOSE levels . You know , the kind that appeared impossible when you first played it , and then . . . after a broken controller and lots and lots of swear words and three hours later STILL appears impossible.Then you YouTube the level , and like watching someone play Eddie Van Halen 's Guitar Instrumental `` Eruption '' , you see someone pass the level with ( oh God ) apparent ease ! These players must be cheating ! There are lots of levels like this in the NES catalogue . `` Adventure Island '' 8-3 . `` Ninja Gaiden '' 6-2 and then the end bosses . `` The Legend of Zelda '' Dungeon Six . The Dam level on `` Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles '' . ( At least with TMNT at least the title of the level makes you feel like you 're swearing which is probably pretty cool when you 're twelve ) . Pretty much the ENTIRETY of the nightmare that is `` Ghost and Goblins '' . Also `` Silver Surfer '' .Of course the level I am referring too is the speed bike level , which is the third one early on in the game . `` Battletoads '' is one of those games that Tradewest , the developer , had crafted in hopes of turning into a TMNT type franchise . Colorful characters , over the top villians ( in this case a Darak Queen ) , and anthromorphic toads . For early 1990s the concept fit right into popular culture.There 's only one problem . The game is hard . As hell.Yes , you want challenges . But honestly , so many people stop at level 3 because they ca n't get past the friggin ' stage . And this was a game marketed for kids . By the time you give up you 're so beat and humiliated you do n't want to see another battle toad as long as you live . It 's kind of hard to feel connected to a franchise when you ca n't even get past the third level.What is so unfortunate is that beyond Level Three there are some intrinsically intriguing , well designed game play ( the Surf level , the Elevator Shaft , the Dark Queen 's Tower ) . Unfortunately most people never saw that game play . Then there is the Snake level , which is almost as insane as the speeder bike level . Of course , there is a SECOND speeder bike level , and this time the stones you crash into are MOBILE ! An earlier reviewer said that `` Battletoads '' is n't a game , it 's a sequence of memorized button sequences . While that could be argued for a lot of games , it gets to the heart of the main problem with `` Battletoads '' . For a game primarily marketed for kids , the game is simply too difficult for its main audience , and for most other players as well . Of course , TMNT had similiar difficulty issues , but that was already established.Another rather famous attribute to this game is the co-op game play . Although Nintendo has said in recent `` Iwata Asks '' interviews that they have been trying to get co-op gameplay in `` Super Mario '' titles since 1988 with `` Super Mario Bros. 3 '' , other developers were able to get co-op play without issue ( this game , `` Contra '' ) . However , given how frustratingly difficult this game is , there is a gamebreaking bug which if you get to the Dark Queen 's Tower with two players ( which is highly improbable to begin with - you think the Speeder Bike level is hard with ONE player ? Try TWO ! ) , apparently there is a game breaking bug that completely freezes the game . That would be so rage inducing I 'd probably just throw the NES out the window.Tradewest who owned both franschises did a cross over title , having the `` Battletoads '' team up with `` Double Dragon '' , another legendary video game franchise with the 1993 title `` Battletoads & Double Dragon '' . Although Tradewest owned the `` Double Dragon '' franchise back in the early 1990s they have since sold the tile.. Although a genuine cross over , the focus is largely on the `` Battletoads '' franchise . There are also some inconsistencies between the `` Double Dragon '' canon proper and this title . The game is also very difficult , just like the original `` Battletoads '' , though thankfully there are no God-awful speeder stages or snake stages this time around.Overall , decent game that is marred by its most famous attribute : its difficulty . And the fact the difficult stages come so early on , it prevents most players from really seeing what the rest of the game has too offer.The video game website IGN rated this title as the 76th greatest game on their top 100 NES games of all time . ( For those looking for great unknown NES/Famicom games , you simply MUST play `` Moon Crystal '' , a criminally unknown Famicom exclusive . The graphics are astounding with cutscenes that even outdo `` Ninja Gaiden '' , amazing music , in depth gameplay , and a fantastic storyline . Absolutely amazing ! Had this been released in the US for the NES , I feel it would be as revered as the other heavy hitters in the NES canon )	-1
I have bought two of these with the standard ( new ) buy button , and both cases were eerily similar.I ordered this , expecting to get an original NES controller or at least a tolerable 3rd party controller . The NES knock-off controller that comes in the box looks fine at first glance . Pretty much indistinguishable from the real thing , visually , except a QC sticker on the back and the red-lettered Nintendo above the two face buttons is gone . However , when you pick up the controller , you start seeing the problem.The first thing you 'll notice is that the paddle is heinously lightweight . It 's paper-light . If you put this down with any tension in the wire , or if you accidentally touch the wire , the controller will shoot like a rocket towards the console / floor . And you will be accidentally hitting the wire often , because the wire is several feet shorter than the original controller . That means you 'll have to get creative on where you place it - no stashing it next to the TV , it 's gon na have to stay near the console . And you are , too , while you 're playing.Now I can tolerate how it handles out of play just fine if it plays well . But this is where the generic is just shameful . The original NES controller had a very reasonable roll to the control pad , and some respectable size tolerances on the face buttons . The control pad , for starters , is way too sensitive on the diagonals . You can not play Contra with this controller , because you will accidentally get up from the prone position with bullets at standing-chest-level on a regular basis . And it 's just flat out uncomfortable anyways , being a very hard plastic that has a very sudden & # 34 ; give & # 34 ; to it , as opposed to the original , which was more gradual about the downpress motion . The start and select buttons are plastic instead of that rubberlike material , which makes them clicky and feel far less pleasant than the originals ( I wonder if it 'd be nice to have all the face buttons be rubber ... ) . The red face buttons are loosely moulded and wobble quite fiercely , but besides the obnoxious rattling wo n't present any gameplay issues.It 's a terrible controller , only good if you need to have a quick Nintendo fix on a left-or-right only game and you just ca n't stand the thought of buying used . Otherwise , pass on it .	-1
This is just a Tomee controller . When I first plugged it in to play the d-pad almost was completely unusable . After taking the controller apart and cleaning it a little bit , it started to work a little bit better .	-1
OK the NES controller is a good controller just do n't buy it off amazon . You can get it cheaper at your local video game store or Ebay . Also you do n't have to wait for shipping trust me staring at a NES knowing you ca n't play it is painful .	-1
... only a little more advanced.You do have a lifebar , but it depleets very quickly.Lots of high jumping enimies that throw stars and slash at you.The only thing I really liked about this game was the music during the levels.Only pay $ 3- $ 5 maximum for this.The game reviewer `` a zz '' who gave it five stars in a one sentence review and posted it twice was just trying to be funny.This game is pretty terrible and he 's an idiot .	-1
This game has NOTHING to do with the epic looking cover label art . It is like this weird samurai ninja game where you can jump impossibley ( if thats a word ) high and kill monsters with a sword that is about the size of a butter knife.Dont play this is a horrible 3rd party game and a complete waste of money .	-1
That 's right , folks ! This is another beat-up-the-bad-guys-and-save-the-girl video game from the makers of . . . actually Technos made this game . I know next to nothing about Technos . Double Dragon is a game of three distinct trigger actions : jumping , punching , and kicking ; and seeing as how the standard NES controller has only two trigger buttons , Tehcnos decided in part 3 ( as with the previous games ) to make jumping accessible by through pressing the both the punch and kick buttons simultaneously ( there is lenience so both buttons do not need to be pressed at the exact same time ) . From a jump , you can perform one of three attacks as Billy or Jimmy : cyclone spin-kick ( A or B ) , arial kick ( left or right and B ) , or monkey-flip your opponent ( left or right and A ) . When monkey-flipping your opponent , you somersaut over your opponent , grab his/her head or hair , and toss him/her through the air . This is especially fun when fighting on ledges -- just make sure you do n't get too close and fall off , yourself.On the downside , there are no playable females ( which seems to bother only myself ) . You can still fight against a few female thugs though.Another hex is the high level of difficulty that stems from the questionable play-control . For example , the first boss ( who somehwat resembles the Jack of Hearts ) has a long reach which makes him hard to hit and he often ducks when you try to whack him with your cyclone spin-kick , leaving you open for attack , thanks to a lagging recovery . You also can not monkey-flip some enemies.As for Chin and Ranzou , these two have slightly different attack methods from the Double Dragons : Chin has a diving Kamikaze head-butt which is activated through jumping towards your an enemy and then pressing A . When your press A or B after jumping , he does some weird air dance that only attacks from one side . His weapon is the iron claw , similar to Vega from Street Fighter.Yagu Ranzou is ( in my opinion ) the best character . He uses a katana instead of his bare fists and he can use his other weapon 20 times ( as opposed to Chin and the Lee brothers who can only use their 's five ) . Ranzou 's weapon is the shuriken ( or flying ninja star ) .You can play as Chin and Ranzou only after you have beaten them.Billy and Jimmy 's weapons are the nunchukues.Note : in case you buy this game used and without an instruction manual , you need to hold the Select button for two or three seconds during gameplay to activate the options menu for using your weapon and/or changing characters . Have fun .	-1
Join Billy and Jimmy in a similtaneous brawling on the streets game . This is the same game as ever , just with less graphics . They tried to incorporate a new idea to this game by having Billy and Jimmy on a quest around the world to find Billy 's girlfriend Maria . The game gets very old quickly because of how long it is and the lack of enemy variety .	-1
A friend gave me money to order this for him . I personally did n't like this game . It 's the worst in the Double Dragon series .	-1
Out of the 3 NES Double Dragon games , I think those of us who played all 3 and were n't just stuck with owning one of the 3 back in the day would probably overall agree Double Dragon II is the best of the series . Double Dragon 1 was tough , but fine , Double Dragon II was just about perfect , and when we heard DDIII was about to come out , anticipation was at a high to play it.However what most of us found was a game not equal to DDI or II . I think like many at first who played this after the first 2 , wondered why the heck the game was so hard and lacked options to make it easier . Both the original games started off on the street , this one starts in a Dojo ... okay , maybe they wanted to try something new , but it seemed to be wrong from the start . Straight away you start off against 1 opponent , once you beat them you have to go talk to a friend dieing on the side of the screen who tells you he tried to stop the new bad guys , but he could n't , and the main person to beat is ... that 's what it says , `` is ... '' leaving it like a mystery as he dies . I guess that would be fine , but it 's the way its shown ... DD1 has a cut scene of Marian being kidnapped before you play , DDII explains it in the intro that you can skip , but in DDIII you have to wait a few seconds for this on screen dialog/talk to hurry up and finish before you can resume , and that is just an annoying step backwards.Next up you find your moves you got used to from DDI or DDII are again something different . I used to think the only way to improve DDII would be to have included the ground punches and head-butt moves back into the game . Now DDIII has a few familiar moves , but lacks in them . In Double Dragon II you relied a lot on your jumping 360 kick that you could preform from the jumping up or down , or jumping to the left and right , in Double Dragon III you can only perform it by jumping up and down , you can not execute the move jumping in either direction , which is a shame . Also needed was the return of the jumping-power-knee and super-uppercuts from DDII , but they are sorely missed in DDIII ... even the reverse elbow smash from DDI would have been a nice addition.So what has been added to the 3rd one , move wise ? Apart from regular kicks and punches , the only returning move is the jumping 360 kick , which you can not do jumping left or right now . A run feature has been included and a move where you can jump and flip over your opponent , grab their hair and throw them across the screen ... you can also now do a move where if you run at a wall , you can bounce off the wall with a super flying kick , which is a decent move if you can do it.. and there is also a couple of double-team moves for 2 players ; one is a flying kick your partner helps throw you in , and the other is a joined hand dancing spin kick fest that is probably the best move in the game , but can only be done in 2 player mode ... Double Dragon 3 really had lacked in quality from the other Double Dragon games as being a great game on 2 player , or single play.It almost seems like this game was being designed , and new ideas where just not working ; so instead of scrapping the game or improving what flaws it had to be a great game , they released a demo and forgot to tell people to send in their thoughts to help improve the game . Even in the 2 player intro screens , the game says the two heroes are Billy & Bimmy Lee ... Bimmy ? A spelling error like that in a NES game ? Or maybe it is correct , maybe Jimmy Lee refused to be in this sarky game , so ACCLAME asked their retarded cousin Bimmy to be in it instead ? The other thing that bugs me is your enemies are not supposed to be Shadow Warriors from the previous Double Dragons ... then why does Linda , Williams and whatever other enemies make a return ? What makes this game harder from the previous DD games is the lack of options , there simply is n't any . You can make the game even harder by selecting 2 player B and beating up player two so you can solo play against twice as many enemies ... but if you wan na make the game easier , you will need a pro-action-replay or something to help you cheat.The biggest issue with this version is extra lives ... there is n't any ! You get 1 life ... you die , you 're out ! Do not pass go , do not collect 2up hundred dollars ... nope , you 're screwed . If you can manage to beat two other character in the game , some slow and fat ninja guy and a samurai , these guys will become your extra life . You can choose to select these guys by pressing select and choosing them to take over , or if you die as who you are in the game , one of these guys will take over as your main character ... what I do not get is why the heck could n't Jimmy be selectable in a 1 player game as your back up life ? There is a little trick you can do to make that so , what you do is start the game on 2 player B and beat up Jimmy , or should I say , the retarded cousin of the Lee brothers , Bimmy , who accidentally misspells his own name on the game-play screen as Jimmy . Anyway , beat the first baddie , then beat up JimmBimm until your next hit will be the one that kills him . Then position him sort of in the middle of the room in a way that when you perform your jumping spinning 360 kick , he lands on the guy you have to talk to . If done right , Jimmy will activate him talking to you guys , instead of dieing . Then , make sure BillyBobJim does n't die during the battle with the next few bad guys . Once the Dojo enemies are gone , have Jimmy exit the room first , then Billy . When you emerge from the room on the street , Jimmy will be gone , but if you press select , Jimmy is there as your 2nd option of character and your backup life ... . however , do n't use Jimmy till you have reached level two , as he will still have the ready to die energy he had from your beating until it regenerates in level two.Now , as I was saying about the extra guys you can choose . They are useless , what moron thought it would be a good idea to allow you to use two extra characters that are just about useless ? As boss enemies , they are decent , but to play as them is pretty weak , especially if you lose Billy/BimpDaddyJimbo and are stuck playing the rest of the game as one of these losers ... as I did , getting stuck with the Samurai guy to finish the game off and yet somehow the dead Jimmy still gets the glory in the end.So , I have n't said many positive things about the game yet ... one option I do like is your option to swap characters during game play and have a special weapon you can choose to use at any time ... however , unless you know how to rom hack like I did and add Jimmy as your second character by default play , and also have unlimited use of the special weapons ... not to mention invincibility ... then they are more something you have to plan and use strategies for when you are going to use them and how . Using cheats like that was the only way I could beat this game . Maybe you are good enough to do it without using any methods of cheats ... but being someone who can beat Double Dragon II with my eyes closed and then coming into DDIII like someone who dies on the first goomba of Mario Bros , it really pi..cheesed ... me off.Once game play was over and done with , I was not impressed one little bit with the ending of the game . At least the first II Double Dragons showed something that made you feel like you had passed the game.. but this ones text `` where are they now '' screens really do show the lack of thought and imagination put into this game .. '' Billy & BJimmy rode off into the sunset to teach Kung Fu , while FuMan Chu and Tom Cruise become emperors of Kmart discounts '' what kind of ending is that ? No scenes , no decent ending , just a `` what happened to them , bye '' screen . I hate these games that are so hard to beat , and reward you with nothing once it 's over . I suppose it 's not quite nothing , nothing would be a single screen with no pictures saying , `` thanks for playing , sorry you wasted so much time to see this text , bye '' . But this game here may as well have said just that.So I guess that 's why I do n't particularly like DDIII . Not on the NES anyway ... least the Arcade version was pretty decent and even allowed a 3rd player ... but most importantly , had extra lives for as long as you could drop coins into it . And you know what the worse thing about it is ? It 's one of those rare times when you can truly say , even the Sega had a better version the NES . Sure the nes version isnt as bad as the GameGear version , but it 's sad when even the GameBoy has a better version then the NES.I think with the lack of effort put into the game , and it 's terrible reward for beating the game , that is why it is so hard . The game makers do n't want you to be able to beat it , so you can see just how unrewarding it is . At last moment before they decided to release it , like I was saying before about it being a demo ... I really think game testers where thinking that the game is so bad , give people 1 life so they ca n't advance to the end and see just how sh/badly we have made this version , but because DDI & II sold so well , this one is guaranteed to make us a few bucks anyway , so just release it as it is now , no one will see the end of it anyway .	-1
Is it just me , or is this game impossible to play ? Unfortunately my Game Genie went missing about 15 years ago ( and it did n't work in the top-loader anyway ) , so unless everybody else is just straight up better than me ( a possibility ) , they 've got ta be cheating.I was lucky to get out of the first room ( a challenge in itself ) , but even after I started to get a hang of it , I could still barely make my way into the first level . Is there more than one level ? This is supposed to be a long game ? How can anybody possibly know that ? ! ? ! You get one life , and no continues . Yeah , I know , right ? Enemies are tough and repetitive , and if you 're lucky enough to make it on top of the building , they can easily knock you off and send you back to the start screen . Maybe it 's easier with two players , but my second controller must be hidden with the Game Genie.Whatever happened to making games that are fun to play ? Forget about fun ... how about playable ? Let me play for more than ten minutes without screaming in endless frustration . Who are these impossible games made for ? Suckers , I suppose . Chalk me up as one . Stupid Double Dragon ...	-1
Double Dribble is an awful basketball game despite what anybody says . I 've hated it back then , and I hate it today . The controls are pretty choppy , and all the game amounts to : dunk , steal , dunk , and then some . The shooting is impossible to do ; I just have a lot better chance making a dunk than shooting from anywhere else . My teammates are quite useless when it comes to playing defense . The only best part of the game is the dunking scene . But since I do it like every time , it gets really boring . What 's with the halftime show ? The game wo n't let me to skip that , forcing me to watch the dreadful display of cheerleading . All in all , playing Double Dribble is like trying to eat lots of mayonnaise and nothing else .	-1
Have you ever wondered why they did n't do an Uncle Fester spin-off movie where he fights aliens in a neighborhood ? Guess they could n't talk Hollywood into that no-brainer , so it must have gotten bumped down to the video game world . Hopefully Cousin It 's Barber School Adventure is up next ! This is one of those games that makes you wonder about the video game industry back in the day . Would they just greenlight anything that had a semi-recognizable name on it ? Apparently yes . Or at least they 'd take some crappy game and slap a name on it , because this clearly has no ties to the world of The Adams Family beyond the title.But let 's put the story flaws aside and focus on the fact that the game is impossible to play . Fester only gets two life bars , which go fast when his laser gun ( he has a laser gun ) proves relatively ineffective on the aliens . You can shoot the non-moving ones four or five times to get an item , but even with upgrades I was unable to kill the jumping aliens ( which look suspiciously like the Legend of Zelda jumping creatures ) . Each venture into the world lasted a minute or two , and once you die the game is over and you start again.Pressing pause only brings up further questions . You can select between a gun and a whip for a weapon , but I could n't figure out how to change it . There are various items you can collect , including keys and money , but I never got anywhere that they could be used.As far as I can tell , this game is impossible to play ... forget about playing through to the end , because even surviving five minutes seems like a grand achievement . Does Fester even have a quest beyond survival ? This game ranks up there with Back to the Future and Karate Kid as one of the worst movie tie-ins ever . I mean , come on !	-1
I had the misfortune of getting this game back at the end 1989 for my NES . At that time , I also owned an Atari 800XL with Ultima III : Exodus and Ultima IV : Quest of the Avatar , which are really enchanting RPG , if you do n't mind the crude graphics , so I was hoping Hydlide would be another Ultima , but boy was I wrong . Let 's get with the music : it 's some of the worst video game music I have ever heard ! Cheap ripoff of the Indiana Jones theme song which keeps repeating itself over and over every 15 seconds . I never wanted to play this game unless the volume was turned off because the music will get on your nerves in no time flat . This & quot ; music & quot ; ( which I refuse to think of as music ) sounds like the worst garbage you 'd hear from a music box . The graphics are very crude looking , and even for the 8-bit NES capability , it 's really horrible ( the graphics of Bionic Commando is miles better than this garbage ) . Heck , even the old Atari 8-bit adapation of the Ultima series looks better . How about playability ? Well you have to run in to slimes and other monsters and press the A button to try to destroy them , but more chances than not , you 'll end up killed . Often if you stand in the wrong vegetation , or you stand in the cemetary , your hit points drain without even monsters touching you ( until you gain enough experience points ) . Basically in this game , you 're supposed to collect all three fairies before you 're able to kill the dragon . It took me ten years to finally win the game . That was in 1999 , I finally won the game because I was finally able to find that third fairy . I did n't realize I was supposed to kill two wizards at once with the wave spell to get that last fairy . Perhaps the worst of this game is when you want to save it . You need to obtain an unnecessiarly long password and write it down . More chances than not you have written the password incorrectly and you pretty much lost what you accomplished in this horrible game . The Ultima series were wonderful , spellbinding RPGs ( as long as you owned the Atari , Apple , or Commodore 64 , rather than the NES or SNES adaptation ) . Hydlide is now regarded as not only the worst fantasy RPG ever made , but one of the worst ever made for NES . I have no idea what the makers of this game were thinking . Perhaps they were trying to cash in on the Legend of Zelda fad of the time and fell horribly flat . I have played much better NES games , including their adaptation of Willow , as well as Shadowgate , which means you are much better off checking out those games than Hydlide , unless you want to see just how bad games can get .	-1
There is a lot to be said about Hydlide , unfortunately all of it is bad . First off , the game breaks the standard that you do n't touch enemies because it hurts you . In this game you hold the A button to change to attack mode and then blindly run into the enemy to hope that you win . If you die you lose everything and start all over from the beginning , and you will die a lot in this game.The sound is horrible , the music is the same seven second loop of a theme that sounds very much like the Indiana Jones theme song.The graphics are okay for the NES I suppose , I ca n't knock those too much since the system was n't that powerful.The save system is misleading and led to a very angry me . In the menu there is an option to save , load and password . I hate passwords and so I just saved and quit . Well the carriage has no internal battery , so the save only works for if it is still on . You have to use the really long password to reload your game . And of course it changes every single time you access the password screen.I have only scratched the surface of the confusion and bad design choices that is Hydlide . If you find a good price and you think you might hate yourself , pick this up and see for yourself . I got my copy for a dollar , and I felt like that was almost too much .	-1
I am appalled at how poorly this game was designed . The story is just lame , and without the instruction booklet or a online FAQ/walkthroughm it is hard to figure out what you 're supposed to do next because of the screwiness . Most games , one can easily figure out how to play it soon enough without a booklet , but this game was just awful . The whole running at enemies bit was just shoddy , and the seemingly random scavenger hunt for items seemed as if it was written by a idiot.The music , terrible . The level-ups , weak . The map/questworld , horrid . The controls ... ugh . I seriously could not bring myself to continue this game , I quit about halfway because I just did n't want to waste my time anymore , not when this game had NOTHING to offer in way of fun or entertainment . This is easily one of the worst video games ever invented .	-1
Although I 'm not too impressed of the cover art of this title , but what I found to be much unimpressive is the horrific gameplay . For those that do n't know , the famous Italian actor name Fabio Lanzoni is the model posing with the sword on the game 's cover like a bad-ass and its a common marketing tool to get kids ' parents ( including a horny middle aged housewife or single mother - lol ) to waste their hard earned money on a mediocre game for their kids . For starters , the character 's ( Kuros ) sword attack is very short range and awkward ( you do n't stand a chance against any melees when neccessary ) . There are other alternative attacks like projectile spells , but they deplete your magic very quickly and they must be conserved for the elemental boss battles of which swifter than lightning strategies are mandatory . Weapon upgrades do n't help as much and you ca n't perform a jump attack which is neccessary for those multiple airborne creatures that must be warded off . The jump configurations are useless and I thought it was me , but its hard to steer while in the air . The game 's music is pleasing and so are the graphics and color schemes . The game 's objectives are simple and to the point - defeating all four elemental guardians who stand in your way to obtain the iron sword you must use to defeat the evil Malkil in the Icefire Mountain . To progress through each level , Kuros must find a golden artifact for each Animal King for each elemental domain and they will help you advance toward the domain so he can find the neccessary magic spells and armor/weapon upgrades ( range of the weapon still sucks ) needed to defeat each Guardians . As I said before the controls are very flawed and adding on the the difficulty is the absent `` after hit '' invisiblity , fast depleting life bar , difficulty in seeing whats ahead before its too late due to the screen 's influent pace , and limited continues . Iron Sword looks like it could 've been a very good game , but due to the mild success of the previous game and the cover art of the game , it misleaded many gamers and kids wasted their money and time on this mediocre title . The game designers are laughing their heads off and collecting their money while many frustrated gamers like myself are biting the controls as early as level 1 because we die from multiple enemy attacks due to the cumbersome controls . The game designers did'nt want to repeat the same formula as simular themed great games like The Legend of Zelda , Gauntlet , and Castlevania , but I think they took three steps back by trying to emulate an average game like Capcom 's Ghosts & Goblins , but they failed . I wasted a good $ 5 on this title and I ca n't take it back .	-1
The Little Mermaid for the GB is a very average game . In this game , you go through sidescrolling levels with some up and down movement . You can use shells to open boxes and kill enemies . There are powerups that you can use to defeat enemies . You use bubbles to trap enemies in the game . It is extremely easy to beat . The graphics are pretty good for a Gameboy game . The sound effects are average with nothing special about them . This is a very mediocre game with nothing special or overly bad about it .	-1
All the Megaman games are way to dawn hard , esspessially MM 6 thats insane . I have played all these and the only one I enjoyed and played alot was Megaman 5 on origional gameboy the rest just pissed me off .	-1
So this is considered the greatest Mega Man game ever . Really ? I mean , REALLY ? No one has the balls to be objective ? I guess not , so I 'll have to do it . Suffering from `` more of the same '' syndrome , Mega Man 2 was little more than a retread of that which made the first Mega Man as irritating as it was , but a bit more playable , focused and inspired in the level structures , bosses and other necessities . Gravity is still a harsh mistress to the Megster and the overall look of the game is still very mid-80s NES dreckish , but it was around this time that the series started to better itself by way of adding a few more elements to the series , namely the 8 boss rule , the various little tools that helps Mega Man traverse hard-to-reach areas , and those blessed E-Tanks . Nevertheless , Mega Man 2 did really nothing more than keep the franchise afloat for another game until things started to REALLY take off ...	-1
Mega Man V is definitely the weakest of all 8 original Mega Man games . It 's so easy that you can beat it with the Mega Buster all the way through . You do n't need any of the weapons because each of the bosses dies very quickly as good ole blue Mega Man . I beat the game within a couple of days [ ... ] .	-1
Hideo Kojima the creator of metal gear was NOT involved in making this version of metal gear ! Check wikipedia if you are doubtful . This game was made by money grubbing game makers.Unlike all other metal gear games this one is n't about trying to be stealthy . It 's an imitation of a run n'shoot type game . I repeat the creator of metal gear was not even involved in this . It 's only metal gear by name .	-1
I laugh when people write that Paperboy is a very difficult game . No , it is n't , but how they played it probably made it too tough to play . For me , I took the wimp route and beat it without a problem . No , it 's not a Game Genie that was used . Listen up , follow this simple strategy , and it will work for you . Notice in the game how you are able to advance to the next day if you have enough white houses . Then ... that 's how you beat the game . Get it ? No ? Ok ... fine . Theoretically and basically , you will advance to the next day if you have at least one white house standing on the route . Pretty much , who cares about the fact that you either make 10 out of 10 perfectly or miss a ton of them ? As long as you make one perfect delivery to a house , you are good to go for the next day . That 's exactly how you should play the game . So , here is my perfect strategy in terms of beating Paperboy : forget about racking up points by throwing tons of papers , forget about throwing papers to every white house in hopes for gaining a house next day unless you have no fear of being run over by an obstacle , focus on making a perfect run avoiding all obstacles along the way without losing a life , and just hit the two of the easiest houses on the route . The game is much , much harder if you juggle through hitting white houses as perfectly as you can , riding the bike in an aligned manner , avoiding obstacles side and front , and picking up newspapers . I pretty much focused on aligning my bike perfectly as I can and just worked on the same two houses every day . I do n't even care about the training course since it does n't affect my lives . I prefer to crash once I am in there , just to save my hands from getting sore . That 's how the game is easy for me to beat . I actually survived the whole thing with one house left ( another one was added on Sunday for a `` perfect '' delivery ) , making the entire game a joke . Even the farewell part was lunatic to observe , seeing how laughably I missed so many houses yet I won . That 's how bad the game is . I know Paperboy has been regarded as a classic back then , but let 's get real ... the game sucks . Anybody can beat it if my simple strategy is followed . Otherwise , tough game and not worth attempting .	-1
they said they tested their games before shipping but when i got the game it wouldnt play . i was so looking forward to playing it too : (	-1
did n't work at all . we tried eighty ways from sunday to get it to play but it would just do a weird little demo .	-1
You play as a sportscar on your way in eight races against cars that all look the same . The play control is really bad as you can only go forward , nor can you even turn around , just move left and right . This was the first racing game for Nintendo , so what do you expect ? There is still big challenge as you cross checkpoints to get more time , which makes the game so challenging , because there is so little time and the races are so tediously long . Another big thrill about the game was it is the first and only game that features 3D ! The game came with 3D glasses and a 3D mode . Even though it never looked at all 3D , which is why this never caught on and no more 3D games were made .	-1
I could not believe how terrible this game was . The controlls are sloppy and the gameplay is horrible . You cant do anything . If you pick up a weapon or something you cant do anything with it . Avoid this game !	-1
This game is so so but the thing that kills it completely is the horrible , stupid controls . Mario seems to have greese on his boots as he always slides of edges and makes crappy jumps to his death no matter what you do . The graphics were pretty good for the time and the game is some what fun for about a half hour before it gets too repeditive to the point where you never want to see it again . Mario 3 is the best one . This game only sold so many copies because it was shipped out with every NES system . Nintendo Entertainment System saved the gaming market not this crappy game .	-1
The game did not work .	-1
Yes it 's a diffrent game with Mario characters yes it 's not the best Mario game . But this game is actually a decent game and it 's actually a fun game in it 's own way it 's not a bad at all in fact the truth is why we got a Doki Doki Panic with Mario characters is cause SMB 2 ( JAP ) is very hard I know I played it on the all stars collection . Nintendo just used this game to tide players over for SMB 3 Nintendo thinking of there bottom line released this instead becuse SMB 2 ( JAP ) would have killed Mario 3 cause they would have thought that SMB 3 was s**t. Not as good as the 1st the 3rd Super Mario World Mario 64 but still it 's a decent Mario game it 's fun too . Maybe underrated maybe .	-1
Super Mario Bros. 2 is absolutely horrible . Super Mario Bros. 3 is a lot better , but it 's a little overrated ... The original Super Mario Bros . Beats them both , easily ! But Super Mario World is near-perfect , making them all seem like nothing . Mario has made a lot of great games in his day , but Super Mario Bros. 2 was a terrible failure . The graphics and sound are bad . The gameplay is n't what you 'd expect from classic Mario games . Picking up enemies instead of stomping on them is too hard to do and takes too long . There are n't a lot of Power-ups , and they 're not good power-ups either . Super Mario Bros. 1 and 3 are great , especially 1 . If you really want to know how bad this piece of junk is , then get this : I ca n't think of A SINGLE good thing to say about Mario 2 ! The best quality in the game is poor quality.Presentation- 38/100Graphics- 49/100Sound- 35/100Gameplay- 15/100Replay Value- 9/100Overall- 23/100	-1
Ok , the original version of SMB 2 was only released on the Famicon which really sucks . This version of the game was a remake of Doki Doki , that is why the story seems really strange for a Mario game.I will reccommend Mario All Stars , if you want to play the original version of this game . At all costs do n't get this Doki Doki crap .	-1
My recollection of this game is that it survived a *very* short time in rotation as the lead Mario property . SMB had taken America by storm and changed the way NES was packaged and sold . People - *old* people of 30 years or more would get the thing out at parties and challenges would start , to the point that some wives would hide the cords when hosting guests.SMB2 , however , was a damp squib . The game play was so radically different to SMB 's run-jump-and-squish that people were not happy with it . Hell , I sat with one guy and we could n't figure out what we were supposed to do from the start screen . After a few minutes we just played something else.I recently scored a copy of this for the Wii ( with the other Mario Bros games ) and started to explore it . The vertical drop start was stupidly annoying but I did eventually get it started this time around - after an inordinate amount of time wastage.In fact , it is no accident copies of SMB2 for the NES are rare . NES hurried SMB3 into production that featured a more natural SMB mechanic and added a sort of modest exploration mechanic too ( and stuck in some ace puns like the flute from Legend of Zelda which has a *very* different effect in SMB3 ) . SMB2 faded into well-deserved obscurity.It was n't just that the game was n't as much fun as SMB and SMB3 , it fought you when it came to figuring out what you were supposed to *do* and that is just poor design.Yes , I get that the game has its fans who think it is the best thing since sliced bread . Good for them . I would n't have it any other way . There was a short-lived buzz of interest in the early Nintendo Fun Club magazine ( which became Nintendo Power later in life ) to prove they are not alone . But to claim this game has all the appeal of its predecessor or successor is stretching the point as far as the buying majority is concerned . Even Spy Hunter is more fun than this game in my opinion.I also know the eventually unveiled `` real history '' of this game , which was irrelevant to me by the time it was made public . I always knew it as SMB2 . Excuses about it not being a `` real SMB game '' are lame and beside the point.This is the only SMB game I am never tempted to re-visit .	-1
`` Dear God , please let this horrible game be a figment of my imagination '' Nope , it 's real . What an unbelievable piece of overrated garbage Super Mario Bros. 3 is . For the life of me I do n't get the appeal of this game . Through each of the eight boring worlds it 's just the same thing every time : run to the end of each and every extremely short , uncreative level collecting worthless crap so you can move on to the next short , uncreative level . Super Mario Bros. 3 is complete baboon poop . It really is . Nothing good about this game at all . No reason for Mario or video game fans to remember this crappy adventure . No reason for this game to exist . Thank God there are sensible people out there such as myself to give you the honest truth.Let 's get right to the point and talk about all the stinky things : One , and this is the biggest reason Super Mario Bros. 3 is n't any good . You can only play as Mario and Luigi . In Super Mario Bros. 2 you can play as the Princess and Toad in addition to Mario and Luigi . Not so here . In this game , Mario and Luigi do n't even have anything unique to separate the two , so they are basically the same exact person ( except Mario is red and Luigi is green ) . Remember how high Luigi can jump in Super Mario Bros. 2 ? Well now he jumps just like Mario . Absolutely no reason for this . If anything , Luigi should have MANY more interesting things about him this time around since , after all , Super Mario Bros. 3 comes AFTER Super Mario Bros. 2 and you 'd think the most logical thing would be to continue adding MORE things with each new series . But in this case , you get less . I guess Nintendo FORGOT to make Luigi stand apart from Mario.Another problem : this game is so freakin ' predictable . Gee , after the desert world I go to ... a water world ? You do n't say ! What ? There 's an ICE world and a plant world coming up ? No way ! And what 's THIS I see ? The final world will be BIG DARK EVIL FIRE WORLD ? I did n't see THAT coming . Thanks Nintendo , for making Mario fans look like complete idiots . Way to go.Other serious problems become noticeable after a couple hours of playtime such as the fact that you have to do so much boring jumping in this game . You have to jump on top of ( or over ) SO many things that it becomes an absolute chore after world 3 ( if you even MAKE it that far without shutting off the game , that is ) . If you find anything exciting about jumping over pipes or jumping on top of goombas or picking up and kicking buzzy beetles , then I recommend seeking professional help.Ok , what else makes Super Mario Bros. 3 suck so much ? It ca n't get any worse , right ? Yes it can . After you beat the game a message comes up on the screen that says `` Thank you , but our princess is in another castle . Just kidding , hahaha '' . You mean to tell me , after all that long , hard and tedious work making it to the very end , Nintendo is going to joke around and make like the adventure is n't over yet ? Before the `` just kidding '' part , you might very well rip apart your controller or punch a hole in your TV screen all because Nintendo wants to play around and pretend there 's still more to the adventure . I ca n't even think of appropriate words to describe how angry this makes me . Tears of anger are almost dripping down my face . Nintendo NEVER should have done that . I bet that most people who first seen that message really thought the princess was in another castle and came THIS close to killing the nearest living thing next to them . Bad Nintendo.And guess what ? You have to face one of Bowser 's kids at the end of every world . I 'm not kidding . I was honestly expecting to fight Bowser 's WIFE before fighting him , but it never happened . That 's probably for the better . Who knows how horrific she looks.I 'm still trying to figure out what everyone sees in this game . It 's old and forgettable . Honestly , I think nowadays the only people who enjoy Super Mario Bros. 3 are older folks whose children have moved away to college or to start a family , and they left behind their NES and Super Mario Bros. 3 cartridge so their parents had something to do . All these older folks miraculously happen to enjoy the game so now EVERYONE acts like it 's the best game of all-time . Well it 's not .	-1
Even when I was awesome at video games this one made me mad . Whoever designed this game must seriously hate kids . Sure , it 's neat to play as the turtles and beat things up . But it gets so hard that you want to break it in half and throw it out the window . Seriously , what 's wrong with people ?	-1
It is a side scrolling game where you play as all 4 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and pause the game to select a different turtle . Donatello has the longest ranged , slowest and most powerful . Rapheal has the quickest , shortest and least damaging . Michaelangelo and Leonardo are somewhere in between . This game is more difficult than fun . Difficult as opposed to challenging . Most everything can kill you quickly . There are top down areas ( which seem almost pointless ) where you wander from sewer to sewer where the real side scrolling action is . Foot soldiers and various other enemies that do n't quite make sense for a turtles game.This is a game that requires some prescision and the turtles control pretty poorly . There is quite a bounce back when you get hit . Jumps are tough to control . Not a good game at all . It is just a missed oppertunity for what could have been a great debut for the turtles on the NES.The next two turtle games for the NES were much better .	-1
As a kid , I actually somewhat enjoyed this game . It came to Nintendo 's virtual console , so I decided why not download it for a change ? After all , in the late 80 's early 90 's I really enjoyed this game . It was really something to have . Years later it 's apparent of two things : The game was horribly designed , and it CA N'T stand the test of time . The fact that on Nintendo 's VC it 's also a dollar more than the other NES games is also questioning . It 's hard to make a game this bad.If you were a fan of the Turtles a long time ago back in the early 90 's the first thing you 'll notice about the game is that it hardly has anything to do with the show at all outside of some of the major characters . Outside of that there are no foot soldiers , and most of the enemies you encounter you never saw in the show in the first place . You will come across Bebop and Rocksteady but none of the other enemies were actually ever in the show in the first place . Kind of daunting.What really makes the game horrible , however , lies within the gameplay . Firstly , the turtles themselves are unbalanced and put to unfair use . You can switch between any of the turtles at a time , but for the most part , only one of them is of any use to getting you through the adventure . Michaelangelo and Raphael are completely useless , as their weapons lack to the range to actually do anything . Leonardo is alright , but Donatello is the only real useful one here , as he 's the only one who can attack downward and at a range . More than likely you 'll only want to use the other three to sacrifice so that Donatello can do some beating up on enemies.The way the levels are designed is also horrendous . You basically walk around an overworld map and go into sewers , warehouses and whatnot . The problem is that you never know where to go next . This non-linear style would n't be so bad if there were n't so many blasted dead ends . To make the experience even more grueling , the game is just FULL of enemies that will respawn almost the second you turn around . You could go through a tough warehouse fighting tons of tough enemies , only to find you ca n't go any further . So now you 'll have to backtrack and you may have to fight all those enemies again . So if you do n't lose a turtle getting to a dead end , you 'll probably lose him getting from it.The game is n't really difficult , it 's just unfair and frustrating . The fact that two of your four players are completely useless tells you something . The later turtles games were far better than this . Skip the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game . It 's so unfair that the experience is frustrating . Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II and III were far better , and there 's still no turtles game that beats the all time best : Turtles IV : Turtles in Time . If you need a classic Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fix , the first Turtles game on the NES is n't going to do it .	-1
But that 's to be expected . I got it for a decent enough price and it 's a pretty easy start for people looking to collect games	-1
This is a dull , near impossible flight simulating game . Its not all that based on the movie , there is no real story , you are just a F-14 fighter in hostile territory . You have guns and select the rockets and missiles to use before each mission ( level ) .It is a nice flight simulator , but its just dull with long periods of sky , no clouds , no sea , no land , no obsticles . Then there is the challenge . Enemies firing rockets at you from sea and air . One rocket and you 're dead , I suppose its like that in real life . Enemy jets get behind you and you need to shake them before they destroy you with their rockets or missiles.Then halfway through a mission , you will need more jet fuel , so the flying fuel tanker flies in and you need to get the fuel just right or die trying . At the end of each mission , you need to land on an aircraft carrier with perfection . Too fast , you crash , too slow , you crash , too high , you crash , too low , you crash.Its a prescise game , so if you love prescision , this is your game ! However , for casual gamers , this is a frustratingly difficult and unfun game .	-1
NES Top GunHated this game growing up ! I never could land the freaking plane ! Impossible.I got this game back in the mid 1980s when it came out . I hated it . Namely because I never could land the damn plane on the freaking aircraft carrier.For a mid 1980s game , it 's a fairly decent , if boring , flight simulator . But do n't think you 'll be getting a real flight simulator . You just chose your plane , then you you fly in this big boring blue frame for a while , and try to dodge missles . There 's no real music . That 's the whole game . There are four missions , but I only got to the third mission . There 's a good reason for that.But what makes this game so notorious for those who remember it ( my generation , basically ) , is landing the plane on the aircraft carrier . When you land the plane , you get a long approach , in which the game will continually tell you to press up or down on the control pad , to made sure you are aligned properly . And no matter how meticulously you follow the instructions , YOU ALMOST ALWAYS CRASH . I can remember being a little kid and getting so frustrated at this game because I could never land . My brother landed once or twice , but that 's about it.The other bad part is , I think in mission 3 , you have to fuel midair when a big fuel plane comes up on top of you . Just like landing , you have to press up or down to make sure the cable that will transport the gas from the fuel plane to your aircraft is properly aligned . Just like the landing on the aircraft , you can never make the connection . If the connection is not made , then the fuel aircraft will break the connection , leaving you to certain death as you will run out of fuel before you reach the aircraft carrier , which you wo n't be able to land on anyway.The reason why I could never get past mission three is , if I remember correctly , you have three lives . You lose the first two lives on the first two missions because you ca n't land , then you lose your life because you ca n't fuel . I think the fourth mission has to do with a space shuttle , but I never knew any of my friends who had the game to get to that level.Just a really bad game . Google Angry Video Game Nerd 's review of it , he is , as usual , spot on ( beware , he has a lot of adult language to the point his reviews are borderline obscene , but still funny as hell ) .Oh , also , this game has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE MOVIE . The movie even came out well before the game . NO CONNECTION at all .	-1
Well it looks like Acclaim was trying to get their feet wet with the first licensed WWF video game . I picked this up at a flea market a couple of years ago , but really I had no memory of this game as a kid . Maybe because it was the first one they made , or maybe beacause it really is n't that good . I played a lot of the other wrestling games as a kid mostly for SNES and was hoping it would be like an earlier version of those games with the old school WWF characters that we usually do n't get to wrestle with . Seeing Hogan on the cover just reminded me of when I was a kid so I bought it.From the start it looks good . There 's only 6 wrestlers to choose from but there all classics with there own invidual moves . The characters in the game for the most part look like the wrestlers ( except Million Dollar Man ) -looks like a fat cowboy . When you start the match you 'll notice no crowd is present , the ring is surrounded by nothing but black space . The actual gameplay is pretty basic . Kick , and Punch , hold down both buttons and do a body slam.Each guy has a custom move like Bam Bam Bigelow doing his cartwheel . You can climb the bottom turnbuckles and jump off them . That 's about it . Unfortunately , body slams do n't play too much into this game . Get down the moves and see if you can beat the tournament . If you do beat this game chances are your going to do it on kicks & punches.I would basically skip this game all together if I could have . Go with any of the other titles that came out after this .	-1
It 's been said that everyone has to start somewhere , but man , what a stinker of a starting point ! The prerequisites of all that is Mega Man are present ; the multi-tiered platform stages , those wacky bosses , the `` rock-paper-scissors '' weapon mentality , and it all would 've been great if it was n't made with 1986 NES technology . Many of the major sins present include slow and choppy scrolling , uninspired level art , repetitive level design , and Mega Man climbing a ladder way too slow and dropping like a rock when falling from a great height . It could 've been more , much MUCH more , and looking back after being spoiled on the later games it 's hard to consider this the genius it was meant to be .	-1
No energy tanks , fancy gadgets , spike invulnerability when hit , and two less robot masters than most games in the series make this debut the bad kind of hard . The stages and bosses are EXTREMELY hard without the right equipment . The next one , Mega Man 2 , is where greatness would first be reached .	-1
The game is good but apparently the seller I bought this from is not . It took 3 times for the game to even come up and it randomly crashes ! The seller said it was in good condition and it was not . It was rattling , and the outside of it was a bit rough looking . Be careful who you buy this from !	-1
If only it were possible to rate a zero , this game would have earned it . Not only should this game NEVER have been made , every copy found to exist should be destroyed . It 's an abomination to the license and one of the worst games ever created in the history of Nintendo . Yeah , I 'm a fan of Zelda . No , I do n't like easy games . I like games which challenge my skill & intellect , not my patience & sanity . I disliked Zelda II when it first came out but gave it a second chance when offered as a free download to my 3DS from Nintendo . After a very solid second shot , it 's now deleted from my system . Where can I even begin ? ? There are no rewards for defeating opponents . The control is appalling . There 's no strategy involved . It 's too easy to get hurt , almost impossible to heal , and no matter where you are in the game , dying forces you to start over at the beginning . This is n't a game . This is a violation of the Geneva Convention . Unless you have a mental disorder which causes you to enjoy having to complete the same monotonous tasks OVER AND OVER , do n't bother . In fact , the game could even cost you hundreds to play . For some , the torment & frustration could cause you to destroy a perfectly good console . It would n't have taken much to turn this into an enjoyable game . It 's as though the designers were TRYING to kill the Zelda license . Thank God it survived to have a third title . But the second title should have been recalled & buried .	-1
Ahh Zelda , arguably the greatest video game franchise ever made . I owned , and still own the very first Zelda video game , and I must say , it is to this day the greatest 8 bit game ever designed . I had never played the Zelda 2 for the nes before . I had heard a lot of negative things about this game , for being a rather weak installment in the Zelda series . Not listening , I decided to purchase this game for the wii virtual console . Guess what ? They were right ! This game is bad ! I kept saying to myself `` there are no , bad Zelda games . There are no , bad Zelda games . '' As you can probably see , I ripped that quote off from the Wizard of Oz , `` There 's no place , like home . '' Quite fitting if you ask me.Adventure Link is quite the sloppy one . You go from one perspective , to another . Quite irritatting if you ask me . It 's a shame how good the graphics are , and how unfitting the gameplay is . The gameplay is not stiff , but slippery . It feels like you are in an ice level throughout the entire game . No joke.The change in graphics are very good for the nes system . I find it quite detailed , and a big push for the nes console . I also can not take the fact that the music is absolutely beautiful , and the only reson I play this crappy game . I mean just listen to this track [ ... ] Awesome right ? That 's about all you get out of this game . Overall , this game sucks ! I can certainly see why fans did n't like it . A combination of hard platforming , bad gameplay , and poor writing , makes the game unplayable . I know I am a huge Zelda fan , but I have yet to play a link to the past . I am planning on purchasing it on the wii virtual console in the next couple of weeks , and once I do , I will review it immediately.Thanks for reading !	-1
Although the first in a popular series , this is n't the best and is incomparable to Super Metroid . Granted the game is big , which means there is lots of exploring , there is one set of closely related problems that make Metroid less than steller , all related to attacking : Samus curls ( or does nothing if you do n't have the ball ) when you press down so she can not duck and shoot , disabling her from attacking small anemies on the ground until she has the ball-bomb or wave beam much later in the game . Additionally , Samus can not shoot diagnally in any direction and she can not shoot downwards . In my review of Super Mario 64 , I said that one should n't only complain about what a game does NOT have ; however , these features would be practically essential to the game.Buy only if you are a hardcore Metroid fan or you really want to play the game that started it all . Otherwise , look somewhere else .	-1
The nintendo Revolution will be backward campatable through the nes games of the '80s so why would you waste your money on this ? In with the new out with the old .	-1
This game for me is a weak attempt to copy the game 'Tetris ' . It just isnt as fun or challenging as i had hoped . The only plus that i see with this game is that it would be preferred over tetris by children because of the colorful graphics and cartoon look . So if you have children and are looking for a good clean kid friendly game to keep them entertained and expand their hand/eye coordination then this game might be a good choice .	-1
Mickey MousecapadeThree stars - somewhat playable by today 's standards , but there 's better fare out there '' Mickey Mousecapade '' , the first of a series of highly successful Capcom games using Disney trademarks , was published by Capcom in Nintendo but actually developed Hudson Soft in Japan . It the only Capcom published Disney game not actually developed by Capcom . Several sprites from the game are directly lifted from other Hudson Soft games . `` Mickey Mousecapade '' is certainly one of the more obscure titles in the Capcom library . The game has some rather ugly graphics ( even for an NES title ) , but the game certainly has its own style of charm.There are numerous regional differences between the Japanese and North American versions . The stage bosses are all different between the two versions , and so is much of the enemy roster . The Japanese version is more heavily based on `` Alice in Wonderland '' .The plot of the game is to rescue a friend of Mickey and Minni , who turns out to be Alice of `` Alice in Wonderland '' . The final boss is Maleficent from `` Sleeping Beauty '' in the US versiona nd the Queen of Hears from `` Alice in Wonderland '' in the Japanese version . Pete , who is often the final boss in Disney games , is the fourth boss in the American version.Strangely enough , there is a Hidden Mickey embedded in the circuit board , clearly visible when the game cartridge is disassembled.Like the NES `` The Adventures of Tom Sawyer '' , the graphics are ugly and primitive . Although published in Japan in 1987 , `` Mickey Mousecapade '' was published in 1988 in North America , the same year `` Ninja Gaiden '' , `` Blaster Master '' and `` The Guardian Legend '' were published . The grapchis are so bad the game looks like an NES launch title rather than one published later.Ultimately , Capcom 's other Disney games far outshine this title . Unless you are nostalgic for this title , the NES offers much better fare than this . Although to be fair , the NES also offers much WORST fare than this game as well.While Mickey Mousecapade does offer some enjoyment , I would recommend `` Duck Tales '' , `` Duck Tales 2 '' , `` Chip and Dale '' , `` Chip and Dale 2 '' , `` Little Mermaid '' , `` Aladdin '' , or `` The Jungle Book '' over this travesty.The video game website IGN rated this title as the 877h greatest game on their top 100 NES games of all time . ( For those looking for great unknown NES/Famicom games , you simply MUST play `` Moon Crystal '' , a criminally unknown Famicom exclusive . The graphics are astounding with cutscenes that even outdo `` Ninja Gaiden '' , amazing music , in depth gameplay , and a fantastic storyline . Absolutely amazing ! Had this been released in the US for the NES , I feel it would be as revered as the other heavy hitters in the NES canon ) If you [ likes hooters ] Two stars - barely playable by today 's standards	-1
Capcom usually creates awesome games after Disney titles , but when they came out with this , it was questioned whether or not Capcom were capable of licensing Disney titles since Mickey Mousecapade was its first . Its a s**tty game ! It starts off as a ok game ( you find magic stars in a Fun House and shoot random animals and moving deadly furniture ) , but the formula goes on and on and on ... The levels do get harder ( too hard for a kids ' game ) , but the repetitiveness and cheap deaths does n't fair too well . The cheapest death is when Minnie falls off the ledge , your character ( Mickey ) falls with her . She is a liability throughout the whole game so controlling her while playing as Mickey can be a b***h ! The second cheapest death is getting hit and stopping in midair ( especially when you 're over a cliff or water in mid-jump ) . This does n't give you much time to steer your jumps , but its better than the `` backwards hit '' bulls**t found in other games . The game frustrated me as a kid and I never got past the final level because the damn eagle is always kidnapping Minnie and rescuing her is always a hassle . Also , on the pirate ship level ( Level 4 ) , you might as well turn the game off if you did n't happen to get the second magic stars for Minnie in level 1 . Pegleg Pete will throw a zillion of knives at your direction so it will be impossible to deck him without loosing a life . The only trick is making sure Minnie has her stars because she 'll be immune to Pete 's attacks ( making sure she jumps on the ledge of where Pete is attacking is kind of a hassle ) . Without a word of mouth from a friend who happened to make this trick work through trial and error or with a Nintendo Power magazine , you 're stuck . Though the internet will may now give you a clear walkthrough on this frustrating abomination , its not worth a dollar ( go buy a McDouble cheese burger with it instead of this s**tty game ) . Other Disney titles that Capcom will make in the future would be a huge improvement in gameplay and graphics such as Duck Tales , Rescue Rangers , and Darkwing Duck so try those out and stay away from `` Mickey Mousecrapade , '' please !	-1
I got this game hoping it would be just as good as any sonic game on the market , maybe even better ! This game is WAY to easy . Do n't get me wrong , the graphics are incredibale ! There is just no point to this game . My friend also has this , or I should say HAD it . He smashed it and threw it in the trash he hated it so much . Do n't buy this . Get sonic and knucles instead .	-1
DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU COLLECT OLD GAME SYSTEMS . FOR THOSE WITH NEWER SYSTEMS YOU CAN GET THE SONIC GAMES FOR THOSE SYSEMS .	-1
I 'm probably one of very , very few people who liked Carmageddon 3 better than the second one . The controls are poor . More often than not , the enemies would fight me a bit , then run away somewhere , usually getting trapped in some tight corridor where I could n't get enough speed to destroy them , or the godawful water . I must 've spent a third of my time trying to work underwater . Sure , it gives you an underwater ability powerup , but it does n't help very much.I guess killing peds is fun , but it gets old pretty fast . So does ramming your car into your oppenents over and over only to have nothing happen . No damage . No credits . No time bonus . Nothing . Even once I had built up a lot of armor , power , and offensive , I still had a problem with it.There 's a lot of flipping over in this game . A lot . Way too much . I got stuck upside down or on my side even from just hitting a slight bump . The enemies got flipped over a lot too . Not very fun.The game was alright at first , but it got old really fast .	-1
The first Mana game , Final Fantasy Adventure , was awesome . So was its remake called Sword of Mana . And Secret of Mana , for the SNES , was an amazing classic beloved by many after all these years . So what happened with Legend of Mana ? First off , this game doesnt have the free flowing world and fighting of the previous games . There is no linking areas to travel between . Each area/dungeon has its own little space and must be found by doing quests . After you have obtained the new area you can place it anywhere on the world map , for reasons not wholly known or cared for . Its a very strange concept at best.And the battles . Oh , what a terrible system ! When you enter a battle , all of which are preset and can not be avoided , your character moves in stutter steps . He/she moves somewhat like a fencer , a pace at a time . This makes for awkward movement . And if you want to dodge enemies you have to move up and down . Want to attack ? You can only attack the left and right . This two-way dodge/attack system was totally uneccessary compared to Sword and Secret of Manas free moving combat.And the difficulty of the game ... or lack there of.In battle you can hide in a corner and slowly replenish life . Have a teamate ? Stand close to them and you will regain life about 3x faster then normal . And sometimes defeated enemies drop candy which replenish all or most of your life . Oh , and after every battle you regain ALL of your life.There are more ways to heal your character in battle than to attack ! All in all this game is a garbled mess . Its a failed attempt of Square to make a 'unique ' Mana game which strays from the original formula . I can not believe this game came from the same company as Secret of Mana , the Chrono games , and the Final Fantasy games . Avoid at all costs .	-1
I loved Secret of Mana , the earlier Mana game on the Super Nintendo , and loved it -- among many other Square games . I was really happy to get my hands on this new Mana game ... but I am incredibly disappointed in it ! The game has no storyline . After a neat intro , you control a very generic guy or girl character ( named & quot ; YOU & quot ; ) that rarely speaks . You choose a spot on a blank map for your home , then place other areas of the game on joining spaces , eventually building up a big world.Other characters in the game come and go as little & quot ; mini-quests & quot ; pop up ( bookended by a cute title and little & quot ; The End & quot ; scene whenever you complete the quest ) . Completing the quests basically consists of walking around an area on your map and killing enemies and a boss enemy.This brings up the battle system , which is a step back from Secret of Mana . Instead of the fast-paced gameplay of SoM , you are drawn into little battles when you near enemies . Battling mainly consists of pushing buttons quickly while near enemies . The graphics do n't allow for much detail , so any sense of strategy is hopeless . You have little real control over the other characters in your team ( unless you go through the trouble of setting up two-player play , which is often more hassle than it 's worth ) .The graphics are nice , though incredibly happy . Still , it is as if players are controlling a small part of a nice piece of animation ... the animation , however , has no plot or sense of coherency . The graphics do not make up for the incredibly bad gameplay and lack of story.Even if you were a fan of Secret of Mana or love Square 's other games , do not rush out and buy Legend of Mana . Instead rent the game and , if you like what you see , then consider buying it . I am disappointed I bought the game without previewing it first . I do n't think I would have wanted to see the game through after seeing its poor quality .	-1
Despite all that , there is a right way to do them , as well as the wrong way , which they just did . If you want a plot that works , make every action depending upon your specific reaction have roughly ten possible outcomes , but then merge them later weave 20 or 30 separate plots depending on what you have done , and that can suddenly shift if you do something really odd , and make the story alter entirely . Instead Legend of Mana appeared from when I played it to be nothing more than a bunch of loosely strung together garbage- go to a town , solve the puzzle , hear a bunch of drivel that does n't add up to anything else in your head , get the item and build a new town . The only thing that was recurring was that the faerie princess kept losing her way from what I played , but what did that have to do with anything.This is an example of a good nonlinear plot : You are a child in a town that gets destroyed by an evil overlord . The survivors worship you as the hero and fully expect you to right wrongs and destroy the overlord ( base plot ) . Now as you set out , you 're swinging your sword about like a fool and you kill a cat by accident . You get arrested for animal cruelty , and put in prison . So then in prison you meet a rogue girl who sets you free , and she tell you that the overlord is small potatoes , that the real problem is this organization that is supposed to be the law but is imposing too harse penalties on minor offenses , so under her tutelage , you become a career criminal . OR you continue on your way and the overlord send an assassin to poison your drink , but she has a change of heart and drug it instead . You get sent as a slave to be a gladiator , but you fight well and impress the army and instead fight in a war . OR you continue unswayed and finally reach the overlord 's castle only it seems the townspeople were lying , the guy is really a paladin who saw extreme corruption in the town , and put an end to it , and he has proof . So you march right back tothe town and see that he was right.This is nonlinear plotline , the plot can make any twist imaginable throughout the game , even sacricing the original antagonize or even the hero . Assume the hero died in the thief story , the plot might now revolve around the rogue girl , and her adventures .	-1
What a shock . That 's all I can say . Secret of Mana ( SoM ) and it 's ilk that used the same game engine ( most notably Secret of Evermore ) defined , in my heart , what a live action RPG should be . There where several key things that defined the SoM game.One was the co-op play with another player ( up to three players total ) . This allowed the game to be put into the & quot ; play at parties & quot ; pile . Games are fun by yourself , even more fun when two skilled players are in on it . Sadly this is poorly implemented in Legend of Mana ( LoM ) . It 's bad enough when the other player has a hard time interacting with the game world . Worse when you have to go to a & quot ; special & quot ; place for that second person to join . Even lower still when the NPC 's are unstable . By that I mean in SoM the two NPC characters only left the main character alone for any great amount of time once , after joining the party . LoM NPC 's do n't stick around for very long . At least the other player can & quot ; import & quot ; their characters.The other was the incredible item wheel . This gaming innovation allowed the player to quickly select any item or spell in the heat of battle . This wonderful innovation in gaming is sadly missing and once again players are forced to suffer through menus.And finally , the battles stink . SoM allowed complete and total freedom when dealing with the baddies ( Except for the level bosses ) . You chose to stay and fight or you chose to run for cover . LoM battles are loaded on an area by area basis and running is not an option . This is n't a problem at first but your patience will wear out very quickly after you fought the same dang monsters for the 26th time.I own the Japanese sequel to SoM . Suffice to say it is not fair to make this kind of punishing leap to the American market when the American market expects a sequel to SoM and not Seiken Densetsu 3 . ALL of the key elements that made SoM a sleeper hit in the US is missing in this one . LoM is nothing more than an empty collectors item . Although this game does have a few redeeming qualities . I gave one star to the eye-popping eye-candy , which make this a great game to watch . And the colorful world is a joy to explore , but strip it all away and what do you have ? An empty game that is trying to cash in on the underground success of SoM.I give another star to the insight of ingenious programmer who configured the controls for one-handed use . You 'll need it when your brain reduces it 's operating level to a minimum while playing .	-1
The sequel to 7th Guest , 11th hour turns what was sort of a fairy tale horror story ( like Frankenstein ) into something much more 'gritty ' and adult . I was very dissapointed . Issues such as rape , mutilation , and lots of gore are brought up in this game and all of the psychological horror of the previous game ( which is what made it such a ball for me to play ) has been forgotten.The plot goes along and you 're a reporter seeking his friend who is trapped in the mansion of Stauf . A lot of things from the previous game were ignored ... in 7th guest the mansion ws up on a high rocky hill and in 11th hour its now in a grassy lot with an iron fence around it.I did n't like the fact that they decided to make such a unique concept into something more 'adult and gritty ' , and as I progressed through the storyline I began to pretty much hate everyone in the game character wise . Are n't you supposed to want to save people ? On a technical aspect , the folks that have re-released this game have done nothing to update the software at all and there is a very high likleyhood that this wo n't run on your machine . My copy decided to install a little shareware VGA driver on my computer without my permission and it was an annoyance to get rid of.Overall , the dissapointing story and software problems made this game not worth the money , even at the reasonable price being offered for it .	-1
I was very disappointed in the technical aspects of this game . I really enjoyed & quot ; The 7th Guest & quot ; , and I thought that I would enjoy this one as well . Unfortunately , getting the disk to run was a MAJOR nightmare ! After spending an hour and a half trying to get the game to start ( the game required me to change and configure audio drivers , without giving any help doing it ! ) , I was finally able to get it to go , but even then the sound was pretty much shot . Other problems I had with it : 1 ) it would n't remember the sound settings that took forever to change . When I would try to play the next time , I would have to & quot ; uninstall & quot ; the game and reinstall - losing any saved games ! 2 ) The puzzles , when I could access them , were INSANELY hard ! Without the help of a good cheat guide , forget it ! All in all , it looked like it had potential but I would NOT recommend this to ANYONE ! What were the designers thinking ? Give me a game that I can just stick in and play !	-1
If you 've played 7th Guest , you 've played 11th Hour . It 's the same house -- the same puzzles -- the same general story -- and most of the same actors . Did they think that adding more and better FMV cutscenes would disguise that ? Puh-LEASE.The only really positive thing about the game is how much fun it is to wander through an abandoned house poking at things . The puzzles are all of the improbable chess-problem sort , and several of them require you to play against the computer , a situation that is not always winnable . Quite frustrating ! especially since every wrong move you make gets you an insulting remark by the overacting villain . Add to it that the basic story is hopelessly contrived and silly , the ending unrewarding , and the neverending music boring and hokey , and ... well , I would n't call it a winner.If you 're intrigued by ghost stories , go play 7th Guest . It 's more fun and at least has the benefit of originality .	-1
I would have given it two and a half stars , but I 'll have to give it two . There are some fun puzzles in this game , but it lacks a lot.One -- some of the puzzles are badly unoriginal . The worst example of this is a player piano that imitates the game & quot ; Simon & quot ; , where you have to remember the tune and play it back . Other puzzles almost repeat themselvesTwo -- the puzzles do not interact with the game play at all . The game is basically just a walkthrough movie , with puzzles here and there to solve so that you can make it to the next part of the movie . In this respect , it is somewhat like the game & quot ; Fool 's Errand & quot ; Three -- the animation moves too darn slow in the puzzles . When you click on a move , the characters or icons on the screen move annoyingly slow.Overall though , if you buy it cheap off the rack , it will be worth it for you . But it is still not a great game at all .	-1
Sim City 3K Unlimited is definately a great game , but it does n't work correctly on many systems . This is the only PC game I have ever encountered that my CD drives scratch just by using it ( mind you I have no clue why . I excanged it twice already ) . It only works correctly running windows 95 or 98 , none of the 2000 editions ( ME , 2000 , XP ) . If you are a fan of the Sim City Franchise , buy this game and make sure you have the reccommended requirements for best gameplay . Otherwise , I would n't reccommend it .	-1
Let me first say , I love Sim City 2000 and 3000 . I am one of those guys who waited for 6 years for 3000 to come out . And it was ... ok , not great but ok. Maxis had promised all kinds of things like a transportation package that would let you build monorails ... where is it ? Another thing , this is the 3rd installment-excuse me , 4th installment , and you still see the same buildings over and over again in your city ? Oh come on ! If you have Sim City 3000 , dont spend money on this . Aside from the building creator that you can download and buildings you can also get from others , there really isnt anything new here worth plunking down $ . Thumbs down !	-1
Do n't get me wrong Sim City 2000 was great I loved it . But this game is just Sim City 2000 with better graphics . Thats all I have to say . Im mad I bought it when I already have Sim City 2000 . Oh yea you can not make farms , I tried , its imposible .	-1
SimCity 3k has great graphics hands-down , but if you 've played oyther SimCitys then you 've played SimCity 3k . The gameplay is identical with minor tweaks here and there , but with most of the hype that went into this game left out . You ca n't tweak individual buildings , or really get into the management of a city as you would like to . Once again things like subways and buses operate without an revenue generation ( what country in the world gives away public transportation ? ) , thus tying your economic fate to basically taxes ( which are a simple model as well ) and some policies . Graphics are great , but the gameplay is the same as before .	-1
I have liked every game Dreamcatcher has ever released , but this one was a little tough to swallow . In typical Dreamcatcher fashion , the graphics are wonderful and the music is very relaxing and laid back . I think the reason for the calming music was the fact that this game is very annoying . Now . I consider myself to be pretty good at solving puzzle games , and if I get stuck , I call a couple of friends and we work these out together . But neither of us liked this game very well . the clues are n't detailed enough and many of these puzzles are repititious . You do n't know if you have done the puzzle right until the end of that sequence . Very annoying . when they speak to you , it 's like your speaking to Confuscious . Very hard to discern the clues they are giving . My suggestion is spend your money on another Dreamcatcher game : Traitors Gate . That is a game worthy of all point and click puzzle solving game players .	-1
This game has very good graphics but the excitement is not so high . This game is very theoretic and leaves you thinking . Personally , I would n't recommend this game just because it was n't as fun as I thought it would be . But hey , that 's just me ! It 's a good game if you 're in to serious philosphies and wonders about life .	-1
This game was so icky I did n't even finish it . The rendered characters all appeared to have some sort of unhealthy skin condition , and tended to rock back and forth while delivering their bad voice bits . The locations were pretty , but the node-to-node navigation was extremely frustrating . Some of the puzzles were n't too bad , but others were pretty far fetched . Between the creepy characters , the dizzying navigation and the inane puzzles , I just could n't bring myself to continue .	-1
Quake for Dreamcast is a HUGE disappointment ! ! ! The games has a useless , irrelevant single player on par with Outtrigger and since online in no longer available the game is all but virtually useless except if you have friends over.The game play is a little too fast and control on the controller ( although it can be customised ) is difficult . Aiming and tracking enemies becomes unbearably difficult with the controller and brings the game down more than anything else ! ! Nothing is more frustrating than trying to dodge and return fire through strifing , it is accomplished much easier in Outtrigger ! Overall Quake Arena is a serious let down ! ! I have Quake 2 on my PC and enjoyed the single player missions which are in NO WAY found in Quake Arena ! I was really excited to get this game as I read all the over-hyped reviews on this site and others ... but my heart was broken by frustrating and frantic speeds coupled with annoying aiming or lack of aiming mechanism.I was first introduced to the genre through the multi-player Deathmatch of Rainbow 6 : Rogue Spear on the DC and that was a much better experience with my friends . The idea of stealth , sniping , throwing grenades around corners and planting c4 all made that title a much better investment . Quake Arena lacks ALL that and exchanges it with fast running ... shoot ... run out of ammo ... run ... run ... shoot with no strategy ... run etc . You get the point . The game simply has you running VERY fast and struggling to process all the action.On the plus side the game has good graphics , sound and the ability to turn blood OFF ... thats it the positives end there ! My final word is simply this ... & quot ; Look elsewhere for a good FPS & quot ;	-1
Due to the hype of other Dreamcast enthusiasts , I decided to purchase this game around 6 years ago . Unfortunately , to this day , I do not understand why so many claim this game as one of the systems shining titles.Six years ago was about the time many online games on the Dreamcast were being shut down for good . Since , as a whole , I was new to the online gaming scene at the time , I wanted to try all online Dreamcast games before it was to late . This led to my discovery and experiences with games such as Phantasy Star Online and Unreal Tournament . Both were HIGHLY addictive in their own special way and they were also well developed for the Dreamcast in terms of control AND performance ; online and off.On the other hand , this game was most certainly not . From the first time I played this game , and subsequent times after , only pure misery has followed.First the..ughh , good parts.Since this game allows PC players to host games and dedicated servers , it is still TO THIS DAY one of a definite few titles that remains online on the Dreamcast . As a result of the PC link , there are also a couple `` mods '' that exist for the game when played online to . In addition , I will admit that it is graphically superior to many of the systems other previously online FPS 's and while not by any means fun , it does offer 4 player offline action . It also offers ( iffy as you 'll read later ) completely customizable controls.Sadly those are all the good parts I can think of ( and I tried hard ! ) , so now onto the bad.You have to get a keyboard and mouse to get any enjoyment out of it . For starters , I do n't like the statements people are making that interested parties NEED to invest in a keyboard and mouse to play this . Though the keyboard is certainly good for communication purposes , I have always felt the combination of it and a mouse do not belong on a game console . Furthermore , this statement is just giving an excuse to the developers of this game for poorly implemented controls and functionality.As I said previously , the controls are basically impossible to work with . Though I ca n't quite remember its layouts , UT had very good control configurations . In addition , there was a small hint of auto-aiming that made the game fluid to control ; I will gladly admit the Dreamcast controller was horribly suited to FPSs . This game however gives you 4 or 5 preset controller combinations that all feel bad and overly loose . There is no slight auto-aiming and you ca n't help but lose all control of your character when you become engaged in a firefight.To add to the package of horrible controls , the game also brings bad network functionality . Quake 3 ca n't even hold up with 37.5 % of Unreal 's maximum player count even if it 's games are hosted on a powerful dedicated server . I 'll admit 1 on 1 games run decent , but anything more is just a total lag fest which is totally unacceptable . Ugh , Unreal Tournament supported 8 players over dialup AND it ran BUTTERSMOOTH to boot . To this day I ca n't imagine any game-PC or Console- that was better performing over dialup and as horrible as it sounds , I wish this game would have lost it 's online functionality forever instead of Unreal.There are likely many other factors I may have missed going over in this review . Suffice to say , the subjects of control and network functionality are 2 things that count above all in an online FPS to ME and this game completely missed the mark in those areas.I still own this title since I have a hard time letting go of even my least prized games , but hear this now , it will NEVER hold a place in my heart as one of the best Dreamcast games ever .	-1
These Sega Sports games all suffer from the same problem : they rely on looks and not on gameplay . This game is repetitive drivel and I ca n't find a reason for recommending it . So I wo n't .	-1
Wow , what a let down . Having played and enjoyed both Mario party games on the N64 , I was looking forward to seeing what the dreamcast could do with a sonic board game . While Sonic and friends have never really reached the same level of character recognition as the Mario and Luigi crowd , I was hoping the graphic muscle of the DC would at least squeeze some light hearted fun out of Sonic Shuffle . What we found when we played for many hours last night was dissappointment and frustration . First , the graphics look just plain bad in my opinion . The opening shots and menus look promising but the actual game screens made me think I had seen better on the N64 . In particular , some of the environmental effects like water looked awful , like the animations were running about 4 frames per second . Very choppy and unpleasant to stare at while you are waiting for the computer players to take their turns . You ca n't turn them off by the way , so there is no such thing as short game . Between that and the long load times , you can expect to be spending alot of time just sitting around yawning.It 's the gameplay , stupid ! Even with lousy looks , this game could have emerged from the depths if it had good , engaging gameplay . Instead , this is an example of what NOT to do in a video game . Without going into great detail , I will say the the computer players cheat , the mini-games leave you with no control over your characters , and ultimately the complete random , unexplained nature of why and when things happen will make you feel like you are completely out of control of your character 's fate . You may as well just sit back and watch what happens , because nothing you can do will really effect anything . This game is one of the worst I have seen to come from the folks at SEGA , who recently have been putting out some fantastic games- Jet Grind Radio and Skies of Arcadia would make me buy my system all over again . I 'm thinking that maybe Sonic Shuffle was made by some sub-team of developers working in some broom closet in the basement of the Sega building . They should be fired or sent back to game design school .	-1
Before I wanted this , I expected this to be a fun , entertaining experience . Instead , I got this : bad AI , boring gameplay , and only 8 playable characters . I expected more out of Sonic Shuffle.On paper , Sonic Shuffle is great : picking out cards , moving to spaces , and getting the most Precious Stones . In practice , it is the opposite . This is a very boring game , and with the AI , they can be very hard to beat , even on the Easy difficulty setting . The game 's story is horrible : A fairy named Lumina asks the Sonic team to help her get Precious Stones and save everyone 's dreams from Void . Yeah , it 's a baby story.The graphics are suprisingly good.The sound is so bad.This game does n't live up to its full potential . Add minigames that are either frustrating or confusing , and you 've got one of the worst games ever made .	-1
I have Mario Party 1 and 2 and they came out befoe this.Sonic Shuffle is a mario party wannabe.The mini games stink on ice.And its pointless , all you do is pick a card and it walks by itself.If you wan na good sonic game get sonic adventure 2.This has bad graphics and takes a long time to play .	-1
I rented this game with some of my friends mostly because I think Sonic is really cool and I thought this game would also be . I could n't believe it ! Besides this game being Mario Party with different characters it has a huge learning curve . I will explain ... Sonic Shuffle is basically a board game in which you get cards that have numbers from 1-6 & amp ; S ( S is a random number from 1-7 ) in which you use to defeat enemies and screw up your oponents . A gem is placed somewhere on the board and it is a race to the jewel ... as soon as you reach the jewel you have to face an enemie that defends the gem and if defeated you win the gem . The learning curve is not knowing where to go . The computer knows exactly which way to go , and even shortcuts to the gem ! I 'm not saying I am a sore loser but they could atleast make it an easier learning curve AND not have putten a N64 game onto a 128-bit system ( mario party ) . If you are looking for a fun party game , look else where and see what other 4-player games they have out for Sega Dreamcast . Good luck shopping/browsing .	-1
When I first read about Sonic Shuffle it got mixed reviews but since I was desperate for a new experience in gaming for the Dreamcast ( the best system that never made it ) I bought the game . I must say that it has sweet cel shading graphics and thats it ! This game is really uninspired and tedious ! My biggest gripe ( among many ) is that THE MULTIPLAYER GAMES ARE BORING , UNINSPIRED AND JUST PLAIN SUCK ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I was origionally drawn to it by the boasts of many mulitplayer games but boy was I fooled ! There are probably three ( if so much ) of these games that are fun , trust me the mini ames are BAD ! ! One game puts three players in a frying pan and the fourth player gets to turn it and toss it as if they are making pancakes , WEAK SEGA , WEAK ! DO NOT BUY THIS MESS ! ! ! IT IS NOT FUN ! ! ! TAILS IS THE MOST ANNOYING CHARACTER EVER CREATED I HATE THE WAY HE ALWAYS HAS TO CALL SONIC FOR EVERYTHING ! ! ! SOMEONE AT SEGA SHOULD GET A CAREER CHANGE AND GO INTO LICKING ENVELOPES AT THHE POST OFFICE , A JOB THAT REQUIRES LITTLE THOUGHT BECAUSE HE OBVIOUSLY DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH TO PUT INTO SONIC SHUFFLE TO MAKE IT ORIGIONAL OR FUN ! !	-1
I 'm gon na get this out of the way right now : this game is aggravating . It starts off slow and does not pick up . I first got a taste of it at my friend 's party last weekend . We were both pumped to play it and could n't wait for other guests to arrive so we could have four people playing at once . Well , the excitement wore off as soon as we started playing . The game board was right out of Mario Party and did n't look too exciting . The mini-games were dull and too short.Before too long , the other guests watching were getting bored out of their minds . And so were the people playing . But it 's not like we did n't give it a chance ! We persisted . We wanted to like it ! Then , my friend did us all a favor : he turned off . Sadly , the rest of the guests cheered . Not the sign of a good game . I 'm sticking with board games .	-1
I am a fan of Sonic the Hedgehog . I have been there for better and for worse ( like when they added the super-annoying Amy Rose as a character ) . I have always liked Sonic as a video game character.Nonetheless , this game is awful . First of all , the premise of this game is stolen from the game Mario Party . Cloned games can be alright , considering that the developers do n't rely too heavily on the origial game for inspiration and design . Sadly , the makers of Sonic Shuffle do exactly that -- they rely completely on the design of Mario Party to patent their game after . They make no attempt to hide the fact that they are copying off of Mario Pary.And when game developers create a clone , it should be equal or better than the original , or else , they 'll have to deal with the fact that not only did they not have the creativity to make their own game , but they could not even use the success of the game that was their predecessor to create a successful game in their own right . Sonic Shuffle is a textbook example of this.The game boards are pointless and poorly conceived . The story behind the game is uninspiring , and does not catch the imagination . The minigames are stupid , and not entertaining in the least.I would avoid this game at all costs , unless you want to give someone free money for a useless piece of software . Or maybe you could use the CD as a designer coaster or something .	-1
I got Perfect Dark for the N64 the day it came out and was actually surprised that it was better than I had expected . When I saw the same title for Gameboy , I figured it would be a portable version of the great N64 game.Boy , was I wrong . This is easily the worst game I own . The controls do n't work , the sound is n't good , and the game play is horrible . Almost entirely the opposite of what the N64 game was . In fact , really the only thing in common between the two is the title and main character.In short , if you liked the N64 version , do n't bother with this game . If you hated the N64 version , I suppose you might like this .	-1
There is nothing perfect about this game , so that right there is false advertising . Anyway , how fun can a game be that allows you to get shot from an enemy who is shooting you while rushing in from off screen ? Sound fun ? Well , no , it 's not . Gameboy color games are pretty weak across the board ... I 'd stick to the Advance . Perfect Dark is just [ mindless ] .	-1
When the Transfer Pak was initially introduced for the Nintendo 64 , there were very few games that used it . Pok & eacute ; mon Stadium and Mario Gold ( see reviews ) were the first ones , and Mario Tennis was coming . At the time , I had recently bought Perfect Dark for the N64 , and I 'd heard that the GBC version would use the Transfer Pak . Based on that , I bought the GBC game . Oops.My first mistake was expecting an N64-type experience from this game , and that 's simply not possible . Perfect Dark was so good for the N64 that it could n't be translated well for the Game Boy . However , it could still be a good game in its own right . Well , it 's not.The controls , to say the least , are poor . It 's difficult to aim , difficult to tell where you 're aiming , hard to tell what 's happening , hard to see where items are to pick up . It 's just difficult to play . I could n't even force myself to go through the first level.The sound is nothing spectacular , and while the cut scenes are interesting , the graphics themselves are poor . The cartridge also comes with a built-in Rumble feature , but that really does n't add anything to the game other than weight.I ca n't recommend this game in any way , even for its ability to unlock features in the N64 game ( which I could n't find in the GBC manual and will accept on faith ) . It 's simply not worth it . If you need to get into things in the N64 version , find some cheat codes on-line and save yourself some money .	-1
This is by far one of the most boring RTS games I have ever played , and I have played alot of them.Just like in most RTS games , you have to collect resources . I spent most of my time waiting for the resource collectors to bring the resource . It was so boring . The single player mission was spent over half the time waiting . Waiting for resources . Waiting for your ships to build . Waiting for researches to finish.The graphics were ok , but given the fact this was a 1999 game , I can see where the graphics would have been pretty good though I believe Total Annihilation , Starcraft , and especially Age Of Empires ( which all 3 came out before Homeworld ) looked better . The ships looked cool , but if you zoomed in on them , they looked pixally . And the cutscenes were just ok . It was cool to be able to see a 360 view of every ship though.The battles were n't anything spectacular . You could n't really see of hear any of the fighting going on . Just the same droning music over and over ( the music was cool the first few missions , but gets rather boring later ) . It was also impossible to follow the battles as your camera follows one of units or the other.The best thing about this game was the story . The story goes like this : A spaceship was found buried in sand here on Earth . Using that technology and the history found on the ship , they built their own ships so that they could head to their real Homeworld . As the story unfolds and new enemies and friends are made , the story keeps this game going . At least for me , that is the only reason I continued to play this game.I read all of the reviews on many gamesites including Gamespot and Gamespy and many of the reviews here , and maybe my expectations were high , but one review said that no has since done what homeworld has done . And I believe the reason is who would want to . The idea about completely 3D space game is good in concept , but it takes away from the gameplay too much . This is definitely nothing like the games I mentioned before , but having played over 50 RTS games , this one did n't do it for me.Next up is Homeworld Cataclysm . I bought all 3 Homeworld games at the same time because the price was cheap . So I do n't feel like I was cheated too much . Game was n't for me , but maybe it is for you .	-1
i bougfht this game with great expectations , but i did n't like it in the least bit , its got an awsoem story lien and greta gameplay , i just do n't liek 3drts , to you 2d rts fans , this is nothing liek a 2d rts , i found it very boring , and extremely annoying how the veiw system works..	-1
Having just played Homeworld and not really enjoying it , I tried this one , the second game in the series ( I bought all 3 at the same time . Should n't have done that . ) And so far , I ca n't even get the game to play . I installed and uninstalled twice . I have downloaded updated drivers for NVIDIA GEFORCE FX 5200 128meg video card . I have changed all of the settings over and over again . And still ca n't play . I see the beginning story in the aftermath that follows the end of Homeworld , of them rebuilding . But as soon as I see the ship fly in on the first cutscene , I get kicked back to Windows.My recommedation is if you have XP , do n't get this game . So far , it 's more trouble than it 's worth . So now I guess I will try Homeworld 2 .	-1
Well , somehow they managed to make a follow-up that is not as good as the first.Please note that the people who made this sequal are NOT the people who made the original , even though Sierra handles the production.Pay attention to the negative reviews this game has received , many fans of the original feel a bit betrayed by this one.Yes , there are some tweaks that are good : waypoints for movement , you can make vessels fly around in circles , some different ships.However this game does NOT have the magnificent ambience of the original , the voice overs are sickeningly American-accented , it simply does not have anywhere near the class and atmosphere of the first.Do n't get me wrong , it is a good game and if you are starving for more Homeworld then go for it , but do n't expect the beauty of the original.If you do not have Homeworld , GET HOMEWORLD . It 's better to enjoy the original first . You wo n't lose anything by playing that one first . Then play a demo of this one , and if you can stomach it , go for it.Sierra , get your act together and make some cheap original Homeworld mission packs , thanks , that would be well appreciated .	-1
I bought this game because I used to play it when I was young , and I loved it . I was so upset that it did not work when I received it .	-1
This game gets boring after an hour or two . The interface is a bit confusing at the beginning .	-1
Step into the real world with a new and highly competitive version of Monopoly . This is not competitive like you roll the dice , see where you land , buy the property , then build houses once you get a monopoly . This is a game where at any given second you can lease a property from the city ( where then it goes to auction instead of you just buying it ) or you can build a residential or retail area without owning the land ( you just rent it ) . It makes for some interesting things , such as someone will build lots of buildings on rented land , then another player will buy the land out from under them . Once you start enjoying the game , then it unfortunately ends , because this game goes in scenarios , not full-length games ( like playing a demo that cuts off after 10 minutes ) . Its also very tedious , because it & # 65533 ; s the same city over and over , so you basically go build the same stuff over and over . The scenarios sound basic ( make 100 sales , earn $ 3000 profit in one day , reach an empire of $ 20,000 , have the most money by 1945 ) , but they are difficult at times because the game does not offer insights as to how to complete the scenarios . There are nice smooth 3D graphics to the game , but the tools to create buildings are troublesome .	-1
Let me explain this game ... . however bizzare it may be.Basicly you are some business tycoon building shops , renting different businesses , and getting rich . Perhaps some 60 yr old retired business man may enjoy this , but definately not the general public.However , it still has a good side ... . starting shops , apartments , ect.. but that becomes boring and repetitive after about 1-2 hours . Definately not worth more than $ 5	-1
man , roller coaster tycoon is awesome , but this is like a piece of junk . who would want to but this ?	-1
grandprix 3 is simply one of the worst racing sim I have ever played . One of the most important points in setting up a formula one car is the camber , ajustment , which is missing in this game . Mr. Geoff Crammond , what on earth were you thinking about . The only level I can beat these racers is the rookie level , you see I drag race for about 10 years , and I know how a car is suppose to handle.I use all kinds of input devices , and the steering from the center position , is way off . I had to add the 1.13 patch in order to get the main buttons on my input device to work . The % of damage done to vehicles is ridiculous . All of the gamers that think this is real formula one racing is either stupid , or unaware of how formula one racing is done . I will suggest to the gamers that think this is a great game is simple : The next time formula one racing appears on t.v . : LOOK AT IT PLEASE . To all formula one racing gamers , let me give you the names of three fantastic F1 games # 1=Official formula one racing , by Eidos Interactive # 2= F1 2000 by electronic arts , # 3= F1 2001 , by electronic arts . Now , not one of these f1 sims are as real , as the real thing , because thats impossible , But , the three games I refer to are the most realistic , trust me , PEACE : I do n't believe in stepping on any body toes , but I believe in telling the truth , thank you ;	-1
One of the biggest mistakes of my life was purchasing this travesty of computer programming . It runs terribly , and I have a new 533 system . The time frame is not paced , and the options are not as smooth as the package promotes . Bad production indeed ! And the biggest factor that it fails to anywhere close to fun .	-1
I am not much of a game expert , but I do know what I like to play . I decided I wanted the game because the concept of running my own airport would be fun . I even read a few of the reviews on amazon . My husband seen the game at [ local store ] including in a pack with other games . He only paid [ some money ] for the pack and I see why . First the box said airport tycoon , but the cd saids Air Mogul . I guess it is the same game . When I first seen the graphics it was awful . I still thought there would be hope . The game play is not easy to understand and the game tutorial was worthless in fact it was mess up itself . I just did n't like it at all . I was very disappointed . So if you are just a person who like to play games just for the fun of it , and not one of those hard gamers do n't waste your money on this game . It was n't even worth a few dollars . Now one of the other games in the pack I am currently playing is RailRoad Tycoon 2 and it was definitely worth the few dollars .	-1
This game is very difficult for beginners to pickup . After playing the home version with the DC controler I realized how much I miss those twin sticks . Trying to get use to the controls takes a very long time and the pay off is n't worth it.Graphics are only as good as the arcade version ( perfect port of the arcade visually ) , which is now dated.Hardcore Virtual On fans seem to like it a lot , everyone else should pass . There are better rewarding games that take less time to figure out . Oh yeah , where is the Internet play Activision ?	-1
... Being a fan of the legendary Chrono Trigger , I was enthralled by the coming of this game . `` Chrono Cross '' is actually not a true sequel ( as said by the creators ) , but originally a game called `` Radical Dreamers . '' Anywho , this game DID NOT live up to my expectations at all . Read on to see why.THE GOODFirst of all , the graphics are actually quite colorful . The backgrounds are well colored and animated . The battle graphics also flow quite well . Even if some of the characters are not all that great , they are nicely created . However , these are the only good points I can say about the game.THE BADAbout the characters : there are about 40 characters jammed into this game and they virtually have no personality . It 's like the creators wanted to boast about the character quantity as opposed to MEMORABLE , AWESOME characters that we play the game for . Who cares about 40 characters ? ! The music : The remixes of Yasnuori Mitsuda 's themes from CT are actually excellent , but the rest of the game 's music is strictly mediocre . Quite a shame , considering the same musical composers from CT are here . The battle system many have boasted about is not that great at all ; You virtually do n't even level up . It 's pretty much a Final Fantasy Materia/Xenogears combination of a battle system , but it comes off very heavyhanded ( not to mention the colors are annoying ) .THE UGLYThe critical point about this game is the fact that it does n't really transcend well into CT . The Glenn here is NOT Frog ( as many have said ) , and is a very vindictive character that we quickly dismiss . Schala was VERY MESSED UP at the end of the game , being blonde and in different physical shape . Lavos was supposedly killed in CT and yet , he somehow survives ... something which the game does n't even explain it well at all . Which leads to the worst part about the game : the storyline . What could 've been a unique storyline is muddled by inconsistencies and loopholes ( examples : humans evolved after apes , BUT in CT , the people were human LONG BEFORE Lavos entered Earth ; Lucca supposedly gave up her purpose in life , that is creating machines , to be the head of an orphanage , which goes against Lucca 's character . She also talks about regrets , which contrasts the more confident Lucca from CT ; The game states that Guardia was destroyed and the Masamune was stolen , but why even bother when it does n't even appear as ruins in the game ? ? ) .AND THE ULTIMATE SIN ... Robo appears in the game VERY BRIEFLY , and once you find him , he dies ! He was my favorite character in CT ( in a close race with Frog ) and killing him off like a worthless character was the ultimate sin . Speaking of Frog , the game assumes that he died and the Masamune was stolen from him.OVERALLIf you take away the references to CT , it does n't hurt nearly as much , but it 's still a rather generic RPG . RPG fanatics no doubt love this game ( which is why this game is very overrated ) and I would 've given it three stars . However , since it blatantly defies the CT legend with a muddled storyline , unappealing characters , merely average music , and just for being VASTLY OVERRATED ... this game does n't deserve anything above 2 stars . You 'll hate me for this , but I demand that an RPG has a decent storyline , a decent battle system , and appealing characters . This game fails in all three departments . ONLY GET THIS GAME IF YOU 'RE AN RPG FANATIC . Otherwise , pass it on , ESPECIALLY if you are a fan of the classic Chrono Trigger.On a closing note , do n't get me wrong , people ; The majority of Squaresoft 's games are excellent . The point I am trying to make ( by the statement at the very beginning ) is that there are TOO MANY fans out there that are blindly devoted to the company ; they make hits and misses like everyone else . Fortunately , this is one of their few misses .	-1
Please promise me you will never play this . It is not worth your time . If you paid money for it , try to find the person you gave that money to and kick them in the shin . Hard . Then throw your copy of this game in the dumpster.Seriously though , this game is absolutely terrible . The graphics are bad even for the PSX , the combat quickly becomes boring as all hell , the story line was confused and the fact that there was a second dimension pointless . There was no reason for there being 40 something characters , most of them were exactly the same statwise , and all of them were poorly designed . The most annoying thing in the world , bar nothing , is having to re-equip all your character 's spells whenever you switch characters . You have like 50 spell slots . God . I do n't think I even need to say it , but those crumbums at Square could n't pull another hit out of their oversized victorian tophats if they wanted too . They should really stick with straight to video Final Fantasy 7 anime movies from now on , lest they risk making something like this again .	-1
This game falls short when it comes as a sequel to the illustrious Chrono Trigger . The weaknesses/strengths with this sequel are as follows : Story & amp ; Characters : No connection is made to Chrono Trigger until well into the game , also very few characters from the original CT are mentioned , or shown . Espeically the sorceror Magus ( you do see a passing mention to his real name in a letter to Kid , thats it , o and he may be one of two guys in the game ) , not too mention they got his sister Schala 's face structure and skin color ALL wrong at the end . Also the first ending is quite weak and dumb.The 40 character roster is ridiculous , having this many characters stresses quantity rather than quality . Many of the 40+ characters have no personality ( besides an accent or odd way of speaking ) or story or plot threads behind them . Most of the characters in this game have no individuality.The sory is somewhat confusing ( as well as the two Dimensions , see below ) as its hard to keep straight what happens between the two nearly-identical worlds.On Dimensional Travel : The dimensional travel back and forth between worlds would of been great , that is if Square would of put at least a little bit of distinction between the two worlds so they do not look nearly identical ( perhaps give different continental shapes as in the first CT ) . This adds for a lot of confusion when you are completing tasks when going back and forth between worlds.Levels & amp ; Magic : Instead of leveling up ( like in normal RPGs ) you gain stars for defeating bosses . So the game leaves you wondering if you ever got stronger at all or if you ever will . Also magic is not learned it is assigned by & quot ; color & quot ; . And this gives the game even more of a completist & quot ; pokemon & quot ; feel ( not too mention the 40+ characters ) by classifying the characters all by color , again ruining any chance of individuality between characters . About the only individuality characters have are different tech skills.Sound & amp ; Music : The opening , well-orchestrated theme & quot ; Scar Of Time & quot ; will blow you away . The other music in this game is very well done , some of it being slight remixes or remade versions of music in the original CT ( except this time its played with real instruments and not synthesized ) . There is one point in the game however where you will want to turn down the volume . Although accompanient lacks in some areas ( like the acoustic guitar themes ) the sound overall is great.Graphics & amp ; Animation : Absolutely breathtaking ! The animation for the spells during battle are well detailed and flow very smoothly , this section along with the sound are the game 's strong points.The game for a hardcore CT player ( I swear I played Chrono Trigger so much I had every detail memorized ) is somewhat below average . For one thing there are too many characters ( keeping it at 10 max would of been fine ) , secondly this game was developed to begin with not as a sequel to CT but rather for a Japanese Satellite System called BS where players in Japan can play together ( it was called Radical Dreamers back then ) , and many of the developers and designers said in interviews it is not a true CT sequel ( if we are lucky the loyal CT fans might see a real sequel , we can dream cant we ? ) .The bottom line is if you never played CT you 'll enjoy this game . But if you are like me and were expecting a good sequel to a great game youll be disappointed like me , for some of the many reasons Ive stated above .	-1
I have played almost every rpg ever made for almost all systems , thats how long I 've been a gamer and Chrono Trigger will always be in my top five , not for the story but just for sure fun-factor and inventiveness . In hindsight , I do n't actually believe Chrono Trigger is nearly good as I once did when I was a kid , but it still blows this game out of the water.I did n't hate this game either , do n't get me wrong , but its just not there . The graphics for the time were amazing I suppose and the battle system is different ( often to the point of annoyance ) , but different is n't always good . They tried to create a plotline as lofty and intricate as something like Xenogears . You go to so many places and meet WAAAAAAY too many party members to the point where they all seem to lose their respective `` face . '' You only really need the first two main party members and then pick one more from the other gazillion to form your party . Honestly , I thought the choice to add so many potential members was quite stupid . Also , I feel the storyline is too confusing . Havign beat this game a few years ago I remember almost nothing of what actually happened except for the fact I had already forgotten about most of it before I was even doen with the game , which usually does n't mark a very enthralling affair in my eyes.Many people love this game , and I suppose if you try to play it as a game set apart from the Chrono `` franchise , '' as it were , it is a fair stand-alone outing . The Chrono tag is merely a means to an end , however , it is there to sell the game . This game has nothing to do with the original except in name and the use of timetravel . I would not recommend this game as a good rpg to start off on if you 've never played one before . If you want the best of the best rpg 's then go pick up Persona 3 , FF7/FFX/FFXII , Xenogears , Star Ocean , or Suikoden 2/3/5 , to name a few . This one can easily be bypassed .	-1
this game looks good , and the story is great but the game does not deliver the goods . The problem I have most with the game is serge the main character never talks , that is just plain lazyness you just get the feeling that serge is just lifeless and is not intristing at all . Since the game has so many characters in it , it seems that most of the other characters as lifeless as serge and have no pointe in ever bieng introduced to the plot.I feel thair is a limit to the number of characters in a game that will still make the game intristing . And I am sorry Game Informer , but this game does not restore my faith in the modern RPG ( you have to read thair great magazine to know what I am talking about ) Square could do better , I have seen it done .	-1
The game played but it was unable to save a file without corrupting it every time so that was b.s .	-1
battery screw up made me sad I forgot to read that , game plays like it should . brings back the olden days , they need to do remakes for the new consols but as long as we can fix it at home with a new battery we will keep playing them !	-1
This game has an extensive bunch of moves , maneuvers , special items , secrets and it has a huge amount of Spiderman memorabilia in it . This is a very detailed Spiderman game because it is a whole 3D world , you as Spiderman or one of his six playable alter egos can swing from building to building , hang upside-down , create a web shield , web the band guys or create web boxing gloves . Everyone is included , like Venom , Carnage , the Scorpion , Rhino , and a 50 ft Mysterio . You must beat them each in a unique way , rather than just beating them up . There are twenty-five levels , however , the big downfall is that you can beat the game from beginning to end in only two or three hours , which makes it like a movie . To add playability to the game you can pick up secret outfits , characters , 3D profiles on bad guys and even comicbook covers documenting the history of the comic .	-1
Graphics look ok , sound 's ok , but I for one do not wish to spend a few hours studying the manual before being able to play a game . And even then it 's a drag to input all your commands and having to return all your troops and credits to the staging area at the end of each mission !	-1
I bought this game after trying the demo , which seemed pretty neat . However , after playing Ground Control , this game seems constricting , boring and ... forgive me ... depressing . Allow me to explain.First , the graphics engine , although good looking , does not allow for full camera freedom . This means that you are limited to a top down view of the battle , unlike the far superior Ground Control where you can look wherever you want to . I personally find this quite limiting , especially considering you ca n't zoom out far enough to make any sort of real strategy or troop movements easily.Also , the whole environment of the game , from the music to the seemingly omnipresent fog to the rain to the plot to the night , is just depressing . It does n't make you WANT to play . I found myself slaving through another boring and overly long mission just to see some new technology , one of the cool parts of the game , and eventually I just gave up and moved on . There are some great lighting and weather effects , but I really do n't think the atmosphere is condusive to fun gameplay.In short : If you 're looking for a great , fun , beautiful 3D RTS , buy Ground Control . This game just is n't worth the effort .	-1
I 'm an avid FPS ( first person shooter ) fan , and I was very much looking forward to playing Tribes 2 . I 'd read many glowing reviews and heard lots of buzz about the game . Unfortunately , after three separate attempts to get through the tutorial , I was hopelessly bored with the game and annoyed with the physics engine.Bottom line is that this is a complex game that is probably a lot of fun for people who are big into teamplay and resource management , but if you 're a die-hard shooter fan like me , I think you 'll find that this game 's lack of polish and emphasis on complexity is not your cup of tea .	-1
If you have a Voodoo card ( do n't believe the box which says it is 3dfx compatable ) , do n't buy this game regardless of your machine specs . I am using a Voodoo5500 and I am lucky if I get 20fps out of it ( not unplayable , but not worth it either ) . The game is so fogged in , that you might as well be playing indoors . It does play ok over the internet though . If you have an Nvidia card ( Geforce , Geforce2 , TNT ) you will probably have better luck . I really liked the first Tribes and thought this one would follow in its footsteps .	-1
I will give an honest review and personal opinion that makes sense . I love playing these first person shooter games and I play things like Unreal Tournament and counter-strike and rogue spear most frequently . I was expecting a great game from what I read on reviews and from word of mouth on the internet ( can you really trust it ? ) . I have a P3-667 Mhz with 128 MB of RAM using a Voodoo5500 AGP card . The game runs pretty decent going on 800x600 ( 16-bit ) on Direct3D mode . However , OpenGL is a different story . Even on 640x480 , it was really choppy and unplayable . Although the graphics looked superb in OpenGl , this game is a machine hog , as everyone has stated earlier . This game sort of reminds me of Team Fortress Classic and how everyone needs to work together . Problem is , nobody does . Everyone just runs around shooting and killing anything . I played on several servers and there is no team work as people mention about . Even though it 's a team based game , team work is not there because everyone wants a piece of there own action . So it was not fun in that sense . The weapons , to me personally , are like 'whatever ' . They just shoot plasma , lasers , rocket , etc.. and you just hit people . People are just flying and driving vehicles everywhere and turrets are firing everywhere . For some reason , this game just was n't fun . Sure , I got the hang of the game farely quick , but I found myself wanting to play Counter-Strike instead . The thrill is just not there as in Counter-strike . As for technical problems - none for me . Everyone else , on [ ... ] on the forum have so many problems . But I have not seen any serious problems on my computer . My personal recommendation is to wait for this game to drop in price and get Counter-strike , if you have n't done so all ready .	-1
I do n't know why Sierra really bother to repack Half-Life in yet ANOTHER version ! What else are they going to do ? A Halflife Pack with Counterstrike , Day of Defeat , and Action all in one ? This is a waste ! A waste of time and money , for Sierra and the consumers ! I 'm only talking about the product , Counter-Strike is actually not a bad mod , since about 90 % of the Half-Life gaming community plays it , there is no room for other mods . This is bad for the people that are tired of Counterstrike and are looking for something new.Buying Half-Life by itself is cheaper , you can download Counterstrike for free anyway .	-1
Counter-Strike is a spectacular mod for a spectacular game . Half-Life , though somewhat outdated now , is still one of the best FPS games ever made . The gameplay is superb , and the mods that have spawned from the game are great in their own right . Counter-Strike is one of those great mods . Counter-Stike is so great , that Sierra decided to sell a retail version of the game . This is why I am giving this only one star , in spite of the spectacularness of the game . Go to pretty much any website where games can be downloaded , and you can get this game , provided you have Half-Life , for free . Yes for free . The file however , is fairly large , but even so , it is probably worse to buy a game you can get for free than it is to leave a slow internet connection on all night so you can get this game . Basically , this game is great , and though it is worth the price , it is still available for free , so that price is n't worth it .	-1
I give credit to the graphics but this game is no different then most Multiplayers ... I played this at a computer/arcade place er what ever there called nd I did n't like the game that much ... The gameplay is alright but Nothing special ... .BUT IT IS FUN WHEN YOU 'RE PLAYING WITH FRIENDS I CAN TELLYOU THAT But over all it 's very overrated ...	-1
I 'll make this short and sweet for you . I went to a cyber cafe so I can play this `` gem '' and see what all the fuss is about on this game . OVERRATED . I have no idea how people prais this as `` THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD ! ! `` ... How silly , This game is just plain average.. If you wan na play a nice Game from Valve..I do n't need to tell you but I 'll give you a hint ... .H***f L*fe ... This game is just pure garbage and the Online is boring ... And I do n't need your flaming or bashing just cause One mans opinion differs from yours..The goodVisuals are good I guessBadVery MediocerPlain boring combat ... Nothing newOnline is n't that greatExtreamly Overrated ... TRUST ME..Gets boring after awhileAnd yes I played this out for more then an 1hour ... 2 bucks I 'll never get back2.1 out of 5 stars ... . Extreamly Overrated , Not worth my 2 bucks , and that 's all I got to say ... .Peace	-1
First , let me say that I whole-hearedly agree with the review by Tiberius . Back in the glory days of Counter-Strike ( 2001-2002 ) , this game was the be-all end-all for 1 ) Online video games , 2 ) First-Person Shooters , 3 ) PC Games , and 4 ) Any video game basically . It had real-life weapons , the graphics were superb at the time , the maps were extremely well-made , the system requirements are still obscenely low , and damnit it was fun . Then , inevitabely , the hands of time began to take their ruthless , indiscriminate toll . Video cards supported better graphics , new ( and yes , better ! ) games came out ( Battlefield 1942 , Unreal Tournament 2004 ) , hacking became the unmistakable poison of Counter-Strike , and a lot of the cool , casual gamers grew up or moved on . From 2000 to 2004 , Counter-Strike went from an utter joy to a sensation to a fading diamond to a nuisance . By 2004 to present day , it has become a problem . Great games and great game developers are losing tons of money because people are still playing this game after five years on their mom 's worn-out 640 Megahertz Pentium III PCs running Windows 98 . Counter-Strike is still one of the most popular games of all-time , with a ridiculous number of people playing it on average a day , because people just do n't seem to have enough self-control to give up their hopeless addiction.Today , server admins are , for the most part , humorless dictators , and will not stand for anything that deviates from this game 's undeniable , monotonous drone . People are still playing the same maps from the 1.0 release , that have completely lost all their zest and initial potential . It always feels as if I 've played the same round a thousand times before , and I probably have . Even the custom maps are sickening in their monotony . fy_iceworld is fun for 3 consecutive seconds . Many other popular custom maps in heavy server rotation are the same way , and all look disguisting . I 've played on probably over 500 servers , and downloaded probably over the same amount of *quality* custom maps , and not more than 3 have I ever seen a server run in its rotation , or voted on by the players . Furthermore , people are still playing the game using dial-up , and CS veterans are always complaining about camping , even if its a tactic used to complete the objective . As far as the objectives are concerned , Counter-Strike has basically become a deathmatch game . No one will listen to anyone 's plan ( on the rare occasion there is one ) , no one tries to rescue the hostages , and everyone always calls someone a `` p***y '' or `` nub '' if you use the auto shotgun or AWP . And to top it all off , Valve cancelled the outstanding won.net and replaced it with this Steam garbage , a utility soaking wet with incompetence.L337 Speak has also gained mass popularity to the jaded Counter-Strike culture , and has become its own incessant frustration . But I wo n't even get into that . If you 're new to CS , do n't bother , veterans of this game are far from friendly , and you 'll probably get called a bunch of names involving lots of zeroes and threes if you 're a beginner . For now , if you want to indulge yourself in a great online game , check out World of Warcraft , Battlefield 1942 , Sven Co-Op , or even Team Fortress Classic ( a dated game with an *awesome* community that has yet to lose its initial charm ) .	-1
Whoa , were do I start.This game was by FAR the worst turok game EVER.The graphics are horrible ( except for the talking ) , caracters from previous turoks come back and look COMPLEATLY different . I mean , not even remotly close.The sound is okay.The music is all the same though.Lets see , gameplay.The AI is horible . The enemy stands there and shoots at you.Unlike its previous game , where the Dinosoids would hide behind crates and throw grenades , or self distruct , ect.The guns are like worse versions of T2s guns . The only gun I like is the hardest gun to get.The story line is bland . Nothing really happens . It has nothing to do with all the othe turok games . All of a sudden , things just happen.Over all , it seems the game had a lack of intrest when they made it . Notice Iguana ( who made the other two turok games ) didnt make this one . Tells you something just by that .	-1
RR V came with my PS2 bundle so I ca n't say I wasted money on it . I was just happy to finally get a PS2 . Anyway , the graphics are amazing as you would come to expect on the PS2 platform . The music is fantastic . There are some awesome techno tracks . The car selection is cool . You can even choose a little modified Honda Civic Hatchback . I have played this game for about two months , off and on as I get bored with my sports games ( madden , fifa , etc ... ) and it is decent . I am not a big car racing person so I guess my review is a little more negative than most but this one just has more negatives than positives . I hate the following : 1 ) The announcer is lame . The whole deal is some radio DJ announcing the race coverage in a & quot ; So Cal & quot ; voice . I thought I had one of the members of Blink 182 in my TV ... Dude ! 2 ) The steering sucks . I like to have a car that hugs the curves not one that slides around like a pig in mud on a rainy day in July . 3 ) The car never gets damaged . I hit a wall going 110 and the car just slides off ... wish my real car did that . 4 ) The game is hard , but hey I already told you I am not into car games . I will take you on in Madden any day of the week ! My advise : Rent before you buy !	-1
I really wanted to try ridge racer , so one day I picked it up at my local gamestop and I was excited to play it , what I experienced was one of the most boring , unoriginal , frustrating racing experiences I have ever had . The game is so boring , there is nothing unique about this game . Let me compare this to my favorite racing game F-Zero GX , yah sure F-Zero GX was hard but hot damn it is amazing , a wide variety of vehicals to play with , unique tracks incredible speed and hand sweating action , ridge racer 5 on the other hand is boring , a boring selection of cars , a boring selection of tracks , all in all its just really lazy . AND DONT GET ME STARTED ON THE RACING ITSELF , this is one of those games if you fall back in last place , THERE IS NOT CHANCE TO GET BACK TO FIRST , the AI is terrible , they always get ahead of you , and you cant get ahead of them . This makes an already boring game frustrating . In F-Zero GX even though the game has insane level design you still at least had a chance to catch up because you know , the game is fast . Ridge Racer 5 is slow , and boring , and frustrating , its not even worth a damn penny.F-Zero GX	-1
I got this on the cheap thinking that it would be a decent racing game . I was wrong . I did n't know what to expect , but cars that handle EXTREMELY unrealistically , graphics that are just average in my eyes ( compared to NFS 2 Hot pursuit and GT 3 ) and a general unexpected hardness in gameplay made me sorry I got this game . The cars are fake , which is n't too much of an issue but you have to make the fake cars good . If you 're looking for a fun racing game with realistic cars , go for Need For Speed 2 : Hot Pursuit , and if you want a good driving sim , go for Gran Turismo 3 . Rent this if you must , but do n't spend a lot of money for it .	-1
This game was just a reminder to me why I switched from Ridge Racer to Gran Turismo . The graphics are decent especially in the replay but thats it . The controls are horrible and if the announcer would show himself on the track I would gladly run over him . The game itself has 14 courses ( that includes the reverse ) and 18 different cars . But there are only 2 different views to choose from . When I bought this I was excited and thought it was the racing game that was going to hold me over till Gran Turismo 3 comes out but I was wrong .	-1
The RR series has always been sort of self-explanatory . Realistic looking cars in a realistic environment , but playing like an arcade racer . No great amount of depth ( like the Gran Turismo series ) but not quite as cartoony as Beetle Adventure Racing or Top Gear Overdrive.This is just more of the same . Is it the best looking RR ever ? Yeah , and it should be , given that its the only PS2 version of the bunch . And , truth be told , it should look better . It does score above-average marks in the style department , but the highly Japanese flavor to it might turn off some gamers . Basically it is what it is : another Ridge Racer game . Type 4 was good for PSX , and a lot of people expected more from this one , but did n't get & quot ; the next level & quot ; of RR games , just another in a series.If you want a decent racing game , wait for Gran Turismo 3 , or if you 've been a RR devotee , then by all means go for this one . For most gamers it 's a & quot ; been there , done that & quot ; kinda thing .	-1
When i first got this it was hard . Then i played it more and more , I used the slowest car and i beet the game in about 3-4 hours . The game is to short , when you beet it all you have are the time attacks and the races were you try to beet a fake computer guys ( time attack ) .And how the hell do you get medls !	-1
After the very classic Super NES title & quot ; Super Castlevania IV , & quot ; Konami released another Super NES game in the form of & quot ; Dracula X. & quot ; I 'm not sure whether the Genesis game & quot ; Bloodlines & quot ; preceded it or not , so I 'm not going to make any judgments in terms of which came first . I will , however , state that Bloodlines is a FAR better game than this ... thing . It 's extremely rare nowadays and for good reason . Here 's the lowdown : THE GOODThe graphics are VERY GOOD FOR THE SYSTEM . They are ALMOST , OH SO CLOSE to the graphics represented in Playstation 's & quot ; Symphony of the Night. & quot ; I 'm not kidding . Unlike some other reviewers , I liked the level designs ; they were n't perfect , but they certainly were n't terrible . Unfortunately , these are practically the only two things I can say positive about the game . Wait , three things : It 's rare , so many people did n't waste their money with this . Ha . Did n't think I 'd find another one , did you ? THE BADOh man , with so much potential you 'd think this would be a classic with its storyline that links to Symphony and its high-quality graphics and level design . The bad comes crashing down on this one ; you play as Richter Belmont ( like in Symphony ) , but the whip does n't twirl around ( it only stays straight ) AND IT NEVER UPGRADES OR CHANGES WHEN YOU DIE . I could 've spared this game some dignity with the lack of movement for the whip , but why did they make it to where it 's always the same ? ! That 's going against Castlevania tradition ! You 've always been able to change your whip and why this game does n't is beyond me . Also , the music is very subpar , mostly consisting of rambling techno noise and heavy metal-ish music ( which normally would 've pleased me ... ) that does n't really go anywhere . Richter also walks VERY SLOWLY , almost like the Game Boy titles , and the jumping is horrid here . It 's almost as bad as controlling your character in the N64 Castlevania 's . I ca n't emphasize how bad this is . BAD , BAD , BAD.OVERALLI HIGHLY -DO NOT- RECOMMEND THIS . I 'm a huge Castlevania fan and I even know not to buy this game . If you do buy it , get it for a decent price . I saw this store have it for 80 bucks with a torn label AND CARTRIDGE ONLY . My friends , Super Castlevania IV was FAR BETTER than this piece of plastic . Ultimately , this game had great potential but it comes off as rushed and uninspired . I hate to bash on a Castlevania game , but I had to.I also noticed ( and apparently reviewer Ted did as well ) that many Castlevania fans seemed to like this over Bloodlines . I ca n't fathom a reason why since Bloodlines is a better game . Sometimes , you people make me sick .	-1
In 1993 on the Turbo Grafx-16 in Japan , they released a Castlevania game called Akumaj & # 333 ; Dracula X Chi no Rondo . Translated that 's : Demon Castle Dracula X Rondo of Blood . The game is a direct prequel to the 1997 all time best : Symphony of the Night . Unfortunately , in 1995 when Dracula X came out to the Super Nintendo entertainment system , the game was greatly altered from the original japanese version . In other words , this is n't the original Dracula X , but a different version , and one that 's far inferior to the original.You play as Richter Belmont who is out to battle with Dracula . It is up to the Belmont clan to keep ridding the world of Dracula , and now it 's Richter 's time to shine . The game opens up in Transylvania , the very first stage of the game . All the classic Castlevania things are here . You wield a whip -- the Vampire Killer -- as well as having a set of Sub-weapons . A knife , axe , holy cross , and holy water just to name a few . You can use these sub-weapons by collecting hearts . Anyone who has played a Castlevania game probably knows all this stuff.Dracula X is one of the games that 's fairly simple to pick up and play . The controls are by no means hard to learn , and the mechanics are also by no means hard to learn . It all comes to you pretty easily . There are some parts of the gameplay that were used in Castlevania IV however , that just did n't get into Dracula X , though . For example , your control over the whip is limited . In many installments of the series you can usually let the whip dangle and you can manipulate it the way you want . That 's gone in Dracula X . The only thing you can do with the whip is swing it . You ca n't let it dangle and control it.Where the game really hits a low point though is the flow of the gameplay . This game is unreasonably challenging . And it is n't due to your enemies being tough , it 's done by some unfair game physics and level designs . Let 's get it out of the way , most level designs are horrendous . Partly due to the jumping physics of the game . When you jump you do n't really have a whole lot of control , and Richter always jumps at an angle . There are some platforms where you have to be literally one step from falling off before you can jump to actually make some . Likewise , each time you sustain damage from certain enemies you 're knocked back . Most of your deaths will not come from simply losing all of the health in your health gauge . They 'll come because you just landed from a jump , only to have a enemy pop up from no where and knock you back into a pit . This would n't be so bad if it were n't such a frequent occurrence . The frustration from this is enough to deduce the fun factor by large margins.And some enemies really are tough , particularly some of the games bosses that do an insane amount of damage . Overall , though , most levels are designed for enemies to take advantage of knocking you in a pit . Other levels are designed to frustrate you to get to the end . There are some levels where you 'll spend so much time redoing jumping exercises or falling back into areas you 've already visited simply because the levels are terribly designed . It 's annoying , and let 's not even go into the frustration shared in the final battle with Dracula.To the game 's credit , though , the music and graphics are top notch . The music is among some of the best on the Super Nintendo , but that 's certainly not enough to warrant the game a buy . The graphics are also really good looking . Almost as good as 1997 's Symphony of the Night , and for a 2D side-scroller made in 1995 , that 's not bad at all . The look of the levels is grand as are the enemies and backgrounds . Still , the fact that the game is `` shiny '' just ca n't warrant it a buy . It 's by far one of the weakest Castlevania games in the series , and it 's due in large part to physics and level designs that will frustrate the gamer to no end . A huge disappointment for any Castlevania fan .	-1
This was a let down indeed , all graphics nothing more . The controls are downright horrible , you ca n't use your whip multi-directional like you could with ( CASTLEVANIA BLOODLINES AND SUPER CASTLEVANIA ) and he walks slow in this game , even the special double requires you to mash the buttons . Also whats going on with all the jumping I feel like I 'm on the 8th level on Super Mario Bros , not a Castlevania game , the difficultly was unpleasant and the level design was unforgivable.In addition what who ruined the Castlevania music with this techno garbage , unless you like gay techno ( which is all techno by the way ) you will be looking for a mute button . THIS IS A RARE AND UNHEARD CASTLEVANIA FOR A REASON , IT FLATOUT STINKS , GET CASTLEVANIA BLOODLINES OR SUPER CASTLEVANIA OR EVEN S.O.T.N IF YOU HAVE A PLAYSTATION BUT AVOID DRACULA X , YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED	-1
Kirby 's Dream Course is one of the most frustrating games I have ever played . There are n't too many Kirby games I do n't like , but this is one of them ! This game is very overrated , it 's not one of Kirby 's best games . Trying to play this game makes me want to throw my controller across the room ! Graphics- 78/100The graphics have decent quality , something the rest of the game lacks.Gameplay- 20/100Replay Value- 20/100I have not played this game since I got it on Wii 's Virtual Console , so that is why Presentation and Sound scores are missing.Overall- 28/100	-1
This game is stupid ! Do n't evem think about buying this item !	-1
I 'd give this game 0 stars if that was possible . The graphics were pretty good , yes . But if you 've played one level in this game , do n't get frustrated about not getting far , they 're all the same . I played this for 5 minutes , thought wow this is cool , played it for 5 more , and realized how much it really ... ( stunk ) . Waste of $ , do n't let anybody pay you to buy it , or rent it for that matter .	-1
This game is soooooo boring i fell asleep playing it ! The only thing good about it is it 's replay feature which lets you sit and watch a firework show , but other than that this game has no objective . I never thought fireworks could be this boring .	-1
Before playing this game you should play the preceding title of the series `` The Mark of Kri '' which is a truly fantastic game . It introduces a beautiful atmospheric world , unique controls , great action , and an interesting story . One of the best title 's I 've played for the PS2.That said , I have a bone or two to pick with the sequel here . I really wanted to give this game a shining review but I have to be honest with you . For the record I found this game to be quite beautiful like MoK and the controls were very much alike . I became accustomed to fighting alongside a computer controlled ally and learned to like it . I played as the new characters and came to like them too.The painful things about this game are the bugs/glitches ! I 've played a lot of PS2 titles , I can safely say that even among the worst titles I 've played , none of them had this many bugs . What happened Sony ? Did you pull the plug on this one and rush it to store shelves ? Here 's a list of bugs I have experienced commonly in this game:1 . In stealth mode , half the time , enemies somehow magically see you when you 're completely concealed around a corner.2 . Floors disappear and stay gone during play , and make you appear as if you are walking on air . Sounds cool but it is n't . It 's sloppy.3 . Sometimes when you flip a switch and you computer ally attempts to flip it too , door jam closed instead of opening for you.4 . Your character gets stuck in a wall sometimes permanently.5 . When attempting to complete level challenges such as completing certain combos on enemies , the correctly and successfully performed combos will go undetected after dozens of attempts . ( this one really irks me ) 6 . You computer controlled partner freezes in place7 . The entire game freezes.It 's heartbreaking really . I love the series and the story but I ca n't help but get really frustrated at the sloppy programming behind this game . I expect more from Sony , especially since MoK was such a wonderful game . Try it at the very least .	-1
I thought it 's ok until the bugs start to happen very often that it just became so annoying . The game freezes alot ! This does n't happen with any of my other 50+ games , so I know my console works fine . No wonder I was able to buy this game brand new for only $ 5 ... it 's garbage !	-1
While i do like the PS 2 line up of games the system itself i have lost all confidence in.My first two PS 2 's ( the old bigger version ) died from the disc read error problem.I thought maybe in the new design this problem was addressed since the laser lens is more easily accesible and you 'd think that would make it easy to clean it and stuff.Well the new slim i bought a year ago just stopped reading discs to and i tried to clean the laser lens and it has no effect whatsoever.I have bought 3 playstation 2 's in the last 4 years.If i buy another one it will be my 4th in 4 years and will bring up my total spent on new PS 2 's to about 800 dollars.More then it costs to buy the upcoming PS 3 on a much lesser system.Conveniently they die on me after the warranty is gone.I have 200 games that are all dust collectors now cause i refuse to buy another PS 2 again.They have no durability whatsoever and the life of the systems i have owned seems to be just over a year on each.Thats not acceptable.I take good care of my systems and it does n't matter.With time the PS 2 's just stop reading discs for whatever reason.Then they want you to buy another one or ship it somewhere to be fixed ( and charge you for it of course ) .If it was an isolated thing with one faulty system i would have no problem with it.But when all three systems i buy die from the same exact problem thats not acceptable.Theres an obvious flaw in the building of this system and Sony simply refuses to address it and fix the problem where it starts in manufacturing.Because people keep flocking to the store to but them Sony wo n't bother to fix it cause as long as they see profits that translates to them as being no problem with the system.My advice is to avoid Sony console systems until they one day show they can create one with some durability.Especially with the new PS 3 , if that one ends up having the same flaw as this system its going to cost alot more to keep replacing.For the time being Sony systems are a bad investment.They just do n't have long lasting durability.My original Nintendo lasted longer then all 3 of my PS 2 's combined which is pretty sad considering that the first nintendo had a bad reputation for durability .	-1

This would be a great game , had Konami already not released five ( six when the American Idol one comes out ) better Karaoke games for the PS2 . You would think that when releasing this game in 2006 , Sony would look at its competition and make it equal or better . They did not . I apologize that so much of the review is comparing it to the Karaoke Revolution series , but it 's a natural comparison , and unfortunate for Singstar Rocks , as SR is by far an inferior product.I have a lot of the same complaints as others . There are no unlockables . Even though KR 's strange costumes are seldom used in our household , it 's nice to see things being unlocked as you sing more and better . Singstar Rocks does not do this.The big thing is with the PS2 having two standard USB ports , why they would utilize the mini to USB adapter . This renders the mics useless to the KR games . If they 're worried about being able to use an EyeToy simultaneously to two mics , maybe they should have included a USB mini hub instead . It infuriates me that with all the decent USB mics on the market that Sony again would go proprietary ( of sorts ) .Another complaint is the lack of adjustments . In song , KR ( dating back to the original ) allows you to adjust the vocals , mic and music . Singstar Rocks has only a master volume that does n't see to do much.It 's also unfortunate that Sony stuck with only Sony artists , as they are missing out on a ton of others . The song selection is very random due to this and a couple are very strange selections to have on a sing along disc . There are multiple songs on here that do not make a lot of sense . Of all the Rolling Stones catalog , why would Forty Licks ' `` Paint it Black '' be the one to appear . Lame ! In a vacuum , the game is fun , but its song selection , lack of options and its proprietary options all make it fall extremely short to any of the other Karaoke Revolution . Do n't waste your time with this one . Get *any* of the KR series over this one .	-1
I got this game after purchasing a PS3 , thinking that even if this game was n't all that great , I could use the two microphones ( which came with a USB adaptor ) for Karaoke Revolution games . I was wrong . Because the microphones are not actual USB mics and have to plug into a USB adaptor , Karaoke Revolution games do not detect these `` SingStar '' mics.Secondly , SingStar does not give you the option to remove the lead vocals from the songs . This defeats the whole purpose of Karaoke . Even on Karaoke mode , the lead vocals are still there.Lastly , The game has a very small selection of songs , and there are a handful of tracks that are `` medleys '' , which are basically a medley from choruses of the same songs that are already on this game.Conclusion . This is NOT a Karaoke game , as it does not give you the option to strip the lead vocals , and the microphones included with the game are not compatible with any other games for the PS2 or PS3 . If I was given the option , I would give this game ZERO stars .	-1
At first this game is jawdropping . Beautiful graphics , a fast engine , original ideas and a unique premise . After playing through a few games , however , one quickly comes to realize that every session is essentially the same . There is little variation from mission to mission in the actual gameplay and it rapidly becomes a very repetitive experience .	-1
I really , truly , do not understand how Settlers has managed to get to a fourth release . I would have thought this game would have died out after the first . Everything about the game is annoying and confusing . You need to produce all sorts of resources from different spots , and it 's not clear when you need to produce something you 're not . This can lead to a lot of head-scratching while you try to figure out why exactly your miners are n't mining . You really do n't have that much control of the individual units the way you do in almost every good strategy game . The combat is dull and not particularly tactical , and the graphics are pretty dated . Most of all , this game just is n't fun . It feels more like a tutorial in a free market economy than a game ! Pick up Civ 3 or Age of Empires 2 if you want an historical strategy game .	-1
It 's a shame . Looks like this could be a good game but after installing the whole game , it just would not run on my computer . After reading the reviews , I 'm leary about installing patches - so I just uninstalled . BioWare should never have released a game that works only on certain computers ?	-1
The game crashed my hard drive and forced me to BUY a new one.All of that happened after I unsuccessfully tried to install and run the game . I have a computer and engineering background , so this senario is not typical for me ! I know what I 'm doing and if it takes too long or if it crashes , most likely , it 's not my fault ! The whole installation process was lagged ( it would take several seconds for every move you 'd make to respond ) ... in the middle of the installation I was already frustrated but decided to finish it all the way , and then restart my system and see if it made any difference.Well , it didn't.I tried any display settings I could think of.I updated ( or checked for updates ) on all my drivers.I double checked anything I could possibly think of ... and at the end , the game ran slower than a snail ... and to add insult to the injury , the next thing I knew , the infamous blue-screen was there ! ! ! Last time I had a `` blue microsoft screen '' I was running windows NT , not XP ! ! Need I say that I was never able to recover my computer , or the data on my harddrive ? I had to buy a new hard drive as the old one had been damaged beyond repair and ended up losing lots of data.You 've been warned ! Buy and install at your own risk .	-1
This game is an insult to the world of Dungeon and dragonsCome on even Pool of Radiance is better than this.What the heck is this going back to the old format of dnd games Hello there , gamer want perspective like diablo2 Baldur 's gatewhere you can see your charcter see in slash , cast a spell not a permenant camera following you has if you were in a maze.Extremely complicated for nothing thank good i have a geoforce2 asus 7700 powered by nvidia or else is it back to store for a refund or an exchange.I got nothing else to say that was n't said from the other reviewers ... Get Warcraft3 and Diablo2 or even Pool of Radiance , Icewindale ... GhostRider666 the spirit of vengeance	-1
Neverwinter Nights is really not a computer game in the traditional sense . It 's more of an electronic version of the pen and paper role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons . If you are an avid D & D ; player who ca n't get your group together at your own house , you now have the internet to do it . While this is fine for pen and paper D & D ; groupies , the rest of us are left out in the cold.Basically , Neverwinter Nights is set up in the hopes that a community will help it grow . The game comes with a sample campaign to play but it also comes with a complete editor that lets anyone design their own D & D ; adventures . Either with the official campaign included in box or some of the community made mods ( there are already 500+ available online ) , you can play Neverwinter Nights by yourself or online with a group of players . To further enhance the pen and paper D & D ; experience , there is even a dungeon master client in the game . If you do n't know what a dungeon master is I can already tell you you 're purchasing the wrong game . Basically , a DM watches over the mod and controls the adventure to hopefully provide a better game for the players . Sort of like an invisible referee.This all sounds great when reading it on the back of the box but I 'm not sure it really works . For one thing , while the editor has a lot of capabilities , every map has that same square-look to it to fit in the D & D ; grid system . Nothing looks natural and after playing a few mods you 've seen everything the game has to offer and it all starts to repeat itself . Also , for a game that relies on the community to invent new adventures , the editor is more difficult than it should be . If you do n't know programming basics , you 're going to have a difficult time with the editor as every simple action has to be scripted which is basically simple C+ programming . To accomodate this new system and catch up with its competitors , Neverwinter Nights also has a new 3-D system that reminds me of hack and slash games like Diablo more than the company 's previous classic release Baldur 's Gate I and II . In fact , the official campaign included in the game is NOTHING compared to the Baldur 's Gate games and I would recommend that you not buy this game if the official campaign is the only thing you will play . The included campaign is boring , linear and not that creative , it 's more of a sample for the editor rather than an epic adventure.If you plan on only playing online , be careful if you only have a 56K modem . You 'll never be able to host more than 3 players on your computer without lag . Also , you 'll have a difficult time joining the large servers with 20+ players if your connection is slow . Neverwinter Nights comes with an ingame browser that divides online games by category . You can join the action channel , the roleplaying channel , etc . Most of these games are called persistent worlds and are basically smaller versions of Everquest . While they can be for awhile because of their small size and limited equipment , quests , etc. , they never provide much fun . The best way to play the game is to get together with a group of friends and meet on a weekly basis just like you would the pen and paper D & D . ; While you can find people to play with through online fan sites , you 'll have a much better time with this game if you already know people that own it and are willing to play the same mod with you at scheduled times.After trying this game for a month , frankly , I feel cheated . I bought the game because it promised gamers that even if they did n't want to play online or use the editor they could play the official campaign included in the game by themselves and have just as much fun as they did with the company 's other epic releases Baldur 's Gate I and II . That 's a misleading claim because the new mechanics of Neverwinter Nights and the boring campaign included are pitiful attempts to live up to the company 's previous PC D & D ; games . This game is really only for people that want to enjoy an electronic pen and paper version of D & D ; , the rest of us should move on to Icewind Dale II or Morrowind or hope that another company manages to design a great singleplayer RPG as fantastic as the Baldur 's Gate series .	-1
I do n't see how anyone could possibly like this game . I could n't get into it after several tries . The game play is the worst thing about it , the perspective is awful , movement sucks , one fight can last a very long time , even it 's foundation is bad and even that is being generous . I see that many people like it , but the old infinity engine games are so much better in so many different ways . I do n't even like them , but they hands down beat this game . It 's a big step in a very bad direction for the series . It might have a lot of depth for all I know , but it 's so terrible that I could n't find out . Playing it was like being repeatedly stabbed with pins , it drags on and on . It 's incredible how narrow , boring , slow , drab , and awful it is . The best things about it even make it worse . After playing Baldur 's Gate 1 & 2 , Icewind Dale 1 & 2 , Dragonshard , and Demon Stone this is by very very far the worst of the bunch . I wish there was some redeeming quality to mention here . Usually I try to throw in some good point no matter how bad something is , but I really ca n't come up with anything at all . I 've played video games my whole life and I would rather play pong than this waste of space .	-1
This game was not as good as everyone made it out to be . After playing this one I did not get any others of the series .	-1
I hate writing negative reviews . I like writing positive reviews about things that have entertained or educated me , but sometimes something gets me frustrated enough that I feel obligated to inform others.While I normally start with complaints , I feel it necessary to start with the good things about Arcanum . Arcanum has the potential to be one of the coolest games ever made . It has an original story , an immersive world with colorful characters , and a variety of playing styles to suit anyones prefernces.Unfortunately , all of these positive things are shrouded in one of the buggiest pieces of code that has ever come across my PC . Characters and Items either fail to appear , or disapppear for no apparent reason making the main plot impossible to further . It 's one thing to get stuck in a little subplot , but it 's another thing to get stuck in the middle of the story simply because of technical errors.I spent hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong at times , only to visit the game forum at the official site and find message after message complaining about & quot ; bug this & quot ; and & quot ; fix that & quot ; . The current patch has done nothing to help me . I think my bugs maybe a little worse than others , but almost everyone has experienced at least minor bugs and glitches.If this were some impulse buy I would have just given up and moved on to something else , but Arcanum , when working properly , is a really great game . That 's what makes it SO frustrating , the fact that hidden under all that bad programming a great concept is dying to come out . I expect more from the guys that created the Fallout series which are some of the most entertaining games ever made . The guys over at Troika should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this game as a finished product.Hopefully you wo n't experience as many showstopping bugs as I did , but be warned , they are out there . If you do n't believe me , just visit the official site boards and look for yourself . Hopefully , Troika will make this game playable , and if they do I will gladly come back here and edit my review .	-1
It has that bulder 's gate blahh feel to it . Very slow moving . I have an extremely high-end system and it moves very slowly , just as bulder 's gate does . What is the fascination with that style of game ? ? ? Sure it uses ad & d rules but it does it so gruelingly slowly ! ... Anyway , I played Arcanum for a day and the novelty of the ability to fire a gun in an RPG wore off due to the terrible interface . Top that off with the ... quality of the Sierra name ( it 's become apparent they rush developers into releasing buggy low-quality software with cool packaging - cheers to their marketing company ! ) and you 're looking at one crummy game . Do n't waste your time or money on this one .	-1
Stuttering graphics , severe slowing during actions , cheesy graphics you 'd expect from about 5 or 6 years ago ... ... [ PRICE ] Not only that , multiplayer is practically nonexistant , the patches are extremely unreliable , game freezes AFTER the patches ... ... ... ... Take my advice ... ... ... stay away from this and all other Sierra Products . Keep in mind , this is the same company that came out with the little gem Rage of Mages ... ... ... ... .	-1
Koudelka was a game that I really wanted to love . I picked it up during my old game store raids as a kid , during the golden era of RPGs ( 1994-2001 ) .Koudelka sat shining on a shelf at my locally-owned video game store . As a unique blend of role playing elements set to a gothic timeline , I was immediately hooked . When I got home and popped the disc in , I was so ready to dive into this unique world.Unfortunately , I never truly had the chance . The graphics were only decent for the time , with even lesser-known titles showing much more polish . The music was very disappointing , especially given Hiroki Kikuta 's wonderful tunes in the Mana series . What really ruined the experience for me was the battle system . It was jagged , slow , and quite bland - the polar opposite of Sacnoth Games ' intentions.As a person who bought and beat almost all of the role-playing games of the PSX era , this one stands out as a true let-down . Out of my 21 RPGs for the original Playstation , this is the only one I did not beat . It stands among my otherwise proud collection , a sad sign of good intentions scarred by poor execution .	-1
Boring and cut-scene crazy . Not much different than the original command n conquer . Come 'on , let 's get original you guys !	-1
After the greatly successful N64 game Mario Golf , Camalot Software decided to cook up a new sports title for the year . I had extremely high hopes for Mario Tennis , but in the end it was very disapointing . It 's too bad really , because it had all the potential to be an amazing game , but fell flat on its face . It took me a little over five hours to complete in its entirety , so that will give you a clue to just how bad this game is .	-1
I like Poke'mon , but do not buy this game ! The peoffesor runs the whole thing , Pikachu never listens , there is a time limit ( ... ) . Be smart , do n't buy it !	-1
So , to most of the GR readers , I 'm warning you to stay away . It 's the video game equivalent of going to the library and reading a Golden Book instead of Tolstoy . But if you have a really young sibling or even a child of your own who definitely likes Pikachu and can bear all his long term annoyances , there might be a possible Christmas present there .	-1
Alright , I may not be the biggest Pokemon fan there is , but I know a flop when I see one . I do n't know about you , but I 'm sick of seeing those little Japanese toys that you have to feed and take care of , and if you leave it for a second it dies . I suggest pulling out one of those old Tamagotchi 's , it will save you some cash.Overall , I give Hey You ! Pikachu 2 stars . The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because even though this game is pointless , that Pikachu sure is cute ! I would only recommend it to people who 's kids are die-hard Pokemon fans .	-1
This is just about opinions , and this is my opinion : this game was just not fun . Before you rate this review just read it because I got quite a few reasons while i do n't like it . I really do n't like the game because there is a certain amount of time you have to do for things , and I can never seem to find the person I need to find , and the game is just too hard to play . For the age I was at the time I got this ( 9 ) this game I found slow , and unfun . Then again , I do n't really like too many adventure games . Here is my stack , I 'm sure all of you guys will disagree , because as it seems , most people like this game.Graphics : 5/5 . For an N64 game , these were very well done , I believe they needed the advanced graphics thing you had to put into the system.Sound : 5/5 . The sound is great . The sounds in towns , the voices , the cutscenes , everything about the sound is great.Control : 4/5 . There are some times when controls can get confused , and you can get a little angry at the game because you pressed the wrong button , but they are overall easy to get used to.Fun : 2/5 . Even though I rated everything else high , I really dislike this game . It is just not my type of game , and like I said before , it 's slow , boring , and too hard . ( It was when i was 9 , at least . I have n't played it too recently . ) Even though this game is rated E for everyone , be warned : this game is not very easy , OR fun . But I 'm sure there are those people out there that enjoy these games . I would still reccomend the older Zelda games , the SNES ones .	-1
Let me ask you a question . When playing A Link to the Past and Ocarina of Time , do you think Kakariko Village is the most important part of the game ? Do you think meeting everyone in town , getting to know their personalities , and figuring out their dilemmas is the most exciting part of the quest ? Then Majora 's Mask is for you . Me ? I think meeting people in Zelda games should only be one of *several* fun things a player can do . There 's also exploring rich and colorful overworlds , fighting enemies and bosses with specific weapons and strategies , collecting exciting items that take advantage of the heroic Zelda theme , and exploring dangerous and challenging dungeons filled with traps and aggressive enemies around every corner . When you add up all these crucial features that I 've grown to associate with the Zelda series , it officially makes a Zelda adventure feel like a complete package . So what happens when you take away most of these trademark features of Zelda ? You 're left with an incomplete , unsatisfying boring game . Proof that storytelling and character development can only provide entertainment for so long . This is why Majora 's Mask is n't very good.Majora 's Mask does tell a remarkable story and has pretty decent characters . There 's no Ganon as the bad guy but I do n't really mind . He 's been used too many times anyway . Many of the characters from Ocarina of Time even return for another appearance , such as the music box guy , the horse owner and the Goron 's . Their specific theme songs from Ocarina of Time can be heard as well . The story is that Link takes a walk into the woods after the events of Ocarina of Time , and a mischievous imp named Skull Kid supporting two naive fairies turns evil upon wearing a mask . This imp is especially a big jerk- not only does he want Link to die , he wants him to suffer as well . Why ? Because he 's wearing the Majora 's Mask , a mask with mysterious powers . This Skull Kid guy is now completely out of control and Link is apparently the only one who can stop him . Sound appealing to you ? It is . Too bad the gameplay is so one-dimensional with all the errand running concerning the townspeople . Oh but there 's another aspect to the story- the moon above is angry and if Link is n't able to finish the quest in under 72 hours and stop Skull Kid 's madness , the moon will crash into the planet and everyone will die . An enticing and noticeably darker theme for a Zelda game . The moon totally reminds me of the angry sun from Super Mario Bros. 3 . Just *look* at his face , haha.Instead of Kakariko Village you have Clock Town . No it 's not a town dominated by clocks ; it 's a perfectly normal looking town with buildings and ordinary people running around , many of which are n't the least bit concerned that the world is coming to an end which is quite a peculiar reaction if I do say so . Throughout this town you perform tedious tasks such as finding children in a hide and seek game , and a needlessly generic rupee collecting mission that involves floating around on pink Deku flowers and landing safely on generic platforms . Clock Town itself is divided into four basic areas . North , South , West and East . You 'll be *constantly* running back and forth between these four areas over and over again figuring out the mediocre tasks relating to the townspeople . The theme song that you hear in Clock Town is cute enough to make you puke ! Reminds me of the Muppet Babies , seriously.Unfortunately the repulsive baby-like and overdone ocarina-playing segments are back one again where you have to play songs by way of pressing a sequence of buttons . This is comparable to a 3-year old kid pressing buttons on a toy and believing he 's making great music . I HATE this aspect of the 3D Zelda series so much . You 'll be playing the Song of Time hundreds of times since the idea is that you have to go back to a previous time whenever the moon above gets a little too close for comfort and you 're in danger of running out of time . The good news is that going back to a previous time means you can re-collect rupees and other things ( where you can repeatedly deposit rupees by way of a banker in West Clock Town , allowing you to run around collecting a bunch of rupees and simply return to this same spot over and over as a way to keep them stored ) . The bad news ? Going back in time is often inconvenient since you JUST spent several minutes trying to advance the plot ( and probably desperately hoping the game offers something more than going around talking to people ) so this whole `` going back in time '' portion of the gameplay gets pretty annoying after a while . A Link to the Past allows Link to transport to a dark `` mirror '' world and Ocarina of Time uses time travel- these concepts are both a lot better than repeatedly going over the same areas and rooms and opening the same chests that only serve as a pitiful attempt to drag out the length of Majora 's Mask.Eventually you leave Clock Town ( thank GOD ) and venture out to a smaller , barren and plain-looking overworld with empty fields , scarce and badly animated enemies , and just a totally uninteresting and failed attempt at exploration . The game has an enormous amount of heart container pieces . WAY too many in fact . You get to wear a variety of masks , some of them necessary to make progress , other masks for entertainment value . Either way , putting on a variety of masks so you can complete tasks and errands hardly satisfies that urge to finish the game , and due to the plethora of problems I 've already mentioned , this is n't enough to make me feel like I 'm taking on a legitimate Zelda adventure . I guess that 's the point since technically Majora 's Mask is a subplot anyway.Soon you arrive to a swamp where a dumb but admittedly funny story pertaining to a tied up monkey accused of kidnapping a princess takes place . The story is the *only* good portion of this swamp/Deku Palace I 'm afraid . From here you have a boring stealth mission avoiding being caught , boring lily pad jumps , platform gliding by way of a Deku Flower item which is really childish , and overall tacky combat so the storyline can take center stage . My God is it ever torturous killing enemies with bubbles ( yes that 's right , BUBBLES ! ) in this one underground portion . You have to eliminate 30 enemies and collect the prize they leave behind- gold skulltula tokens for the Mask of Truth ( or a Giant Wallet later on ) .Of course the second biggest problem with the game ( besides focusing on story and characters and nothing else ) is that the dungeons are limited to only four , and half of them are n't what I 'd call particularly long or memorable either . The Woodfall Temple is surprisingly short and uninspiring . It 's all about torch-lighting puzzles , collecting stray fairies which is a mandatory mini quest I guess you can say probably used as a means to make the dungeons feel longer then they really are , running across narrow wooden platforms , floating around on your pink Deku flower ( and by the way , Link looks horrific wearing the Deku mask ) and an uncreative sword-swinging boss fight at the end . This place falls short of being interesting . Snowhead Temple is one of the better dungeons . You have to roll , punch or pound your way through the snow and ice wearing the Goron Mask which alters Link 's moves completely . You have to collect more stray fairies and shoot patches of ice with fire arrows . The fast-paced boss fight is pretty fun at least , but the Wizzrobe mini battles are sort of annoying . He teleports all over the room and you have , I 'm afraid , *two* battles with him.Great Bay Temple focuses around lighting torches , pulling switches/platform jumps , swimming around ( or having the current push Link ) and figuring out which room you 're supposed to go through all the while being underwater . This is actually the best temple in the game . It 's challenging in a way that makes you think without being annoying which instantly makes it leagues better than Ocarina of Time 's horrendous water dungeon which was nothing more than a snoozefest . Graphically it looks really good too . The mini boss is the same as the boss from the water dungeon in Link to the Past but in a 3D world of course . The fish boss fight is pretty difficult but fast and fun too . Excellent dungeon overall . Now the Stone Tower Temple is a major disappointment in comparison . It 's all about statue and switch puzzles , walking statue enemies , underwater swimming with a commendable amount of enemies and threats ( in the water at least , nowhere else ) and having to reflect light to open doors . The boss made of bats is original and awesome in appearance . The main boss fight is the same exact thing as Lanmolas , the sand worms/snakes from the desert palace in Link to the Past . This is pretty easy for a boss fight too . Overall however , Stone Tower is incredibly bland and a chore to go through.The final showdown with the gigantic Majora 's Mask is cool and ominous in appearance , but lousy in strategy and execution . You basically spend your entire time dodging whips slapping around the room as well as fire attacks , and basically the object is to use arrows and swords to bring him down . Whichever incarnation you 're facing , a well-equipped Link assures this battle simply is n't challenging enough . The ending is meaningless too . I ca n't remember ever finishing a game and feeling like I just wasted my time . The fairies are boring and do n't really seem interested or grateful for anything you 've done . Neither does Skull Kid or anybody else . This just goes to show how unmemorable Majora 's Mask is overall . Interesting note- the Astral Observatory opens with a couple notes that totally sounds like the intro to Billy Joel 's `` Captain Jack '' classic , a song some of you may know . Some of the mini games are really fun I admit . The target/bow and arrow games are fun , especially the one where you actually shoot enemies . I really hate the fact Big Skulltula returns , perhaps the most overrated enemy in the entire Zelda series.I 'm not sure if this should be named the worst Zelda game of all-time . Zelda II : The Adventure of Link for the NES may in fact be worse due to an awkwardly implemented way of battling enemies in side-scroller fashion with bad play control and a REALLY bland overworld . That game is probably worse than Majora 's Mask but only by a tiny notch . Other things that annoy me is the password-demanding kid in Clock Town , the lovey dovey man and woman in the mini game room , and *especially* the marching rooster collecting game that obviously seems designed for little babies as evident by the nursery rhyme music that plays while performing this horrendous game . Watching Link march around to this music is just sad on so many levels . The twin dancers in Clock Town perfecting their moves to Egyptian music resulting in Link performing some rather hilarious and bizarre moves of his own is a nice moment of comedy . I 'm not too crazy about the platform flowers that rise after you water them . A nifty way to get around perhaps , but rather clumsy in design overall . Pick up the other 3D Zelda 's instead of Majora 's Mask and you probably will be happy you did .	-1
Im a huge Zelda fan but this game was a complete dissapointment . first lets talk about the game play . you are sent on a 3 day trip to find a mask taken by a skull kid and you only get a limit of time which is like 1 hour whats up with that I mean just let use play with out worrieing about a time limit . Also by saving you have to find an owl and its a complicated saves process and why cant it be like Orcarina of time when you can save when you want . You cant even be adult Link . When you beat the game you get to use the Majoras mask but theres no point your done with the game . So there has to be one good thing about this game and it fits in a toaster . So go get Orcorina of time and not this	-1
I simply did not enjoy this game at all ! As Ocarina of Time was a great game : ) , this game was not a great sequel at all like everybody says it is : ( . I first played this game on Zelda : Collector 's Edition after playing Ocarina and I was immediately disappointed for several reasons:1 . The style of gameplay is different.2 . It 's WAY too challenging , even though I like a challenge ! 3 . Figuring out what you do first takes ages and ages.4 . Dungeons are nearly impossible to beat , even with strategy.5 . Not many places to save ( without going back in time ) .6 . Figuring out , even getting to the next dungeon is a pain in the neck ! 7 . MAIN POINT : Only having three days to complete each dungeon is freaken annoying ! Overall , this game sucks ! Do n't waste money on this game , regardless . Stick with Ocarina of Time or Wind Waker . ALL ZELDA FANS , PLEASE HEAD THIS WARNING !	-1
the reason i do n't like majora 's mask is because it has a ridiculous story line . first of all you have to do all this junk to get certain things . plus you have to stop the moon from smashing into the earth that is the stupidest thing i have ever heard.this game is not loyal to all the previous zelda games nor does it have any returning characters such as princess zelda . ocarina of time is without a doubt better than majora 's mask .	-1
i loved zelda : ocarina of time so i was ecstatic when this came out . the problem for me is i found this game to be more effort than fun . you battle time on top of the many tasks that lay before you . the game was ok at first but eventually i got frustrated because there was simply too much going on and it was too much effort and really not much fun . being a deku was cool and all but the novelty wore off and i eventually sold this game without completion . i never left deku stage . too much effort and no fun at all .	-1
I would have to say that this game was really just thrown together , probably to get more funds for future projects . It is unlike any other game you have played , which is not always a good thing , because the unique part about this game is you have 72 hours ! There is no catch , you have 72 hours , however you do have the song of time to take you back to the starting time . Then , if you do that , you must do everything all over again ! It is a very tedious game ! You must do the same tasks over and over again ! Also , the game was so easy that I was able of beating it in two days upon first playing it ! If you are looking for a long challenge , get the other Zelda ! This game also requires the N64 Expansion pack , so make sure you have it !	-1
This game I do n't think lived up to the Legend Of Zelda standard . The gameplay was just as good , maybe even better than Ocarina Of Time but the plot was just too horrible ! I can understand a mask that makes a guy evil and is now bent on causing chaos throughout the land , but did they really need to make the moon fall ? I think they should have had more like he was making new masks and brainwashing people with his powers , then I would actually try finishing the game . And this game is way too short . They should have made it at least 3/4 as long as Final Fantasy X . But they did n't so instead they make a bunch of cheesy side-quests to get everything you need . I did like the masks idea though . That and those funny little monkeys in Woodfall . I could laugh at them for hours . But anyway , I 've had it almost three years now and I 'm not even to the final temple yet . That 's just about how boring it is . Now I shall give it a final rating.Entertainment 4.0Plot 2.5Difficulty 6.0Gameplay 8.5Sountrack 5.5Characters 7.0Replay Value 2.5Overal Rating 5.0So that 's just my opinion . And if you do n't agree , fine . And if you want to play a good Zelda game , play Ocarina Of Time . And if you 've already beaten Ocarina Of Time , then I guess you just out of luck.BOTTOM LINE : Bad plot , bad game .	-1
This game right here is Zeldas downfall . After playing all other Zelda games and just completing Ocarina of Time ( which IS a very good game ) I heard about a new one coming out . I was very excited and couldent wait . Once it did come out I rushed to the store bought it , rushed back , tore it out , put it in the N64 , turned it on and was expeting to be transfixed in a game that comes from the best series for a few hours ( atleast ) . What did happen was once I started playing it my spirit started dropping lower and lower . I saw just how different this was then Ocarina of Time , or any other Zelda game . I was very annoyed by the time limit and how you had to play games to keep going , and before I bought this game I was really happy about the thought of transforming into different creatures but when it did happen I was not stunned . About an hour or two into this game I just gave up . About every other day I played it but was still not happy . Every time I started to play I got very unhappy just thinking about what was going to happen rather then the good , happy , determined feeling I got while playing Ocarina of Time or all the other Zelda games . So after a week I sold it . There went six months of thoughts and saving up for what should of been the best game yet . So as I said before this game is the downfall of the Zelda series and shows us a glimps of what Zelda will be like from now on . I mean come on what next a Zelda with Cel shading ? ( In case you didnt understand that was a joke about the new Zelda game coming out for Gamecube that is , yes in cell shading	-1
Most people imagined that after Ocarina of Time , Majora 's Mask would be all that and a bag of chips . Or a bag of bombs , take your pick . It 's nowhere near the level of Ocarina of Time and was much shorter . Ocarina of Time had 11 dungeaons-that 's right , if you count the Bottom of the Well , Ice Cavern , and Ganon 's Castle it 's 11- compared to Majora 's Mask 's 4 dungeons . I 'll say 5 since all the other sub-dungeons could combine as one . The only reason I did n't give this game 1 star was because it had great graphics . Absolutely spectacular images . If only the pudding thick storyline were as good as the graphics . I beat this game in under 14 hours of gameplay . Definitely not worth 60 bucks . Then there are the & quot ; sidequests & quot ; that try to give you something to do when your stuck and wan na let off some steam . Similar to the gold Skulltullas in Ocarina , you must collect all 24 masks to see the & quot ; perfect ending & quot ; and get the secret ultra mighty mega supernova Fierce Diety 's Mask- which can only be used against bosses ... joy . The new feel wears out fast since it feels like play a watered down version of Ocarina of Time . Save your money and get a Gamecube or feel depressed with a hole in your heart and a hole in your wallet .	-1
I hereby pronounce the Zelda series dead . Ocarina of Time had bestowed upon me a premonition that perhaps Zelda 's death as a series would soon come to pass in the near future , and Majora 's Mask confirmed my sinking feeling in such an exact and nauseating manor as only a truly pathetic game can.First of all , Zelda does n't belong in 3D . It robs the player of the ability to be aware of everything in the room , an ability that is VITAL to the Zelda motif . I 've said this about Ocarina of Time , and I say it now about Majora 's Mask.Not only that , but you 'll spend less than half the time with any actual gameplay ( dungeons and the like ) . About half of this game consists of wandering around Clock Town solving people 's problems for them like some kind of deranged therapist . While I 'll admit that the roots of this element are plainly visible in the most brilliant installment in the Zelda series ( A Link to the Past , naturally ! ) , it has now been carried WAY too far.The third and final majorly boneheaded move in Majora 's Mask is the revival of an ancient gaming abstraction that should have been left dead and buried : the time limit . Nothing good can come of such a thing . Any game with a time limit is not a leisurely activity as a video game should be , but a frantic scramble . BEING FRANTIC IS NOT FUN , people.That 's the last of my major gripes , but the problems do n't end there . For example , both Ocarina of Time and Majora 's Mask are quite depraved ; did you know that ? WHAT IS THIS STUPID SPIDER OBSESSION ? Guess what Nintendo , it 's DISGUSTING ! I hated the Deku Tree , and now I hate that god-awful thing in the swamp . Being obsessed with spider webs is just plain CREEPY . ( I do n't even want to KNOW what kinds of `` activities '' they were performing as they envisioned fantasies of those spiders in their heads ! )	-1
When evaluating video games , I consider `` The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time '' to be the greatest adventure game I have ever played . As such , I was absolutely ecstatic when its sequel came out and I could once again resume Link 's quest . Unfortunately , that excitement lasted for roughly 10-15 minutes ... or until the gameplay actually started.I realize that there is a large contingent of people who consider this game to be one of the best ever produced , but from the perspective of a casual gamer , it is largely a disappointment for the following reasons : -The time element . One of the great things about `` Ocarina '' is that the gameplay was almost completely left up to the discretion of the player . One could go from temple to temple in short order , or you could wander around exploring a little bit , trying out some mini-games with no fears of `` falling behind '' . With the time aspect of `` Majora 's Mask '' , however , you always feel pressured to complete certain tasks by a certain time . That sprawling , epic feel of `` Ocarina '' is completely gone.-Saving . As players of the old NES system learned decades ago , there is nothing more frustrating than not being able to accurately save your progress within the gaming experience . Some of us are not hardcore gamers , and often life intercedes with an ability to find an owl statue or play an Ocarina song . This is a MAJOR flaw in this game that renders it painfully frustrating at many occasions . If a game is to appeal `` to the masses '' , it must have a straightforward saving mechanism.-Too many sidequests . While `` Ocarina '' struck the perfect balance between `` major quests '' and `` side quests '' , `` Majora '' is positively riddled with mini-games , to the point of absolute overload . Again , whereas `` Ocarina '' was straightforward with room for adventuring , in `` Majora '' there are so many things going on that it produces a sensation of fear and overwhelming.Overall , I feel as if `` Majora 's Mask '' was made for the hardcore gamers instead of the casual fans of the series . Whether that was a `` good '' or `` bad '' choice is up for debate , of course , but in my experience it completely turned me off from the whole experience . I 've tried to `` get back into '' this game on multiple occasions , but every time it just leaves me frustrated .	-1
Rent the game before you buy it ! I know most people find the game funny and fun , but in truth , it is actually very disturbing . To me , at least . And it is so sad to see a funny game have a sad ending .	-1
My problem with Conker does n't have as much to do with the idea so much as it does the follow-through . In all honesty , I was thrilled to hear the company had recognized their own flaws and were attempting to reconcile for them by releasing a shockingly robust title that seemed to spit in the face of everything they 'd done since the debates caused by the home release of the original Mortal Kombat . However , I left my initial playing with the sense that the while idea itself was exactly what the company needed , the execution was more than a tad lacking.The story plays out like a theatrical feature , which is appropriate considering the number of situations the game eventually borrows from popular films . Glass of milk ( or is it a white russian ? ) in hand and a scowl plastered upon his face , Conker is immediately reminiscent of the kind of anti-hero popularized by Bruce Willis in Die Hard or Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction . Surrounded by his supposed friends and acquaintances , this introductory scene was a great way to set the tone of the story and introduce a hardened , slightly older version of the title 's namesake . The moment the king 's flashback begins is when the player begins to take control of the action.There 's a lot of Hollywood inspiration in Conker 's tale . From the little nuances and cliches such as the opening scene , to borrowed scenes or tips of the hat to films like the location of the King 's throne at the end of the game , to straightforward rip-offs of memorable scenes or films like the unquestionably Matrix bank heist , this cartridge is chock full of film-lore . And , to its credit , the vast majority of the game 's quirks , nods and thefts are handled very well , with just enough originality and additional humor thrown in to make it work within the broad confines of its storyline.For the most part , the story is successful . Its film parodies are spot on , while its original threads tend to lag behind a bit and force a joke just for the sake of it . It feels like the game was rushed , and rather than waiting for the inspiration to create something undeniably funny , the writers instead went with whatever they came up with the fastest . In addition , there 's little if any direction as to what you should be doing at any point in the story . Bad Fur Day is a big fan of putting you in the middle of an immense area with no visual clues as to where you should go from there , then erecting giant invisible walls out of thin air and hoping that their placement will corral you into the exact area in which you should be . Successful or not , this method is employed over and over and over again , from the game 's start until its finish.While the storyline is competent for the most part , the actual control and gameplay itself is nearly unforgivable . Physically controlling Conker is a complete nightmare . Even the use of the N64 's well-designed analog joystick ca n't save this horribly imprecise setup , as the squirrel will occasionally veer left or right without explanation or mosey over the edge of a cliff moments after you 've told him to stop moving entirely . Conker does have a sort of double-jump feature , in that through the use of his tail he can hover in the air for a couple additional seconds . He can also perform a high jump and a long jump , by crouching or running for a few second before leaping , accordingly . Unfortunately , these high jump and long jump options only seem to work when they feel like it . I 've been running for upwards of a full minute , jumped , and watched Conker perform a weak little sissy jump and fall to his doom . This game really feels like something that was n't fully tested before its release , the controls reek of incompletion.Add onto that one of the most horrific cameras in the history of 3-D rendering , and you 've already got a pissed off gamer . Seriously , you 're given supposed control of these angles through the use of the C buttons ( similar to the way the camera is maneuvered in The Legend of Zelda : The Ocarina of Time ) , but as soon as you find a vantage point you 're comfortable with and release the C button , it just goes off on its own and returns to a completely unhelpful , useless view . This camera can not pass through walls , so if your back is against one and you 're trying to prepare for a complicated , lengthy , precise leap , you 've got to do it blind . Better still , once you 've made up your mind and attempted said jump , the camera will awkwardly spin as soon as it 's got room to get behind you , effectively reversing your controls in mid-air and introducing a loss of direction to your life.The audio is one of the few undeniable triumphs of this one . The voice acting is tremendous , Conker 's voice suits him perfectly and the actors themselves seem to be having a lot of fun with the material . The music is the usual fare for Rare platformers , light and bouncy , and serves as a constant joke considering the circumstances surrounding it . Little tidbits like the main character mumbling to himself and retching when he 's drunk , or fighting back bile while rolling an enormous ball of poo really make a difference in the experience , and are things I wish more games took the time to incorporate.When push comes to shove , there 's really only one thing you can create with the ingredients provided by Conker 's Bad Fur Day , and that 's disappointment . There 's no question in my mind this game needed another couple months of production before it was ready to ship , and looking back it should be regarded as the poster boy for the N64 's lifespan . This game was n't created to entertain and enamor so much as it was to annoy , frustrate and defeat .	-1
If you want to see cute cartoon animals acting just like Beavis & ButtHead , then look no further than this disaster of a game.Once a lovable squirrel that fought acorns , poor Conker has been turned into a furry Beavis ( or furry ButtHead ) and generally staggers through the game , accomplishing absolutely NOTHING.And that 's just how you feel when you try to play this piece of garbage-you 'll constantly feel that you 're not getting anywhere and that you 're not accomplishing a single thing.In the game , all you do is get drunk , swear , stagger around , puke and have a hangover-all through the entire game.You 'll start to feel like you 're in the animal version of Beavis & ButtHead ( remember how much Beavis & ButtHead love to swear , do drugs and get drunk ? ) , and you 'll start to wonder where the fun and enjoyment is.Unlike `` Conker 's Pocket Tales '' , there are no goals to accomplish , there is no plot , and there is absolutely NOTHING to do except swear , get drunk , puke and have a hangover.Despite how much people try to get you to believe that `` Conker 's Bad Fur Day '' is the greatest game around , you 'll learn the truth about this game : That it 's just a big promotion for alcohol.Do yourselvwes a favor and get `` Conker 's Pocket Tales '' instead.If you want a REAL M-rated game , then get Grand Theft Auto .	-1
This is a horrible game ! It is really , really gory and nasty . The multiplayer mode is hard , and Rare really made a big mistake ! If I could choose to buy either Yoshi 's Story or BFD , I would choose YS , and I 'm 19 ! Oh , Conker , what have they done to you !	-1
Conker 's Bad Fur Day may look like some cute Banjo Kazooie game , but guess what ? It is far more complex than Banjo Kazooie . This little twerp pees on his enemies , swears , gets drunk , posses as an army guy , and does other stupid things . This is not a game for children to be playing . He even has sex with girls in some movies . Parents , do n't even consider buying this for your five year old . Infact , not even when they 're seventeen .	-1
This game a foul - the long cut scenes are full of disgusting humor . Those were the best bits . The actual game iteself seemed like cruel and unusual punishment . The 'puzzles ' would n't stump a four year old and the game play is tedious and repetitive . If I had n't borrowed the game from a friend I would have put it down the garbage disposal by now.The game suffers from many of the problems that Nintendo games have . You have long and tedious jumping sequences in which the character will often fail to jump for no apparent reason causing you to have to repeat the sequence from the start over and over ad nauseam . The direction the character moves depends on the camera angle and , as the camera will swing around unpredictable , the character will suddenly start marching off in a totally different direction when you have n't moved the joystick . As much of this 'game ' involves walking along narrow paths , this is a real pisser.I picked up the controller exactly three time with this game and each time I threw it down in disgust 30 minutes later . I guess I 'm a slow learner . If they the game out and just left the cut scenes you 'd have something I 'd probably pay $ 5 for but at least I 'd think I 'd gotten value for my money.The game seems designed to irritate and annoy the player . Do n't buy it unless you really enjoy repeating the same boring stuff over and over .	-1
Lacks the polish of its predecessors but a great game in its own right . I originally bought this because people told me it was the same as Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars for SNES . It is NOT ANYTHING like that , but it is another enjoyable series in which I look forward to the next incarnation .	-1
paper mario is very boring at the end of the game there is nothing else to do you ca n't get more exp points.this game has horrible graphics i do n't give a damn if it 's paper . there is really nothing to do at the end of the game .	-1
This is the WORST game I played . At first I thought this game would be excellent because I LOVED Super Mario for the SNES . When I put the game in , I wasted so much time on a LONG and boring intro that you HAVE to watch . 2nd Mario talks to EVREYBODY in the game , which adds to more boredom . May I also include there is no sound ? 3rd , everytime Mario has a battle with a stupid bad guy , it goes into a scene similar to Pokemon . You do your attack , than Mario gets attacked himself ! What is that ? ! If I made the game , I would just make it so Mario and him fought normally ! 4th , the graphics are just terrible.5th , the music REALLY got on my nerves.So ignore the majority of people that say it is the best . In my opinion , the game is sad and just disgraces the N64 .	-1
Tomb Raider : Chronicles ( TRC ) features the lovely Lara Croft in her many adventures from Rome to a U-Boat to a high-tech tower complex . The game has one of the most awkward controls and frustrating adjusting camera angles since Danger Girl ( that 's a cheap game , and one should buy it simply for the art inside and NOT for the game or gameplay ! ) . Anyway , one will keep on falling and falling ... etc . and continously get blindsided by enemies for the most part . Additionally , Lara still moves like a tank with feet , instead of having fluid and sly movement . However , the stealth in the latter levels in particular is a welcome addition , being spoiled by the Metal Gear Solid series . The puzzles are n't too difficult , but they are very physical-oriented as opposed to mental-oriented ( like Eidos ' Fear Effect ) . The cinematics are okay , but they are rather short . My two favorite levels on this game is the U-Boat/Russian Base level and the Tower : Level 13 level . Both of these are reminiscent of Metal Gear Solid . Otherwise , this game is definitely for fans of Tomb Raider previously , but for newbies , definitely rent before you buy .	-1
I got this game hoping , with my writing skills , I could create a masterpiece of an RPG game . But I was wrong . At first I had fun with storyline , making dungeons , characters , and naming and making enemies , items , and all that . I titled it , chose the opening theme , and stuff . I test played it and found out how hard it was to make this game . A great game like Final Fantasy series , Xenogears , Chrono Cross or Breath of Fire series must take ages to make because this is the most time-consuming game I have ever played.The graphics are very NESish , and old , but I liked them at the beginning . Then I got very annoyed with them and how old they looked . It was like I was playing a classic Zelda game , or the great PS1 game Tales of Destiny . I quickly grew bored with this game . Check out some other reviews , one guy from Chicago tells all that I can not type for my hands are very tired . I had fun at first but it all gradually fell down on me and I gave it up . The Anime Maker is very difficult to use and Scenario mode is even harder . A very very difficult game ; you 'll need a strategy guide for this but of course they do n't make one . They include 2 instruction booklets in the CD case that are even difficult to understand . The magic system is horrible and it is all too confusing and hard . Do not buy this game thinking you 'll make a masterpiece . I do n't even know how some people do so .	-1
You 'll need a lot if your going to make a serious adventure . You have a simpler concept to use , since it is mapped out for you in text windows . The game itself is simple too annoying to play . After seven hours , I completed one half-finished village . Imagine how long for the whole game . Plus you need to use the playstation controller to write out anything that your characters will say . Scripted events are near impossible to make , bug testing is not fun , and you will start to go insane at the point of 20 hours.Whenever you hear someone say & quot ; I Could Make A Better Game Than That ! & quot ; shove this game in their face . It ought to put him ( or her ) in their place . Only recommended for the extremely super patient .	-1
Do n't let the cool box art fool you . This game is just the opposite of what the box art suggests . It suggests fun , great visuals , and a stellar , epic storyline . In ( game ) reality , the fun comes in very small , almost untraceable doses , the visuals offer a palette of dark colors that blend the setting with characters and items , and the storyline is neither epic nor stellar . If that does n't chase you from the game , then the rest of this review most definitely will.The Good : + The level-up system is actually rather good+ The dialogue will make you laugh -- whether it 's meant to or notThe Bad : -- Somebody let this game out into the market -- Long sequences of boring combat -- Many people might not even find their way out of the first castleThe Ugly : : ( The character and monster designsStoryline -- 1/10Unfortunately the script-writers do n't provide the characters with any intelligent dialogue . In fact , it 's laughable . The game does n't take itself very seriously , which makes things even worse . Take for example what the main character , Alaron , says when the party stops to rest . They sit before a campfire and the camera zooms on Alaron 's face . He says , `` Ah ! Pass the marshmallows . '' Not only is this not very funny , but it grows annoying when you have to watch this scene every time your party rests . The best line of dialogue , though , belongs to the knight , Abrecan . When the king sends Alaron on a quest and offers as a reward to make Alaron ( who is at the time a squire ) a knight , Abrecan objects . He continuously insults his king by saying , `` You are too generous . '' And each time he repeats those words , more and more of them become capitalized , expressing Abrecan 's abhorrent anger for the king allowing this young squire a chance to become a knight . Compared to that line of dialogue , nothing else is worth remembering.Gameplay -- 1/10Many of you may not find your way out of the labyrinthine castle you start out in , but for those who do you 'll do some questing and searching through the not-so-labyrinthine-but-still-difficult-to-navigate outside areas . Most importantly , you 'll be battling bad guys . That 's what you bought the game for , right ? To battle bad guys ? For this , the game developers bumped their heads together and thought , `` What is so fun about video games ? '' They made a list , narrowed it down to `` What 's so fun about RPGs , '' and then , for the fun of it , made a list of `` What would not be fun in an RPG . '' But somebody accidentally slipped this last list to the developers and threw out the other one . Thus the combat that lasts 10 to 20 minutes and consists of lots swinging and missing . I swear , the chance to hit in this game is about as low as the chance to miss in other games . There are so many factors that go against your chance to hit that there just is no hitting . And when you reach a high enough level to actually start hitting the enemies , you move on to the next area where the enemies are stronger and , thus , harder to hit . ARGGHH ! ! ! Back to square one.On the bright side , the experience system is rather good . You can put points into different skills for each character , giving you a lot of freedom for customization . Too bad the rest of the game could n't have been so fun and original.Longevity -- 1/10As I said , many of you will probably never leave the castle , where poor Alaron will breathe his last , but for those fortunate ( or unfortunate ) enough to make it out and go on your quest , there 's a lengthy quest here . Much of it consists of long battles between incompetent fighters , and very little of it consists of an engaging story . In the end , it would be much more merciful to allow Alaron to live out the rest of his days lost in the castle .	-1
A diamond in the rough ... covered with bugsGosh I so wanted to like this game . There 's a lot to like . The gameworld is huge - you could spend hours exploring it . The story is immersive enough to keep you interested . The combat sequences can be kind of long , but never get boring . Plus you have a large number of party-member combinations which changes the direction of the story . I could go on , but others have extolled about the virtues of the game better than I could.The game feels kind of unfinished , like a piece of coal that is n't quite a diamond . THQ boasts a gameworld larger than both Zeldas combined , and this is certainly true . I spent about an hour trekking from the castle town to the first village - travelling takes a LONG time - and while the scenery changes alot ( from forest to lakes to snow-capped peaks ) there 's not all that much to DO . After the initial & quot ; Gee that 's pretty & quot ; factor , traveling from town to town becomes an effort in patience . The towns also feel kind of empty . There are a couple of people walking around , and about a dozen houses ( only a few with people in them ) . I know that the memory constraints are tight , so they could n't have included everything they would have liked , but that 's the sacrifice you make for such a huge gameworld . I 'm not sure this is a good thing . A smaller , detailed , more interactive gameworld is always better than a huge , sprawling , empty one , in my opinion.Aidyn Chronicles is also , I 'm sorry to say , a bug ridden mess . A few times my main character got stuck in scenery ( trees & amp ; walls ) and I was n't able to get him out . But , the most unforgivable thing was the huge number of errors & amp ; crashes I encountered . I played for an hour , gathered & amp ; equiped my party , and set off on my quest , only to talk to a villager and have the game give me an error message and die on me . I started over , this time saving frequently . I reached a certain point and my saved game became corrupted , forcing me to start over again . This time I kept a back-up saved game . I reached a bit further only to have BOTH saved games get corrupted . By this point I was so frustrated tip-toeing around the game 's bugs that I gave up and put the game up for auction on eBay.This is a major shame , because the storyline was interesting enough to make me want to continue ( long treks and empty towns nonwithstanding ) . Maybe if you 've got more patience than me , this is a game worth having .	-1
This game is garbage because of the few modes you can play and limited wrestlers . Sure it is good to get 9 wreslters into the ring at one time and it is kind of fun to fight in the parking lot near the street . But once you play it for a week or less , you get really tired of it . I suggest selling your Dreamcast and buying a PS2 or an XBOX which both have better ( wrestling ) games . Thats why dreamcast went broke . It had such good potential but the people did not put enough good games . Most were too much arcade like games that you got tired of . The rest was all sports . Well actually mostly all the games are better than dreamcast on the XBOX and PS2 .	-1
lets just get this straight when i bought royal rumble i was looking for the next smackdown.One problem it nothing like smackdown first of all there are only 2 modes a regular one on one match or a royal rumble where there can be 9 people in the ring at one time . Yes i know the royal rumble match sounds cool but it is as boring as a one on one match.In other words this game gets one star for being fun for 5 minutes .	-1
Well it 's safe to say that all the WWF games for the dreamcast . Just keep on walking and get something else .	-1
For those of you who actually like Royal Rumble for the Dreamcast I must say that you are deprived ! If you want the best wrestling game on the Dreamcast go track down `` Fire Pro D Wrestling '' , an import game.This game has over 200 wrestlers and the most indepth create a player mode found in ANY wrestling game . Heck you can even edit the origional given wrestler costumes , wan na see Bret Hart in a blue jeans , then just edit one of his costumes . Wan na see the Rock in a shiny gold shirt and long black dress pants , then just edit one of his costume choices . You can edit costumes for everyone if you like , from Andre the Giant to Hulk Hogan to Dallas Page to Goldberg to Vader to Shawn Michaels to Chyna to Ric Flair to Y2J to Hawk and Animal and any of the japaneese wrestlers.EVERYTHING you want in a wrestling game is HERE ! ! It also supports 4 players and NEVER suffers from any slowdown.The cast of characters Fire Pro D range from stars from the WWF , WCW , UFC ( yes Ultimate Fighter Championships ) and numerous wrestling organisations in Japan . This game rocks ! There are numerous game modes like Royal Rumble , Battle Royal , Survivor Series , 3 man tag , 4 man tag , 2 man tag , single match , cage match , barb wire match , submission matches and MORE . This has the MOST moves per character in ANY wrestling game . I dare any Smackdown fan to compare the two , they will loose BADLY ! ! ! Overall the game is what a wrestling game on the Dreamcast should be and not the disappointing mess called Royal Rumble ! ! IMPORT THIS GAME , ITS A MUST HAVE ! ! !	-1
This is not a very Good Wrestling Game ... NO mercy for the N64 was the best..get that..This game is very dull ... the controls are alright but a bit clunky..I though it was fun for about 1 hour..Very bad Dream Cast game ... AND THERE ONLY WRESTLING GAME ... But that does n't really matter since Dream Cast has some of the Best Games ever made..This game just plain sucked ... Do n't buy it ... Later ...	-1
This has to be the worst WWF wrestling game i have ever played . Their are no create a wrestler options , no season modes , limited choices in wrestlers.control get screwed up at times . the game certainly does not take advantage of the Dream Cast hardware . I 've played this game for about 30 minutes and simply became disgusted . Do yourself a favor and get something else	-1
I am serious . This game is the worst wrestling game ever made next to WCW Nitro for Playstation but it ranks up there with it . This game has two modes , no endings , 20 Characters , no entrances lame move sets and looks like a really nice textured Smackdown . I suggest u rent it for a night and when ure ready to throw it out the window return it . THQ failed at making a game and im appauled at the way this games average review is 4 stars . THIS GAME IS BAD ! And this is coming from a gamer of 20 years ... .	-1
I got this game from BlockBuster ( I did not buy it ) I was thinging o cool this is cool I got home played it ... . THIS GAME WAS SO SO bad well not that bad but WM2000 and no mecry is 100 % better then this . Its ture its ture.Thats all .	-1
American Idol could be the worst game of the year , just by the looks of it.. Look at how bad it is . The grapics are horrible . They are some of the worst graphics ever seen on Playstation 2 . I saw some screen shots . There are many Dreamcast games that look better than this . I bet its boring too . I heard it took only ONE hour to beat . ONE hour . ONE HOUR ! ! ! $ 50 for one hour ! Are you people insane ? Spending $ 50 for one hour of gameplay , probably with no replay value either . The show may be horrible , but I have a feeling this may be worse .	-1
This is just a flat out horrible game . When I first heard American Idol would be making its debut as a video game , I immediately knew it would be a horrible idea , and it was . Bad bad bad.The fact that the game puts too much thought and effort into selecting a hairstyle and dressing up your teenage Idol character just makes the game stink even more . As for the actual singing part , well , pressing buttons on the controller JUST the right way will help you stay in tune with the musical notes you hear . This is n't any fun , though . Avoid .	-1
If you have a four year old that has , for some reason , an affinity for prefab pop music , then this might be the game for you . For the rest of us , this is a waste of money and time . Wow , you get to choose the costumes and the hairstyles ! That is hardly what I call gameplay . As for the gameplay itself -- - if you know the difference between a triangle , circle , etc . then you are 90 % percent of the way there . Again , your preschool tots might find this a little daunting , but they will be the only ones . One reviewer compared this to the old game SIMON , but that game emphasized good memory skills above everything else and is in fact still more challenging than this pre-fab nonsense . Save your money and your time & avoid this boring , unchallenging garbage .	-1
I do n't mind the barely-better-than-ps1 look of the graphics . The graphics were good enough . I was getting into the story , combat was interesting , I liked the way characters leveled up , the side-quests were often amusing , looking forward to summoning all sorts of monsters until ... I could n't even get past the first big city when one bug after another combined the make the game distasteful . I 'm sure it 's possible to work around some of the bugs except , at MOST , this is just an average RPG and it 's not worth trouble to fight the bugs when there are dozens to hundreds of playable RPGS that ARE N'T so buggy.I was impressed enough by what I did see in the game that I 'm likely to give Summoner II a shot - very few bug complaints on that game .	-1
I love a good RPG . Their is nothing like exploring a new world . Taking on a new life . In short getting away from yourself for a while . A good RPG will do that . It 's too bad nobody told the people at THQ about any of that.This game could be summed up in one word . Boring . Nothing much happens . When it does , you hardly notice . It 's story does nothing to draw you in.The graphics are ok at best . Not the game to show off your PS2 that is for dang sure . Pop-in is horrible and I am surprised how Sony let this little gem slip by for the launch . Not really a game that shows off what the system can do.Some odd things make it into the game . The people for one thing . They are in a word , ugly and so is the guy you control . I am not sure what the artists were thinking but ... These are some ugly folk ! I am not saying they are not well done , they are . The problem is that they actually look ugly . Very odd choice.The game play is so boring you may find that after about 20 min , you just do n't care anymore . The Quests are boring . The locations are boring . Even the story is ho-hum . Nothing much is going on in this world.The music and voice acting are quite good but the game just never gets any momentum going . It feels lifeless and your role in that world seems aimless.A good RPG is a work of art . A gentile balance of game and story line . If FinalFantsty and Zelda are like a Pollock or a Picasso then this game is paint by numbers portrait of a clown and some balloons .	-1
Upon starting Summoner for the PS2 , I was immediately dismayed by the & quot ; Now Loading & quot ; screen thrust at me before anything even started . I waited for about ten seconds , only to learn that the loading was simply to throw a quick THQ logo onscreen . To add to that , the loading for actual in-game play is much longer . You can actually walk to the kitchen and grab a drink , come back , and still see the loading screen . As for the gameplay , the so-called & quot ; combo & quot ; system is simply engaging in combat , and pressing in one of four ways on the directional pad during combat . The combat is extremely stiff , and aside from random grunts and moans , nothing special . The overworld movement is not too bad , however , with the camera keeping up fairly well with the main character . Graphically , this game is a disaster . Choppy framerates , draw-in that is downright laughable , and a graininess that would of been criticized even on the PSOne . At one point , you enter a harbor area , and see the open skies ahead of you . However , as you step forward , you see a castle form not even 500 yards ahead of you , causing a friend of mine to joke that they had a cloaking device . In terms of sound , the music is quite nice , really . The failure comes through in the aforementioned combat . With that exception , I have no real gripes about the audio . The game itself would be very well had these flaws been dealt with . The storyline is intriguing , and the characters are fairly well designed . The quests are enough to keep you occupied for some time , and varied enough to avoid boring you . The dialogue is splendid as well . Overall , Summoner is a potentially good game gone horribly bad . Obviously rushed before the draw-in , combat , and graphic errors could be corrected , the mark was missed . Hopefully this will be a lesson learned for THQ .	-1
Hmm ... I 'll start with what 's good : the game is fairly fun , it has a reasonably cool skill system , there 's enough side-quests to keep you entertained much longer than the game actually takes to beat , the characters have some amount of depth ( and differ rather greatly ) , the graphics are fairly nice , the music is quite good , the voice actors fit very well with their characters , it 's the best rpg-ish game on the PS2 ( which , honestly , is n't saying much at all ) , and , most importantly , it has a great hidden movie ( press X in the credits ) .Now for the bad : there are enough random side quests to make the most hardened player of BG2 cry , and very few of them give you the option to not take them on . That means if you only want to do a few of them , you 'll have to sort through the ones you do n't want in your quest menu . Also the character AI is the worst I 've seen since Warcraft 2 . Characters will run off on their own to initiate a battle across the battle map , or will throw fireballs at enemies that are healed by fire while your other characters in the blast radius get hurt ( after the same attack on the same enemy has failed to have a positive effect the last 20 times it 's been tried ) . The sound cuts out all the time ( probably one out of five areas/encounters has only the background music and footstep sounds ) and I have yet to hear the sound from the Dragon summons . Probably the most frustrating thing is the messed up experience system . I wo n't go into great detail here , but after 20th level , you need 20 times as much experience per level , but still get it at the same rate ... .and you 're getting fewer skill points.So why does this get such a low rating ? The real reason is that while it 's on the Playstation 2 , it seems like it was given as much effort as the average Super Nintendo game ... .from graphics to sound to depth of game , it 's an inferior game taking up the shelf space of a superior system .	-1
This games graphics are awesome , but the one thing I hate about it is the way the dialogue is . It is in light blue in a dark blue box , and I ca n't see it for the life of me ! I play in a bright room too ! I have n't gotten very far , but the game has n't inspired me to do it . A real disappointment .	-1
The graphics on this game were very disapointing and the gameplay is not too great either . Only reason I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because there is a storyline , something many games are lacking now-a-days . I would not have bought this game if I had taken a closer look at the graphics .	-1

The Grinch is back in full force and it looks like Konami has tried to capture his essence in this poorly made game . Konami has made some dynamite games ( Castlevania : Symphony of the Night and Metal Gear Solid to name a few ) , so it comes as a shock that they 've let this thing slip out the door . It 's sad that many unsuspecting and well-intentioned parents will pick this one up thinking that their child will enjoy it . This game is horrible , pure and simple . Every level consists of the same challenges so boredom sets in fast . The graphics go from awful to horrendous , and back to awful if you 're lucky . The pop-up is here and it 's in charge . For instance , in the first level I played , the Grinch was on a ledge that completely disappeared when I moved him slightly . And on many occasions , the insides of buildings would stick out through the roofs and walls , making for a very unattractive gaming experience . I hope I 've made it clear that the Grinch is a gift no man , woman or child , should receive .	-1
I played this game last Xmas , and within about 10 minutes I wanted to put it back in the box and throw it up the chimney . Maybe I was just missing something , or maybe this game is absolutely horrible . Someone else on here said they could n't figure out the 1st world ; I 'm with you ... I do n't get this game .	-1
This game is soooo fun , but sooooo many bugs . You think thats nothing ? Trust me , what a pain in the bum . Glitches , stalls , ugh . I have two copies for playstation and both have the same problems . YET , if you buy it knowing and expecting bugs , or if it 's ever re-released without them , this could be your favorite game ever . Puzzle action without being lame ... so grinchy .	-1
This game is tedious and boring . You use the same dumb tricks to beat different characters in lame looking arenas.Avoid Ready 2 Rumble 2 . I love sport games but this just sucked.Why do I have to give it a star ... .c'mon Amazon put a minus feature in place for game like this	-1
After playing the demo version of this game , I was sure the complete game would be a blast . The demo offered clean graphics and quick gameplay , though it was hampered by an incredibly simplistic story . Still , it made me want to play the game.After renting & quot ; Threads of Fate , & quot ; though , I have to say that Square has let me down again . Though this one 's not nearly as bad as some of their other bombs ( & quot ; Legend of Mana & quot ; and & quot ; SaGa Frontier & quot ; ) , & quot ; Threads of Fate & quot ; is still a far cry from a good game.The major faults of & quot ; Threads of Fate & quot ; include the boring dialogue , skimpy storyline , bad camera angles , and awkward control . To put it simply -- you have to get through a lot of nonsense just to get to the gameplay , but even that is n't so hot.You 'll run into lots of annoying features in the battle mode , such as zoomed-in shots that prevent you from navigating effectively and annoying jumps or unclear exits.There is some fun , though -- the battles themselves are n't too bad , though they end up as hack-and-slash fests more than anything else . Having two characters to play is one of the game 's few saving graces . It 's especially fun playing as Rue and changing into the enemies you just killed.All in all , Square is starting to slip , in my opinion , and games like this only prove my point . & quot ; Threads of Fate & quot ; is worth a rental , but do n't expect anything grand.Graphics : A- Gameplay : B- Music & amp ; Sound : COverall : B-	-1
IM sorry to say I have to give a bad rating because the game just would not play as if it were blank the company would do well to check the games before they sell them if I didnt test or check things before I work on my clients I would lose clients . Also I threw away the bag thinking there was no need for it so I could n't return it and my kid was really upset . PLEASE test you Games before Selling Sheesh !	-1
As an adult I find this game extremely boring . Basically you are a little dragon and hop around to recover dragon eggs stolen by some evil beings . Your primary weapons are your body and the fire coming out of your mouth . The graphics is very simple ( ok , maybe because I have a PS2 I keep forgetting this game was designed for PSX ) , and the controls ( like most Sony games ) are more complicated than necessary . The gameplay is repetitive and very tedious . And the characters , when they talk to you , talk in text , not voice . Very lame.If you want to play this game , rent it , do n't waste your money buying it . It 's pretty easy to finish all the levels in a day or two .	-1
What have they done to you D ! ? This game had so much potential . Good graphics , great story , and a huge fan base . But they made the game slow , excessively difficult , and bland . I tried , I actually TRIED to like this game , but it was so hard to feign interest in it for more than an hour . I loved the movies , but this is a travesty ! Go Buy the Legacy of Kain series instead	-1
I bought this game used because I liked the movie , and i thought , what the hey , the game will probably be good too . It does deliver on nostalgia , but it is not a fun game to play . I wanted to like this game , but it just has so many flaws.First , and foremost , the movement system . Pushing up on the arrow pad makes you go forward , no matter which way you 're facing . This took me forever to get used to , and even then i never entirely got the hang of it . It makes fighting enemies slow and difficult . Would it have been that hard to make the movement normal and use the analog stick ? ! Sigh ... another complaint is that the game is short , the puzzles are irritating and boring , and you never leave this one building . That 's right , the entire game takes place in the same castle ! Which inevitably means that much of the game is comprised of hideous backtracking , over and over again , to find a cardkey and open a door.I do n't know if Im just biased because I 'm used to playing turn-based RPGs , but I found this game incredibly unenjoyable . Its only redeeming quality is that Vampire Hunter D is its subject matter ... . So , my advice is to only buy this if your a fan of Vampire Hunter D , and if you think you can stand it .	-1
Like the other reviewers , I found the gameplay itself to be quite interesting . However , the game has a number of technical problems that render it unplayable in its current form . Namely : CRASHES FREQUENTLY : Not only does it crash often , but it crashes reliably whenever you encounter certain events . One singularly annoying example is that it crashes every time you kill a particular monster . Since you have to kill this monster to proceed with the main story line , this effectively ends the game.VERY SLOW : My computer is actually a bit faster than the requirements on the box , and I find the game ponderously slow . Restoring a saved game takes a whopping 5 MINUTES ! Also , the game has to stop at various points to load new adventuring areas , with similarly long pauses . Let 's just say that you 'll need to have a book handy to read while playing this game . One mysterious delay lies in the fact that that quitting the game WITHOUT A SAVE can sometimes take five minutes or more . In the same amount of time , one can manually terminate the game using the escape key and restart it , so I have no idea what the computer is doing during all this time.There is also a modest problem with game balance . Virtually all of the monsters in the game are push overs . They 're so easy , that you wo n't even bother to cast your enhancing spells -- they 're just not worth the trouble . Then you finally encounter one of the big monsters , and it 's completely overpowering . Someone really should have paid some more attention game balance back in the design phase.That said , it 's an interesting enough game , and I might take another shot at it once they get around to putting a patch out . Until they release a patch , however , I would strongly discourage anyone from buying this game .	-1
Alot of people are going to say that two stars is unfair for a game that has such great graphics and playability ... i understand where you 're coming from if you think that , because this game looks great and is VERY fun . But it is way too graphically violent for me . I dont have anything against shooting games in general , I love Counter Strike and IGI , and Unreal Tournament was good back in the day , but Wolfenstein ups the ante way beyond simple kill and be killed gameplay , going to extremes like depictions of torture and mutilation . Even though i can spend hours shooting enemies in the head while playing Medal of Honor , and enjoy lopping off limbs in Rune , playing Castle Wolfenstein is , for me , completely demoralizing and dehumanzing . I dont play it because of that , and any game I wont play ca n't get better than two stars.By the way , this game is banned in Germany . But that might just be because of the anti-German sentiment as much as the violence .	-1
Maybe the game had too much hype , but after nearly completing the single player and playing the multi-player for several weeks , I am rather disappointed . The single player missions for the most part are boring and repetitive . I 'm comparing it to Half-Life and it is nowhere even close to the quality of the single player . What is really shocking are the graphic defects present in the game - guns appearing through walls , dead soldiers hovering a few feet above ground , some cheesy AI , but better than most . The multiplayer is much more enjoyable , and uses many of the single player maps . I 'll be selling it and buying Medal of Honor when it comes out .	-1
Contrary to popular belief , this title is not part of the Civilization series . This is Activision 's attempt at a Civ clone . In some areas it succeeds , but in most it fails . This game had no affiliation with Sid Meier , creator of CivI and II ( the latter arguably the best pc strategy game ever ) .Pros : Good government selection . Some new governments are included , like Fascism , Technocracy , Theocracy , Ecology , Corporate Republic , etc.Armies and Fleets . In CivII a stack of units could be killed in what attack . This is not so.Automated Improvements . The government automatically does terrain improvements.Diplomacy and Trade : Both are well planned and fairly extensive.Cons : Diplomacy and Trade : Neither are used to their full extent , and if you try , other civilizations refuse . There 's all types of stuff , like trade embargoes , etc , but the AI never does them.Civilizations : Over 30 Civs to choose from , but there 's really no difference in between them . Also , whenever I play , I 'm always up against the same Civs : French , British , German , Irish , Scottish , American , and Native Americans . That gets boring very fast.Slow : The interface is slow , even on a 128MB Ram P3 500mhz machine.Scenarios : Only 4 of them , and none are any good.NO CUSTOMIZATION OF UNITS OR CIVS : In Civ2 anyone could make their own units , terrains , technologies , scenarios , maps , etc . You ca n't do any of this in CTP2.Conclusion : Civ3 should be out in the US within 2 months , it 's coming to Mac , and to Europe . Civ3 has Sid Meier working on it . Civ3 has elaborate diplomacy and trade . Civ3 has culture points , great military leaders , many unit animations , civ specific units , new paths to victory , total customization of units , civs , techs , maps , etc , has better graphics , more realistic , more units , will ship with 12 scenarios , and so much more . The bottom line : save your cash for Civ3 , it 's just months away .	-1
Personally , I feel ripped off for having wasted money on this product . Like Call to Power 1 , the game has some interesting features , particularly the variety of stealth units . However , the game suffers from a number of MAJOR PROBLEMS . Not only does it appear that the designers never playtested this game , it 's clear that they never went back and played the first Call to Power either ; many glaring problems from the original are still here . The worst problems:1 . WAY TOO MANY BUGS : The game crashes often . Also , there 's a problem with save game files being corrupted that gets progressively worse as the game progresses . -- I finally gave up after a game that I had spent 25 hours on would not reload , even though I had EIGHT seperate save game files from the last EIGHT turns . Every single one of them was corrupted.There are also numerous less catastrophic , but more consistent flaws in the programming . For example , stealth units are supposed to be clandestined . When you are attacked by one , you do n't know who sent it . The computer players , however , always do , and immediately declare war in response to any stealth attack by you.2 . BADLY WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION : Quite frankly , this is the worst rulebook I have ever seen . It 's long winded and repetitive , yet still lacks many key pieces of information . As a result , you have to use trial and error to figure out how much of the game works . One example : the rules mention that you must have military units on hand to control your slaves , but never spells out how many . The right ratio turns out to be 1:3 , but you would n't know that unless your read the rules to Call to Power # 1.3 . WHOLE PARTS OF THE GAME DESIGN JUST DO N'T WORK : While the stealth units are interesting , some of them are so badly designed that they just do n't work . The Cleric , for example , is the chief weapon of the Theocracy , which uses it to go out and convert enemy cities to your faith . This is an expensive and risky operation . However , it is so ridiculously easy to undo this conversion ( station a military unit in the city , endure one turn of mildly elevated unhapiness among the citizens ) that no player ( computer or human ) ever allows a city to remain converted for more than one turn . So why bother having the cleric unit in the game in the first place ? There are similar extreme problems with other parts of the game , many of them left over from Call to Power 1 . Do these people ever playtest their own products ? 4 . CLUNKY INTERFACE : The interface is badly designed . Information that could easily be put on one screen gets spread out over two or three . For example , information on trade routes that you currently have and those that are still available are placed on different screens . So to compare them and figure out if you have the optimal set of routes requires endlessly flipping back and forth between two screens.Overall , I just do n't see how the designers could have played this game and still released it in the pathetic state that they did . This is the second game that I 've bought from Activision which was released in an unplayable condition . Personally , I 'm swearing off their products in the future.Those interested in a good Civilization type game should probably try Civilization 2 , or better still , Alpha Centauri .	-1
This game is too hard to conquer , because when you try to solve the puzzles with your quick wits , the opponent will keep attacking you , over and over . It makes me both angry and sick , because you have no choice but to keep on dying ! If you want to play puzzle games , I recommend Arkanoid , Buster Bros. and Jack Brothers . This game is not worth playing !	-1
Street Fighter , always one of my favorite fighting games , and one of the few 2d fighters left , and that was ok because it was Street Fighter ! But for some sick reason they decided to move it from lovingly done cartoonish 2d fighters to sub-tekken 3d . Why ? ? ? If you want a 3d fighter , get Tekken Tag . If you want 2d beauty like good-old Street Fighters of the past , sorry .	-1
I do n't know about the rest of you but I 'm just never impressed with the Street Fighter series when it becomes a 3D game . The graphics look terrible . It looks like a 3 year old drew up stick figures and smeered poo on them and said , & quot ; look Mommy , it 's Blanca ! & quot ; Really please , you ca n't tell me that you 're impressed with the same predictable and boring fights with this game ? Honestly , Street Fighter was a game that should have never gone 3D because it just does n't work for the game because even so , you do n't even have that because all you do is go back and forth . You ca n't get stuck in a corner but you also ca n't side step like Tekken.If PS2 really wanted to impress people , releasing Street Fighter Alpha 3 would have been the smarter move . I have to say , I 'm really hoping that another one of these is not in the making .	-1
All of the Street Fighter EX games ( the ones in 3D ) have been pretty bad . This one is no different . While it easily has the best graphics in the series , it should still look better for a 128-bit game . Capcom should have tweaked the controls , but it 's obvious they rushed this one . Try Tekken Tag Tournament .	-1
TTT was supposed to be the best fighting game ever , well I 'm here to tell you it is n't . The graphics are pretty good , but not much else . It 's enivitibility that really kills TTT because inevitibly after a few weeks this game will get boring , and will end up collecting dust on your shelf . Ignore all the 5-star reviews at ... , trust me , TTT does n't live up tothe hype .	-1
Wheres the 3D motions ? Wheres the excitement ? Wheres my refund ? I bought it , I played it and then I stuck it in a time capsul and buried in my backyard . Hopefully Tekken 4 will have some , I do n't know , uhm entertaining qualities you deserve from a PS2 game !	-1
Stay away from this game it is terrible . I liked NFL BLITZ a lot and thought that this may be a bit simmular . There are a lot of differences but the main one is that NFL BLITZ is good . With terrible sound play control and too little characters this game bites the big one . Do not even rent it .	-1
I really see no reason to buy this game , you can beat it within 45 minutes if you can even stand playing it that long . Its only remotely fun when you play in 2 player mode . The characters add some spark but not enough to save this horrrible game . If you lik boxing , you might like it , but thats abouy it . Youll get bored with this game very fast so i highly reccomend knockout kings instead of this . There are much better ps2 games out there , so get out out and explore , just esort to this as a rent .	-1
Good : You get a free case for the CD ? Bad.No jump button.Linear game play ( You use a button to access doors and stairs , what is this 1985 ? ) Clunky controls . Its like driving an RC car where you have to mentally reverse your thinking when the car is coming toward you versus going away . This is totally lame and makes the game practically unplayable.Did I mention no jump button ? I paid $ 5 and would have had more fun had I kept the money and A ) made a paper airplane with it or B ) set it on fire and watched the delightful glow.Buy Devil May Cry 3 and have a blast . Avoid this one	-1
The game arrived in a timely manner . Ripped open the package put it in and loaded it up . Looked great at first glance , do n't recall the intro specifically . The game play started and the directional buttons are used to control the mighty warlord . The joystick has been used with nearly every game I 've played in the last ten years or more . In fact prior to home arcades all of the games used joysticks . This feature flaw was enough for me to turn off the game and not even bother . If you can get over that and play and enjoy it I say have at it ! I know it 's been done .	-1
when you start playing you start yawning.The problem with games with pre-rendered backgrounds is that it completely ruins the pacing of an action game . If you look at any action film these days the camera and the elements being filmed all move.This kind of cinematorgraphy goes back to the days of film before D. W. Griffith . Ie set the camera down and let the actor run around until he leaves the room . Then set the camera down in a new location and repeat.If you like games like Resident Evil or Fear Effect this game is for you . Also if you like solving awkward puzzles , this game is for you . Any time one has to put an awkward puzzle into a game to mix up the game play means that one is totally out of ideas for the game . Like still cameras , awkward puzzles break the pacing of the game .	-1
I 'll expected more , but your playable and your graphics are no good . The history yes , is very good , but no the another things from this game .	-1
This game has frustrating puzzles , and the gameplay is exactly like Devil May Cry , it 's not funny . The story is so cliched , too . SAVE THE PRINCESS ! Also , it 's not realistic . The 1st boss is so stupid , a 3-year old could 've made him . Only good thing is the graphics , but that 's it .	-1
the only reason im going to give it 2 instead of one is bc of the quality of graphics but the game playing sucks .. i dont know wat is lamer walking around repetively hacking slashing the same creatures over again or the bosses who are just overgrown blowhards who take a couple of shots u need no real stradegy to beat them ... also , i dont dig the storyline or want a storyline ... i mean ur a japense ninja equiped with japense fine steel u would expect a great fighting game not some cinematic movie clips	-1
This game looked enticing ... but I did n't realize from the cover that this is just a souped-up resident evil clone . Granted that the graphics are pretty good and the gameplay is pretty fast , but there 's not much to the game beyond that.Go to the next area , kill the monsters there ( without the Resident Evil save-your-ammo-like-your-life-depends-on-it stratedgy which made Res Evil games so edgy ) , get the item , solve the obligatory puzzle , repeat . The 'horror ' aspect of Resident Evil games is completely gone which makes this one a bit heavy on the cheesy and not-so-challenging side.It 's also REAL short.Good graphics , not so go voice overs , not too compelling storyline ( save the princess ... groan ! ) .I was disappointed , but I guess I might be in the minority .	-1
After playing games like Knockout Kings 2001 , and Madden 2001 I start to question whether EA Sports developed this game or some newbies who threw stuff together . First of all & quot ; real time & quot ; commentary , forget it . The commentary in the game ... . When you go from track to track during the career mode you 've got the same stupid commentator saying & quot ; So and so really moved in the point standing after last weeks race. & quot ; , they say this EVERY time . How hard is it to record a few different statements ? The graphics are okay and the physics engine is pretty good but not good enough to make up for the rest of the game . They should have added more to the career mode , like getting offers from sponsers depending on how you 're doing . Hiring and firing crew chiefs and spending your earnings to keep you car running and to buy upgrades and stuff . When the ... will game developers learn that they are leaving out most of the reality in these games ? Rent it , beat it , and buy something else.And one more thing , if you rent it DO N'T turn on the rear view mirror or the whole game is as choppy as the ocean during a hurricane .	-1
Heads up ... this is one of the best games I 've played , but I 've never finished a session ( or three slopes in a row for that matter ) without the game crashing . I own ten other PS2 titles , this is the only one that has issues , so I know it is n't the console.If you can run it without porblems , it 's the greatest game out there.Sorry for the bad news , folks .	-1
I really was expecting the original SSX to be like Tricky or number 3 . Disappointed . The controls are very awkward , when i want to flip/spin , its impossible ! The levels seemed too oddly designed for snowboarding . Also the overall features are extremely limited .	-1
First let me explain that I have never played this game . Now with that said , let me say that this game is probably terrible . The only person who will play this game is Brian B because he eats and sleeps soccer . He is THE soccer enthusiast . He refuses to buy or rent any other ps2 games , showing severe disregard for his friends ' at work professional advice . He also is a huge rem and live fan . God forbid .	-1
essentially , konami needed some loot for christmastime : their solution , releasing this and gradius.The graphics in this are a must see . They are creepy . The players look like showroom dummies animated to exact their revenge on the olympics.The gameplay is the opposite of confusing . I do n't really understand how & quot ; press buttons fast & quot ; can be confusing , especially since they pummel how to play into your head before each event.I rented it , and took it back after 5 hours and got a different game because i had gotten gold in each event the 2nd time trying.Maybe konami had a deal with sony to invent a game that would only break your controllers ...	-1
Trying as hard as it can this game lurches , lunges and sprints to a finish with a gold medal in crappyness.This & quot ; Olympics & quot ; simulation offers people the chance to compete in some true tests of player patience.At it 's core this game is nothing more than Hyper Olympics . Why they chose to dump this game on the PS2 is beyond me . The game play is puzzling at best . Logic has no place in this game and it makes that ... clear early on.I made the grave error of inviting some friends over to play . We would relive our days in the arcade playing Hyper Olympics . Needless to say all we did was boggle at how such a game could have been made.I can not go into how the controls worked because I am STILL not sure ! The on screen explanations are sad and are nothing more than clues tossed to the players . It 's pretty clear that part of the challenge of this game is how to actually play it.Exasperation sets in very early . In record time in fact as this game has THE worse music my poor ears have ever come across . I am sure we would all agree that the sprit of the Olympics is best summed up in some very bad heavy rock music . Right ? ? If you own a Sega and would like to point at a PS2 and say & quot ; The PS2 [ stinks ] ! & quot ; this is the game to have running on it when you point .	-1
What a great concept they had . And what a shoddy pile of junk the resultant game turned out to be . Evil Dead : Hail to the King held my attention for precisely 10 minutes before the novelty wore off and I was left with nothing except a great sadness , knowing I had spent my hard-earned cash on one of the worst games ever to grace the Playstation.The game gets an F on all fronts . Its main drawing card was that it got Bruce Campbell involved to do voice work and help with concept , but the fact is , there is n't nearly enough variety in the wisecracks , comic situations and Ash 's activities . There 's nothing here that has n't been done infinitely better in the Evil Dead movies . The computerized graphical representations of the Evil Dead characters are just pathetic ( check out that pale graphic imitation of the title sequence of Army of Darkness ) . And though Bruce Campbell is still one of the most delightfully hammy comic presences out there , after about an hour of hearing him repeat the same half-dozen one-liners every half minute , you 're bound to get bored.This would be okay if the game had been well designed in terms of action , aesthetics , and feel . Noooo . As with so many other games with a strong license/franchise behind it , Evil Dead : Hail to the King abuses this license , using it to attempt to cover up atrocious design . First , the control scheme . It 's bad enough that this game features the single worst use of `` camera angles '' I 've ever seen ( move over , Fighting Force 2 ) , but why , oh why would they force a first-person-view control scheme onto a third-person-perspective game ? Imagine having to play Double Dragon using the controls for Medal of Honor , and you get the ludicrous nature of Evil Dead 's controls . And oh yes , the camera angles -- what makes the designers think it 's a good idea to fix the camera on top of a tree looking down on Ash when you 're trying to fight the undead ? And even while fighting , if you move past the edge of the screen , the action stops so that the game can load a new , closer `` angle '' , which completely kills the flow of the action . Then again , there is n't much in the action anyway -- swing your chainsaw and hope for a hit , twist and turn and mash those buttons . And there are so many enemies , all of whom react in pretty much the same way , that it becomes excessive monotony before long . The fact that the enemies `` respawn '' simply adds to the boredom . The only plus ? Some of the environments look tolerably like the movie . If only you were n't forced to look from those weird eyesores they call `` camera angles '' . This is the worst case of game programmers trying to be filmmakers I 've seen yet.All this adds up to an experience akin to waiting in a doctor 's office for your turn with no magazines and the heat turned up to the max . I do n't care when I kill an enemy , I do n't care when I find a page out of the Necronomicon , and I do n't care when I get slaughtered . The apathy this game gives me is even worse than an ultra-tough game that hangs me out to dry . Stick with the movies ; one minute of Evil Dead 2 contains more action , fun and engagement than an hour spent with this sewer rat of a game .	-1
The only good things I can say about this game is the graphics are good and bruce campbell 's voice acting is good but the gameplay sucks and the game is not fun at all when your chainsaw runs out of fuel in the game and the chainsaw is your most useful weapon in the whole entire game because your shotgun handgun and rifle are all pretty much useless the left handed weapons in Evil Dead A Fistful Of Boomstick like your 3 shotguns and your gatling guns you have and your laucher you have in that game are so much better and so much more useful than the 3 left handed weapons you have in Evil Dead Hail To The King this game sucks ass .	-1
I love the films , I think the game set up is great , familular and fun . I think the graphics are okay by PS standards , but ... The Control is AWFUL ! ! ! The came is set up like a keyboard game for PC , up , back and ... spin ? ? ? Yes , left and right spin the Ash ! ! ! You have to spin him , then press up for forward , spin , press up , spin , press up.Walking left ... ? SPIN , PRESS UP ! ! ! Walking right ... ? SPIN , PRESS UP ! ! ! Want to fight ? ? ? Too bad , your behind a tree , a wall , a rock and ca n't see your self to ... are you ready ? ? ? Spin , then press up ... Did they play it before they released it ? I ca n't believe they did.Love the movies , hate the game.Buy Fistful of Boomstick ! Still too hard a game , but it plays correctly and that matters alot.Now , if they would just make a real game they might learn there 's a real market out there .	-1
The first foray of the cult Evil Dead horror movie series into video games began here with Evil Dead : Hail to the King . Using the Resident Evil formula of pre-rendered backgrounds with 3-D animated characters , Evil Dead suffers from poor polygon designs , clunky controls , and the same `` find the key to open the door '' type gameplay we 've seen in games like the Resident Evil series and Alone in the Dark . Evil Dead star Bruce Campbell lends his voice to Ash and breathes some life into this otherwise dismal game , but the terrible control layout and configuration really bring this game down . The Dreamcast version was a bit better with improved graphic and sound quality , but all in all Evil Dead : Hail to the King is worth checking out for fans of the Evil Dead series or survival horror games only .	-1
The story is something like this : after the Army Of Darkness movie , Ash gets a new girlfriend . But he has nightmares , and he decides to go back to the cabin ( which was destructed in Evil Dead II ) , to end this once and for all . The cabin is well-clean and everything ( where 's the connection with Evil Dead II , partners ? ) . But Ash 's girlfriend is kidnapped by Bad Ash ( more like Evil Dead II 's then Army Of Darkness ' ) . Your objective is to find six Necronomicon pages throughout the game , a boring task , I must say . And you also have to save your girlfriend . That 's what you have to do ... While you move on , you might notice that , if you 're a hard fan like myself , the game is only fun while you 're walking inside or around the cabin , those familiar scenaries . All the rest is boring ... The graphics are OK for a PSOne game , for all I 've played.. Trees move , the fog moves.. No big deal , but it 's ok ... The sound is good too , Bruce Campbell does great voice acting ( as seen in other games too ) . But it 's not fun . And that 's a big problem . Deadites keep coming and coming , some enemies are really tough , and you do n't feel like you 've finnished a masterpiece when you beat this game ... It was a try , but I wish THQ can learn from its mistakes to make a cool sequel . In the educational point the game is not approved.. It 's Mature-classified , you see.. There is a little blood , violence.. But no big things , you can let your grown-up children play it ... Unless you are a hard Evil Dead fan and you want to have one more item for your collection , do n't buy this game . It 's my opinion .	-1
I really enjoyed every evil dead movie growing up . They scared me at times when my parents would watch em , but as I grew older not so much . I own all the movies so when I saw that I had missed this for dreamcast i picked it up for 10 dollars or so . Wow ... Did anyone even test this ? Did I get a bootlegged fake copy ( I know I didnt ) ? This is horrible . I tried to like this game ... really I did ! Nothing Flows ... Horrible Camera + Dreaded Graphics x Unforgivable controls - any fun what so ever = Evil Dead Hail to the KingI 'm serious guys ... this is bad . I 'm talking Like Crack bad . Your filled with excitement you got it for only ten bucks or so but when you get it started 10 minutes later you just feel horrible ...	-1
Sure this is an Evil Dead game but whos kidding . This game is n't that great . Games based on movies usually suck But I gave this game a try ( yes the Dreamcast version of course ) and it was n't all that gret.The graphics are ok I guess . The controlls suck . Gameplay is dull otherwise if you love Evil Dead and want to try out the games steer clear away from this hunk of junk . It 's your choice but trust me it 's not worth the money . Crappy game.I give this a 2 out of 5 stars ... Lates	-1
Unless you are a real snowboarder ( which I am not ) and into watching ESPN Winter X-Games 24-7 you will prob . think this game really sucks ... for the money buy SSX Tricky , and thank me later ... .	-1
I love the game when I get to the snowboarding parts , but its way too much work getting to ride . The graphics are really sweet . I love the way snow gets kicked up into the camera when you land , but I dont know if I can get over the glaringly annoying features of this game:1 ) I feel like I am playing one of those Barbie dress-up games when I get to buy coats , pants , and goggles , give me a break . New equipment such as boards and bindings make sense , but jackets ? ! ? ! 2 ) Too much menu wrangling to get to the actual game play . If I lose a competition , there is no retry button . You have to go back to the lodge and walk over to the cheesy box head guy and enter all over again . Then at the end of the run you have to choose between replay and proceed , with the default always being proceed . Its just a major hassle . They should learn from Tony Hawk . They have it down.3 ) Too much loading , especially in multiplayer session stuff . Nobody likes spending more time loading than playing.4 ) Not enough thought put into the session competitions . For instance , there is one race with rails and windy , narrow lanes that have huge drop-offs on either side , if you fall off either side , you lose . It ends rather abrubtly this way , right before either player can get into it . Why not just send the rider back to the beginning of the course ?	-1
This is simply a joke , christmas fodder . If you enjoy playing this over other ps2 games you must not like utilizing the full capability of your expensive system.Truth of the matter is : konami needed to make up the costs of the developers kit , so it releases a few lame games which will be rented and bought just out of sheer lack of launch titles.The only way this game could have been valid would be if there was a gradius 5 in it as well that is actually GOOD and utilizing that emotion engine.The only emotion evoked by renting this game was pure sorrow . I guess this is what I get for utilizing an emulator to play these games a few years ago .	-1
No offense to old-school shooters or their fans , but this is a pretty weak excuse for a PS2 launch title . Sony 's & quot ; ultimate game machine & quot ; ( or whatever tagline they 're using ) should be able to easily handle the first and second Gradius installments , along with these two , on a single disc . Where are they ? I hate to say it but Konami is n't giving us a whole lot of bang for our buck ( which is unusual for them ) .Sure , the new intro is nice , but what about the games themselves ? I think Father Time has a way of exaggerating our sense of nostalgia , especially where video games are concerned . Some games simply do not age well . In the battle between pretty graphics and solid gameplay , I stand firmly on the latter side , but next to the best shooters of the post 16-bit era ( such as Einhander and G Darius ) , Gradius III and IV just are n't much fun . The actual shooting is downplayed while too much emphasis is placed on memorizing the enemy patterns and maneuvering your ship so as to avoid becoming instant space junk . Before too long , it ceases to be challenging and just gets annyoing . Get killed and you lose all your power ups . Good luck beating a boss with just a speed-up bonus . Plus , there are no continues in Gradius III ! Instead , it uses a lame stage select mode.I know , these were landmark shooters in their heyday , but we should be playing more advanced games that learn and borrow from them , not just recycling them for a new system . I fully support the continuation of 2-D gaming in the 3-D era , but this is not the way to go about doing it . If you really want a traditional shooter for your PS2 , try Silpheed : The Lost Planet instead . Not as much of a challenge , perhaps , but MUCH more enjoyable .	-1
Is this game fun ? Yes . It is fun . But it is not 2001 fun . It is 1995 fun.Does this game belong on this platform ? No.This is an embarassment for Sony to touting these incredible hardware specs and then have a game like this released on this platform . But that 's what happens when third party developers start trying too hard to push games out the door.I 'm waiting for metal gear solid 2 . You should too .	-1
Let me start off by saying that back in the day of the Super Nintendo , I did own Gradius 3 and had an absolute blast with it . The game 's graphics , music and gameplay were standout gorgeous , I loved it . Granted , I have never played Gradius 4 but figured it would be just as good if not better than the G3 that I remember from back in the day . The versions on this PS2 console are an embarrassment to the PS2 's capability . Granted , even though this game was released somewhat early in the PS2 's era , I simply ca n't believe that a system that can play games like Resident Evil 4 and God of War I and II could put out something this hacked.Now , before I say anything let me just say that the G3 on this disc is NOT THE SUPER NINTENDO VERSION ! So if you are like me and wanted to play that game again , you can forget it . Dont pay any attention to all these ridiculous positice 5-star reviews on this site . I have no idea what kind of drugs these other gamers are on or they probably work for Konami directly.This is SUPPOSED to be a straight arcade port , but I ca n't imagine the arcade version looking and playing this terribly ... and I was right ! I went as far as to check Youtube videos of both the SNES and arcade versions and they BOTH look significantly better than this game . So judging from that , this game is n't even a straight arcade port of G3 ... so what version is this exactly ? ? ? I have no idea . Seems like some extremely poor rushed port of the arcade version that plays more like an emulated game with extremely pixaleted graphics that look as if they belong on the original NES . Things are just too uneven , the objects are too big and the ships and enemies have probably like 2 or 3 colors at most . Overall , it looks terrible . I was shocked because after the really cheap looking presentation I was afraid that my worst fear was true , that this was not the SNES version . For that game , it seems that Konami made it a point to overhaul the gameplay and graphics when bringing the original arcade version home to make it more `` home friendly '' , and they did an absolutely excellent job of doing so . G3 for the SNES game looked and played about 3X better than the original arcade version . I 'm not sure why Konami , being the same company that brought the SNES version knowing FULL WELL it was superior to the arcade , decided instead bring the more substandard arcade version to the PS2 instead of their SNES classic . Not to also mention that the PS2 has about 3 or 4 times the graphical horsepower that the SNES had ! It 's like , are you kidding me ? ? ? Again , it was a rush job and an absolute embarrassment to them . Shame on Konami for not having the common sense to AT THE VERY LEAST just port the SNES version over . If you ask me , this should 've been an overhauled and updated version of the SNES version ! Who even cares about the arcade version of G3 ? ? ? I wish I can say some redeeming things about the game , but if the game is n't even ARCADE perfect , what 's the point ? This is just an humiliating rush job that was just put out to meet demand . Even the voice acting prompts in the game that state what power up you use sound severely weak . Konami decided to forgo the cheesy sounding `` kill/destroy them all ! '' and `` You need more practice '' bits out of the SNES versions , and on here they just sound annoying and stupid and completely unfitting to the game 's atmosphere.Now considering Gradius 4 , there is n't much difference . The G4 version on this disc does look and play a BIT better than the G3 version . But from my memory G4 was n't brought home on any console , so we really only have the arcade version to go by . Whether this is an ACTUAL arcade port of the game I 'm not really sure because I did n't bother researching G4 on Youtube or anywhere else to make a comparison . Granted , even so , the game does move a BIT faster and gameplay is a bit smoother and there is n't that disgusting pixelated look to the game , but overall G4 is just a small step better than G3 . I feel no real desire to return to either game , and would much rather just buy a used copy of G3 for the SNES instead . To add insult to injury , the games do n't even have a continue feature with them . Nope , you basically have to beat these games in a single sitting with your measly 3 lives ( and 5 if you change it on the options menu ) , and considering how badly these games play , do n't even bother putting it on anything harder than `` Very Easy '' mode . You wo n't get anywhere.Save your money , and if you 're a Gradius fan , I would suggest either getting an NES to play the original , an SNES for G3 and for your PS2 go out and spend the extra for Gradius 5 which is a completely new version of Gradius that actually decides to USE the PS2 's graphical power . But avoid this rush job at all costs !	-1
what happens when you take a successful arcade game and translate it to a console ? success right ? WRONG- in this case that is . This game was great in the arcade due to the inovative use of a rifle and scope . But when you take that away all you have is a very bad & quot ; Area 51 & quot ; -esque game . This game should have never been translated to ANY console and you will notice this quickly after playing for a minute or two . The controls are sluggish and just like any other shooting game that does n't have a gun peripherial , it gets boring FAST . Only get this game if it is the only game you can find when you are buying a PS2 .	-1
This was one game that I remotely enjoyed in the arcade , but unfortunately what made the game worth its while was the gun . The gun was the whole attraction of the game , which was otherwise just a dull shoot-em-up.But my question is why ? Why repackage a game that was clearly marked for the Arcades with the extra guns and what-not . Yes , Playstation has had some success in repackaging some of the arcade games for play at home , and yes thay have made great games with shooter attributes without the gun , but if they were to re-package a shooter game where people have gotten used to using a gun in the arcade for Playstation-2 , they should ( and could ) have gave us some sort of a gun for just a few dollars extra and at least made it worth its while .	-1
This game ... . When I buy a game I want to be able to play it over and over . But with this game if you play it once you know all there is about it . The snipers are always in the same spot , doing the same thing for the same amount of time . If you like arcade games like this rent do n't buy this game it 's a waste of [ money ] .	-1
Silent Scope can not be played using a control pad . The `` scope '' moves so slowly , and it is rather frustrating to look for enemies while being shot sixty million times because it takes twelve years to move the gun scope around to find targets . A good PS2 zapper , if included , would make this game 4 or even 5 stars . The graphics are crisp and clear , the sound is good , but none of that matters when your game is over in ten seconds because you ca n't look around fast enough .	-1
This is the fourth installment in LucasArts ' `` Monkey Island '' series . Producers of the game have stated in on-line interviews that there would indeed be a fifth installment , but as of my writing it 's apparently not under production.I bought and played this one essentially on the strength of the third item in the series , `` Escape from Monkey Island , '' which I adjudge to be far better.They seemed to have a winning recipe in that installment : why did they completely overhaul the concept ? Well , okay , not everything was overhauled . The voice actors , atmosphere , and quirky sense of humor are all intact , but the game designers saw fit to completely revamp the way Guybrush moves around the screen . And whether you set his movement to `` character-relative '' or `` screen-relative , '' it never seems to work right.Nor do the gamemakers think anything of including a lot of puzzles that rely on a timer , so you 've got to manuever this difficult to control character around before a certain door closes , etc . I do n't think they had the right to do that , so to speak , while the character movement was so wonky.But the thing that really gets my goat is that they took the unique , beautiful cartoony look of Monkey Island 3 and replaced it with CGI drawn characters , which effectively robs this series of its central charm : superior visuals.The look of the islands , the sky , the clouds , and even the characters in Monkey 3 was so well-done and charming that I stuck with that game just to enjoy the game 's eye-candy . I thought it was the game 's greatest strength . And that 's precisely what they 've monkeyed with -- pardon the pun.In fact , with the stunning visuals gone , the character of the gameplay rises to the fore , and the idiocy and frustration of many of the puzzles becomes unbdeniably apparent.In fact , I got so frustrated with Monkey 4 that , after getting about halfway through the game , I just sat there with a walkthrough trying to get through the rest of it . Even with the walkthrough , though , it was still a slog ! The entire time I was cheating , I kept thinking , `` Sheesh . I 'm glad I did n't waste precious hours of my life agonizing over that puzzle . I would simply never have guessed the solution , since THE SOLUTION DOES N'T MAKE ANY FLIPPIN ' SENSE ! '' . . . which means if you 'd like to go through this game straight , you 've basically got to try to pick up every object , try every object you have on every other object in every possible screen.If you find this kind of thing fun , then knock yourself out .	-1
Bought it because it sounded really interesting . Never got it to run on my computer . Continuoslly locked up my system . Actually threw away the disc . Did n't feel it was worth wrecking my computer for .	-1
I just picked up Mafia -- more than 7 years after its release -- mostly because of the positive ratings ( more on this later ) . If you can get past the fact that the graphics are dated ( although remarkable considering the limitations they worked with ) and learn about the game in terms of gameplay alone , read on.First the basics : Mafia tells the story of Thomas Angelo as he joins the ranks of the Salieri 'famiglia ' and gains power within their ranks . The story -- which seems to be one of the selling points of the game -- is delivered through twenty multi-staged missions and in-engine cutscenes . The many interactive challenges in each mission are delivered through two distinct gameplay modes : driving and third-person exploration/combat.The third-person mode is the most versatile . From menial work to secret dealings to baseball bat beatings to all-out tommy-gun massacres , this is where the most action will come from . These segments can be pretty challenging : the AI does n't waste its chances . If you CAN get shot , you WILL get shot ; you , in the other hand , will leave lots of bullets in door thresholds as the game misrepresents your line of sight . It 's probably too preoccupied with cooking threats -- be it a couple of shotgun-toting goons out of nowhere or a well-placed shooter -- to bother with those pesky details , such as saving your progress . You 'll find yourself going back to square one quite time a few times as the game just decides that it 's not handing you any more ammo or health refills , and tough luck , here comes yet another trigger-happy batch , freshly teleported from Screwjoo.Every failure ( and there will plenty of them ) will set you back from twenty minutes to an hour of 'gameplay ' , and it wo n't spare you any of the mind-numbing chores that saturate the 'experience ' . You will have to go drive all the way there again , talk to guy A and guy B again , search for and fetch C for them ( most of the time without knowing precisely what you 're looking for or where to begin ) , and even load boxes into trucks and wipe out puke from a backed out toilet ... and it 's just as fun as it sounds.Not all of the game is made of tight spots and grunt work , though . You will be doing plenty of driving too : some missions involve vintage car chases ( which at 30 mph somehow fail to be the adrenaline pumpers you 'd expect ) , and the miniature city of Lost Haven is big and labyrinthine enough that most of your time will be spent traveling between points A and B . Going any significant distance in these roads ( which apparently were designed by M.C . Escher ) means a lot going around blocks and finding the entrance points of bridges and tunnels . You can try to cut corners , but policemen and cop cars will show up when least expected to punish you for running that red light or speeding . Lastly , there 's also a little circuit racing ; here , your main task will be not to engineer those sharp turns in a way that will keep you car from spinning like a top , which is harder than it sounds as the car seems to like it.That about sums it up . Oh , I forget : Mafia has been compared to the GTA titles , but in truth the resemblance is very superficial . It should be likened to the Sims -- Sure , you can roam about and steal another car and victimize random citizens , but it does n't reward wanton violence the way GTA did . No powerups , no better guns or cars , no cool stuff to be stolen ... fuggedaboutit.Veredict : Avoid like the plague . Unless you 're a masochist.What should have been a three-hour game was padded into a much larger but radically duller and more frustrating experience . What little genuine fun remained was irrecoverably marred by obtuse , artificial difficulty ( stiff controls , the savepoint system ) and brain-dead chores.Whether the team ran out of ideas five seconds after development began or they just hate gamers , I do n't know . I theorize that the positive reviews given to this game either a ) come from a time where much less was expected from games and b ) nobody dares tell the emperor that he 's naked . Look elsewhere for a genuine vintage thrill ; I 've heard Max Payne also comes pretty cheap these days .	-1
I really hate to say that this game is thoroughly mediocre since it does have a few things going for it , such as the gorgeous graphics and somewhat interesting storyline . However , I can not recommend Mafia to anyone who has already played a truly great driving/gangster game such as Grand Theft Auto 3 , or who does n't like attempting a single mission 30+ times . Overall , the idea of letting you play a Mafia don in the 1930s is a good one ; however , it 's just poorly implemented in this game.Gameplay : Your character is a taxi driver who is forced into a career of crime . By completing missions ( driving , killings , vandalism , more driving , etc . ) , you rise in the ranks of the Salieri crime family . Much of the gameplay , from the controls ( mouse , keyboard , and optionally a gamepad ) to mission design , is easy to pick up and much like GTA3 . Nonetheless , the big problem with Mafia is that the gameplay is tedious and at some points down right boring . While the city you do your dirt in is very beautifully rendered , it 's rather dead and does not have the bustle and liveliness of GTA3 's Liberty City or Vice City . There 's no reason to ever get out of your car as you are driving between missions , since there are no ammo shops to visit , mini-missions to unlock , or other things to do . You can literally spend 20 minutes driving from Salieri 's bar to the next mission site , and there is absolutely no feeling of accomplishment once you finally arrive.On the good side , the developers of the game have tried to make it realistic , which is both the strength but also many of the weaknesses of the game . The cars look fantastic , though they handle poorly . Also , unlike GTA3 , you ca n't commit outrageous traffic violations without drawing the police , and you ca n't just jump in and steal any parked car . The animation of the character models look realistic and scenary feels authentic . Also , though it has the automatic save system that GTA3 has , Mafia saves the game at more points , so that you do n't have to do too much backtracking if ( I mean when ) you fail a mission.Now , for the bad side . The cars are just a chore to drive . Bad handling , low horsepower , slippery tires , you name it . And given that there is so much driving required by the game , the developers should have allowed you to skip some of the non-eventful driving scenes . To make matters worse , many of the missions are timed and the in-game map is useless . You 'll lose a number of missions just searching for the bridges that connect the city together ( no roads or bridges appear on the in-game map ) . It is hard to imagine why the developers of this game thought that beginning and ending missions with such annoyingly long and tedious driving sequences would be fun to players.And now , for the ugly . Yes , the racing mission ( # 6 ) is as awful as many people have said . Even though I have the patched version of the game that includes a difficulty slider for the race , it was still too hard on the `` very easy '' setting . The race is way too long , the track has way too many sharp turns , the race car is way to prone to spin-outs and roll-overs , and the controls ( gamepad or keyboard ) just do n't cut it for what is required . I tried this mission over 30 times and never won the race and thus never finished the game ( which is rare for me ) . The race was the worst instance of the frustrations of gameplay , but there were plenty more.Graphics : The real shame is that Mafia , as tedious and poorly designed as it is , is a beautiful game . The cutscenes , though a bit too long sometimes , are well done and even the lip-syncing is better than most games I 've played . The cars are shiny and sleek and show damage when they are abused . The city itself is well rendered and driving in the countryside is just heavenly . It 's just too bad that some of the energy that was expended on creating such realistic graphics was not used to make a truly exciting game.Sound : Everything is cool in this department . The voice acting is well done ; cars , weapons , and other things sound as they should ; and the music is fine.Replay/value : Since I only paid $ 10 for this game , it 's hard to feel cheated , even though I was able to complete only 5 of the 20 missions . My disappointment is largely about what this game could have been with just a bit more effort and testing . If you are a very patient player and do n't mind long stretches of repetitive gameplay ( such as all of the dull driving that you 'll be doing ) and can find a way to beat the racing mission , then this might be worth your while . However , if you are expecting a game with a lot of exciting car action , very original missions , and anything approaching GTA3 's funny , openended mayhem , definitely look elsewhere .	-1
A note to game developers everywhere . It 's possible to create a challenging game that does not involve intensely annoying obstacles . Rule # 1 : all games should have a quick save option at any point in the game . No one enjoys going over the same mission over and over to get it right . Mafia only saves at the end of a mission or important task -- or not nearly enough ! This alone makes me want to pitch the whole mess . Rule # 2 : excessive amounts of driving around and map reading with old jalopy cars with extremely poor handling and dealing with other stupid drivers on the road is no fun attall ! Way too much driving required . I drive enough to and from work 5x a week and deal with inconsiderate idiots on the road daily . I do n't need it in a game I want to be a diversion from the grind of daily life.If there were workable cheats available for this game it might be bearable . I would like to finish it , but only with access to cheats that actually work . I play games for enjoyment , not torture . I 've searched the internet several times for cheats , and none of them work as described . A real disappointing game that did n't have to be .	-1
Do n't get me wrong . This game is fun , however , the frustration factor is about to make me go on my own killing spree . First of all , there 's no in-game save . The game saves after every level so if you screw up you have to start over and over and over and over ... The vehicles are fun to drive , however , the control is difficult . I seem to slide on invisible patches of ice . Why is it that when I 'm chasing someone , no matter how fast my vehicle is , they get away ? and why is it that when I 'm being pursued , no matter how fast my vehicle is , they 're always riding my tail ? I found the race to be most challenging and you 'll use a few colorful words before you win . I would have won sooner , but again , al I did was skid at after turn and spin out to end up facing the wrong direction . The story-line is entertaining but the game is just too frustrating for me to just sit here and play the same level over and over and over and over . Two hours of the same level is not worth my time . I have a life .	-1
I was thoroughly disappointed in Mafia . I hate to say this , because I really wanted to like this game , and for the first hour or so I really did . But as the game progressed so did my frustration.It 's true that Mafia has it all - wonderful graphics , engaging story , interesting missions , action , even music . But there are a few pitfalls that turn it from a great game into a so-so game.First , even though I did not really mind all the driving , most of it bears absolutely no purpose . The racing mission was absurd . If I wanted to race sports cars I would 've bought a racing game . C'mon , people , NOBODY liked that mission ! What was the point of it ? But I stuck with it , forgiving them for the obviously annoying and pointless part , yet it never really got better . If anything , it got worse.While I can see they 've tried to make many aspects of the game ultra-realistic , it 's really anything but . Here are some points about that : Point 1 : I understand that the vigilant cops and traffic violations were put into the game to make it seem more realistic . But how come that running people over or bumping into other cars leaves the cops indifferent ? Point 2 : The police cars are the fastest cars in the game . No matter what car you 're driving , even a race car , they WILL catch up to you and arrest you . Yet when later in the game you get to drive a police car , the other police cars are STILL faster than you . Makes any sense ? To me neither.Point 3 . The game is happening in the 1930s . How in the world would a cop measure your speed ? How could a cop walking on the sidewalk know what the speed of your car is ? Yet they all stop you , cops in cars AND cops on the sidewalk.Point 4 . The cops only seem to be after YOU . Whenever you have to chase after someone in your car , of course you have to speed if you want to catch up with them . Yet if you do the cops will run you off the road and arrest you for speeding . Never the other guy . Same goes for the `` hide weapon '' feature . If the cops spot you carrying a gun they will arrest you , yet there is one mission where you start with the gun in your hand . The sequence loads , you do n't even have a chance to hide your weapon , and immediately the cops spot you . Forget trying to get away . The only way to finish either mission is to pray there are no cops around when the mission starts.Point 5 : If you reload while your gun still has bullets in it , you lose those bullets . Only a fool would discard their half-used magazine in real life . In fact , in the military they encourage you to reload as often as possible , because this way there 's less chance to run into an empty magazine.Another thing that might not be a problem for other games but is a huge one for Mafia is that it 's a very linear game . It gives you very little room for creativity . In one of the first missions you have to collect money from a gas station and then carchase and kill the guy that stole the money . Before going into the gas station I shot the tires on the car , just in case . But when the very nest sequence loaded the car was driving just fine . The game consistently points you in the right direction , and there are no rewards for exploring on your own or deviating from the main plotline ( unlike in games like Morrowind , in which you can progress any which way you want ) .And of course , the most frustrating aspect of the game is your inability to save games . Honestly , I ca n't comprehend why game developers do that . Is it so difficult to put in a savegame feature ? Mafia is not simply a game where you can not save , it 's an _extremely difficult_ game where you ca n't save . Who wants to spend two hours going through the same mission over and over again ? Did I mention that the conversations written into the missions repeat as well , and that you can not skip them ? After spending 2,5 hours on one of such missions only to get killed in the last two minutes of it and have to start all over again , I finally gave up . Sure I want a game that 's challenge ( I play all my games on `` hard '' or `` realistic '' difficulty setting ) , but I do n't want a game that 's a total frustration roller-coaster.Mafia could have been a real gem . It could have easily been an epic classic of the gaming world if it was n't for the aforementioned downsides .	-1
Pretty much everything has already been said and I think it just depends on the person , but I got bored with this game ... so bored that when I upgraded my system and the game stopped working with the new configuration , I did n't really care even though I was only a fourth of the way finished.So , if I have anything to say about this , I 'll speak to that problem.Without getting into specifics , basically when I upgraded my system from mid-level to high-end , the game stopped working . It will load and begin , but then it just completely quit . I lowered the clock speed on my processor and selected the lowest graphics settings : that got the game to work for about 30 minutes before it just crashed again . That was also after I installed the patch . None of this makes any sense to me and I fix and build computers for a living.At that point , I was only playing because I 'd spent good money on this game and was hoping there was going to be something other than pretty graphics and a good story to make it worth while . It takes up too much space on the hard drive ( IMHO ) and the game play is seriously lacking . There 's no incentive to explore-it 's entirely too linear.Perhaps if I had a chance to really get into the Free Ride part I 'd like it , but since you have to play the regular part of the game before all of the Free Ride is unlocked ... and since the bloody game wo n't hardly work anymore ( even though all of my soft and hardware is ` supported ' ) I guess I will never know.I 'm not at the point of asking for my money back , but close . I 'm very disappointed and I really wanted to like this game . I tried to like it . I like driving games and I like mafia and old ` Chicago ' type of stories . I did not like this game , though ... even when it was working.Download the demo before you buy . If you do buy , download the patch because you 'll be glad you did when you get to the race . It 's absurdly difficult without intermediate saves .	-1
This game wo n't install on my new AMD 3500+ cpu , it freezes during disc 2 . Purchase with extreme caution .	-1
I 've got a brand new Nvidia 5200 128 MB graphics card , and just got back into computer gaming , so I was eager to try this game because it 's a genre I love . Plus , my PC played COD and Battlefield 1942 so there should n't have been technical problems to play it . Boy was I wrong to think that.This game is a technical disaster . I ran it on a P4 with 256 MB RAM and it still crashed on me three times , something that never happened even once with other games at all.After it crashed for the third time BEFORE I even got to start the first mission , I gave up.The developers really dropped the ball on this game . From its looks and screen shots I 've seen , it looks like a great game . But if it 's too unstable to play , nobody 's going to notice it.This game is an absolute disaster from a technical standpoint and the developers should be ashamed of themselves .	-1
just like my title states i may never even get to play this one , way to many controls for this budget shooter horribly set up its quite boring so far and i may never go back to it dont pay more than 3-4 bucks and do n't buy it unless you are extremly patient	-1
After playing & quot ; The Longest Journey & quot ; ( sigh-I loved it ) I was getting edgy for something new . I wanted to see if there were any games out there like it . & quot ; The Longest Journey & quot ; is still my favorite game and I wanted something similar or better ( if possible ) . I read all the reviews of THIS game . Half of the reviews seemed favorable and the other half hated it . What to do ... I contacted , via email some of the reviewers to ask them if they think I would like the game . Consensus showed I should get it . Okay so here goes ... ..The game began with little graphic and exciting scenes of what to expect and then BOOM ! The actual game had horrible graphics . I mean real bad . It 's so pixilated you can barely make out the Sphinx itself . I proceeded anyway because I was kind of feeling the Indiana Jones hype and went further..to the first and obvious puzzle . It seemed hard at first but I & quot ; unlocked & quot ; the puzzle in 5 minutes ! That 's right ! 5 minutes . Okay , I gave it one more chance ... I tried to find my way to the next step and the 180 degree turns and slow & quot ; Myst & quot ; click and move steps got me so annoyed and lost it took me an hour just to figure out where I needed to go . I could never get to the spot I needed to , because apparently I needed to download a patch to proceed . I found out after calling some game stores at the local mall that you need a few of these patches to improve the game . It is playable without them , but extraordinarily difficult . I really wanted this game to succeed . I had done my homework , giving it a fair chance and it failed . It really was like an Egyptian & quot ; Myst & quot ; minus the beautiful graphics , intellectually challenging puzzles and lacking a great plot . I am still remaining open to new ideas from anybody . I have since , returned & quot ; The Riddle of the Sphinx & quot ; and am looking forward to suggestions from other game reviewers . If anybody has ideas for me please feel free to email . Thank You . And to those of you who were so kind and helpful ... I 'm truly glad you liked the game..I guess it just was n't for me .	-1
First , there are similar games with better grahpics , like Myst . Second , upon playing the game I felt a bit betrayed . Nothing on the packaging indicates that this game has a specifically Christian outlook , but it becomes apparent upon play . Had I know , I would n't have bought it in the first place . Now that I have I suppose I 'll have to sell it in an attemp to recoup something . The designers , et al , should have had the integrity to be honest about the slant of the game BEFORE unsuspecting people buy it and discover it for themselves . I 've nothing against proselytization , but at least be up front about it so that I do n't waste my time or money .	-1
I bought this & # 34 ; Brand new & # 34 ; and the yellow cable had black smudge marks all over it . The pin connector that plugs into the ps2 was damaged and loose . I had with it red white yellow AND an S video cable instead of red white and s video . I tried everything possible to get it to work and nothing , no picture showed up or sound when turned to the right channel mode and the cables matching where it should go . The black cable also has a small cut in the black cable but it did n't go all the way through . I will be returning this once i get paid and buying something else . I heard ps3 s video cables work with the ps2 and it is a sony product so I will try that .	-1
The s-video connector is faulty . It only works as a composite cable . I wish I had tried it sooner as I would have returned it .	-1
This cable hardly has any improvement over the Sony cable that comes with the PSX and the PS2 . If not demagnatized it creates crazy interferance and sends things that look like vertical damper wires all over the screen . You 're much better off with a Sony S-Video cable , a Monster Gamelink S-Video cable , or Interact 's higher quality cable . I personally suggest Interacts better one because it offers better quality at a lower cost than Monsters . The cables themselves are thin and badly shielded , thus the audio performance is also sub par . The only advantage is the ability to un-join the cables , so you can send the audio to your stereo , and the video to your TV . But you can do that with Interacts better cable , you ca n't with monster 's .	-1
I feel I should post how much I hated this piece of junk here , since the other reviews seem to give the impression that it 's a fantastic game and everybody will love it . I could n't stand it and took it back a couple of days later . All the positive reviews below positively puzzle me , since engaged in a conversation about this game in the local EB , everybody else declared they had hated it too . So who 's writing those reviews ? The thing is too slow ! It takes about 50 years to build a school . And the economics of the game do n't make sense either -- you charge nothing for rent and pay everybody beaucoup bucks , and still everybody moves off your island and the birth rate decreases.Also , this game is not as funny as the programmers obviously believe . I agree with the reviewer below who said that the manual is much funnier than the actual game.Lastly , the graphics of the game are overcomplex , meaning that the game will be extremely fussy on most setups . This would n't be such a problem , but Tropico either has no tech support line , or they do n't answer what they say is the support line , or they 've done a fantastic job with hiding the contact information of the real tech support line . In other words , after a couple of days of trying , I could n't get any help .	-1
This game is ridiculous- I could n't even finsish it . In fact , I barely started it . It 's obviously just a ripoff of all the Blair Witch hype from a few years ago- a movie I love . Disappointing .	-1
As a fan of the movie , I had high hopes for this game , but they did n't pan out . Not quite a true port - `` Rustin Parr '' is more of a cross-over between the BWP franchise and `` Nocturne '' .In the game , you play Elspeth `` Doc '' Holliday , a sort of gun-wielding investigator for a super-secret government organization of the 1940 's - one introduced in `` Nocturne '' . With its own simulator room , the agency trains agents like Holliday to take on missions involving the supernatural ( what we now call `` paranormal '' ) phenomenon . Inevitably , Holliday 's superiors have become drawn to the case of `` Rustin Parr '' , a recluse who killed a group of children near his hometown of Burkittsville ( formerly `` Blair '' ) , Maryland in a psychotic rage in 1941 . Parr vaguely attributed his crimes to prodding by the legendary Elly Kedward ( aka `` The Blair Witch '' ) . ( Parr 's story was told in the movie , and it 's apparently his creepy house in which the final , cryptic scenes of the film play out . ) The premise of the game sort of clashes with the original 's movie 's selling point - which was to keep us wondering about whether these supernatural elements were genuine no atter how obvious it was they were.I got ta confess that I could n't get past the start-up level . The game ran smoothly , as far as hardware is concerned , on my old Pentium 4 ( at this stage , hardware specs are your least worry ) , but gameplay itself was a major hassle . Using the `` Nocturne '' game engine , you maneuver Holliday in 3rd person . Only , unlike other `` shooters '' - 3rd or 1st person , game perspective is n't fixed to the character , but to a room - set pieces through which your character enters & exits . This allows for nice looking scenes ( since your PC does n't have re-render the backgrounds to compensate for movement ) but extremely static ones . It also makes it harder to confront threats and position yourself for such esoteric acts as opening doors or picking up objects . This made for extremely frustrating gameplay from the very first level . I got fed up just trying to navigate the simulator room , and decided to make the game vanish from my HD . Recently , I thought I 'd give the game a second chance , yet all I 've found is the CD sleeve ...	-1
Everyone likes saving money , and this controller is cheaper by far , but it 's not worth it . Aside from the occasionally working buttons and tricky directional-pad , the worst crime comes from the rumble feature . If you 're playing a game that uses the rumble feature a lot , you 're going to discover that [ inferior ] plastic shaking in your hands not only feels wrong , but it sounds wrong , too . I had people from way across the room comment on the loud noises coming from the vibrations of this plastic wonder . Do yourself a favor and just buy the real thing instead of this one .	-1
WHEN U BUY THIS CONTROLLER YOU ONLY BUY IT TO SAVE 5 BUCKS . YOU WONT SAVE 5 BUCKS WHEN YOU HAVE TO SPEND 120 BUCKS TO FIX UR PS2 . ALSO , IT VOIDS UR WARRENTY . TO ME , IT DIDNT RUIN MY PS2 COMPLETELY , IT JUST BURNED OUT THE CONTROLLER PORT . SO I USE THE SECOND CONTROLLER PORT WITH A MULTI TAP ( WHICH DOESNT ALWAYS WORK ) I FINALYL DECIDED TO SEND THE PS2 FOR FIXING . AND IT WAS MUCH CHEAPER THAN 120 BUCKS CAUSE IT WAS ONLY A CONTROLLER PORT.SO PRETTY MUCH , INSTEAD OF SAVING 5 BUCKS WHICH U CAN MAKE IN AN HOUR WORKING FOR BURGER KING , I SPEND LOTS MORE FIXING THE PS2	-1
Wow , let me count the ways this controller [ stinks ] .Let 's start with the fact that this waste of $ $ $ will VOID YOUR PS2 WARRANTY ! ! ! Yep , I found out the hard way . Any ( ANY ! ) third-party accessory you buy that is not licensed by SONY will INSTANTLY VOID YOUR PS2 WARRANTY . One month after purchasing my PS2 ( which was also the time period for the return policy at the store I bought the PS2 from ) I made the mistake of picking up one of these horrid controllers ( it lasted two weeks before finally dying - that is , when I could play games ) . Games started locking up left and right after I started using it . According to SONY tech support , the second I plugged in this uncomfortable hunk of poo , my PS2 warranty went flying out the window . So I sent the PS2 back to SONY for repair ( along with this controller for testing ) at the price of $ 119 and a month without the machine ( it 's hard to watch your new DVD 's when your brand new DVD player is already being repaired ) . The PS2 came back repaired along with a new warranty and a letter from SONY stating this controller was the cause of the problem as determined by diagnostic testing . SHWEEEEEEEEEET ! ! ! I understand that this will not happen to every PS2 combined with this controller , BUT you WILL lose your warranty none the less . I have run across this issue on several PS2 message boards and the SONY tech support person I initially spoke with said many other PS2 owners have had this problem thanks to the Dual Impact Gamepad . Please , learn from my mistake and spend the extra cabbage on a good controller . Or not , it 's your $ $ $ .	-1
Extremely cheap AV cord here . It worked to replace our totally broken cord , but it got damaged quickly . One of the sides of the part you insert into the Playstation cracked and bent , making the device very loose in the console . The other side quickly followed , and soon after , the sides of the plastic insert just broke off . This caused the device to fall out when the console was moved even a little . It also resulted in only one speaker side working because the device no longer fit into the console and it messed up the sound . We ended up having to prop up the device by inserting a video game case under it .	-1
Well , it was cheap . The cables are super thin . Think cheap headphone cable . The sound cables worked fine , but the video output has continual static snow that drives over the screen in waves . Other than that it works .	-1
I tried this stick out to compliment my old Namco arcade stick . They shou'dve spent less time with the metal , and put more of the money into developing responsive buttons and a stick that registers motion correctly . None of the extra features matter if the basic design is flawed so deeply . A controller 's first and really , only purpose is to enable you to move your character around smoothly onscreen . The Shadowblade fails at this . I 've used Ascii sticks , Hori sticks , Mas sticks , and the Shadowblade is n't even close though it shares a similar price range.Shop around . There are way better sticks out there . Especially if you 're a fighting game fan , you 're just torturing yourself if you buy this mess .	-1
On a whim and a touch of desperation I picked this up at a local shop , being the only stick I could find in town . I really regret doing so because it 's just awful . & quot ; Mush & quot ; describes it well , mushy buttons , mushy stick , just mushy . This is due to the fact that everything on the stick is capable of operating in analog mode ( why ? this is an arcade stick for crying out loud ! ) . Because of this , response time is greatly reduced in fighters and you 've got to really throw the stick through its entire range before it will register.If you 've ever used a nice stick like the ASCII FT ( even the Agetech DC stick ) or any of Happ 's sticks in an arcade for any length of time , avoid this thing like the plague . You 'll regret it as much as I do .	-1
this product is horrable for arcades i got this for Metal slug sucks it evan sucks on fighters i was like omg dont get this its waste of money and time	-1
My intention with this review is to provide a rather different oppinion from most reviews here which qualify this game with an average 4.5 stars . I purchased this game for my son for two reasons : The price drop and the excellente reviews . I had no previous knowledge of Rayman , so I came unbiased to play it . I own 3 titles from Spyro the Dragon ( games that have always satisfied my son ) Jak and Daxter ( PS2 ) and Crash Bandicoot `` Wrath of Cortex '' ( Xbox ) , and my son plays all of them very regularly . I personally like these games very much so I expected Rayman 2 to be a great platformer game . Well , the thing is that my son played Rayman 2 for about an hour and a half and never picked it up again , I myself had to play it in order to understand what was wrong , but then I understood him.First : the graphics , I have read in every review , even the newer ones , that the graphics are excellent and so on . Well , to my opinion the graphics can not even match Spyro 3 on the PSOne , they are graphics that are ok for an early launch on the PS2 but can not be compared to the possibilities that we are getting today , and I refer in this case to Jak and Daxter , where the developers ( Naughty Dog ) have done a beautiful job on this subject . Second : the voice acting , what can I say , I personally found the constant whispering ( instead of real voices ) very annoying , I even thought there was some kind of malfunction in the CD because of this , until I realized that those whispers WERE the voices . Third : the story , even though it is a typical platform story , there is no fun in it , I personally found it very boring , and I could n't play it for more than half hour before I could fall asleep.I truly wish that I could find something good about this game , but the truth is that I had to sell it one day after I got it , neither my son nor I liked this game . If you truly want to play a good platformer then go for Jak and Daxter , there is no comparison ( great graphics , hilarious voice acting -even in spanish- , good story and lots of fun ) , or wait for the PS2 version of Spyro the dragon , or even play the PSOne versions of Spyro , I can assure you that you will have more fun with those than you will with Rayman 2 . I was deceived by the price drop and the good reviews , and made a terrible mistake : wasted [ money ] , so do n't fall for the same , this game can only and hardly diserve the one star I gave it .	-1
I rented the game and had high expectations ... but this is what I got ... .The game has an excellent story line ... too bad they ruined it by getting off the point , non clear directions , and well whoever made this game needs help concentrating ! well the graphics are OK ... .not anything good , but bearable although a few times I could n't tell land from water and died . then there is the camera ( viewing ) is way too weird ! I mean half the time I could n't see where I was going ! but the worst part of this game was the errors ! ... this happened several other places also ! and if you did n't save your game you lose everything ! one other thing was some of the rides like the rollercoaster ( if you call it that ) will make you sick to your stomach ... on the rollercoaster all you are doing is spinning very very fast . and they set it up so it appears on the screen that you are sitting on the seat ... still get headaches from just the thought of it . if you want to try the game be sure to rent it first ! ! ! and make sure you get pretty far in the game ( past the first mask ) because that is where the trouble starts .	-1
Beware everyone this game is extremely addicting at one point in my life it was taking up almost all of my leisure time . I would have gave it one star because of its extreme ability to make people lose their lives over this game but its such a fun game I had to give it 2 .	-1
Black and White is an incredible game . I was completely blown away . The game is based on brilliant and wonderfully executed ideas . It is a rich and engaging game with many different levels of play . The gameplay is so varied , I sometimes feel like I 'm playing five games in one.It 's addictive , it 's fun , it looks nice , it has a great interface , wonderful sound , and I 'm pretty sure people will be talking about this game for years to come.BUT ... It is also perhaps the most buggy piece of software I 've ever personally encountered . Several features that were supposed to be in the game at release are not even there at all . The game crashes constantly . A lot of things simply do n't work right . Many little issues with gameplay balance combined with countless bugs stack up to one big problem : a barely-playable game.I wish I 'd returned it to the store at which I bought it before my thirty days were up . Fans have been waiting for a patch for two months . And just learned they have another few weeks to wait on that patch . The game is absolutely not a final version ; it 's a beta . Do n't pay forty dollars for a beta ( really , everyone who has bought the game so far should be compensated for finding the bugs ) .My advice : Get this game , once the patch comes out ... and once you 've heard about whether or not the patch works .	-1
After reading all of the previews and ad information for this game , I was convinced that it really was going to be a unique gaming experience . Black & amp ; White is unique , uniquely frustrating , uniquely cumbersome , and uniquely over-hyped.I want to start by pointing out that if you have read the previews and even reviews for this game , you are being misled . The professional reviewers of this game base most of their opinions on the & quot ; stunning graphics & quot ; ( that can burden even the best video cards ) and the interesting God-game storyline . The graphics , while well made , are nothing unexpected , and at the close in zooms show quite a bit of blockiness for such a supposedly & quot ; revolutionary & quot ; game engine . As for the God-game storyline , this game differs little from your standard RTS ( real-time strategy ) game . Resource management , and a semblance of a & quot ; tech-tree & quot ; , in the form of captured village centers that offer different miracles , lead you down the same path as any other game in the genre . Adding in the Creature makes the game a micro-management nightmare . The creature starts off dumb and greedy , and grows smart and aggressive even when you actively discourage that behavior.The interface is an exercise in frustration . Attempting to navigate the map is like trying to drive a car with one steering wheel for each tire . Turning can lead to being stuck on the sides of mountains until you change your zoom to get around it . Moving through confined areas , like the mountain passes in the first map , can take a significant amount of time , zooming , turning , and tilting . All this adds together to completely prohibit quick movement on the map , a major problem for any RTS game.The job of managing your villagers , in their various villages , means that you will spend the majority of your time tending to these lazy people . Instead of just providing their resources , you must begin construction on ALL of their structures . The will whine about everything , and do nothing to fulfill their own needs . This means that you will spend most of your time watering fields that your farmer disciples do nothing with . Making forester disciples means nothing unless the trees are right in front of these idiots . In fact , the only disciples , of the eight that you can create , that do their jobs well are the breeder and missionaries . In the end , you will have to do most things yourself and leave your followers to sit on their blocky behinds.One last note , if you are really intent on buying this game , my recommendation is to get every help guide and walk through you can find . The manual provided is practically useless , and the in game help is more comic relief than help . Your best bet is to wait for this game to end up in the bargain basket , and at least save yourself some money .	-1
I 've had this game for a few months now . At first I loved it . Learning about each individual element of the game ( e.g. , the miracles , the creature , the villagers , the islands , the opposing gods ) was fun and promised for exciting gameplay . Unfortunately , knitting all of the elements together into a comprehensive whole is one area where Black & amp ; White needs work . For instance , in order to accomplish anything , you are forced to & quot ; increase your influence & quot ; -- that is , you can not interact directly with any area of the island that is not under your influence . To gain influence , you have to demonstrate to the neighboring villagers that you are a powerful god by tossing rocks , trees , people , fireballs , whatever over their heads so they fear and/or are amazed by you . This becomes very tedious . It takes ages to gain the influence you need and the process to gain it is not very fun.Alas , I wanted so much to love this game , but it 's just too repetitive and slow .	-1
This game really is n't fun . I 'm not really sure what is supposed to BE fun about it . You ca n't skip through the cut scenes and the characters that play your concience are just annoying . Even with the trick to make immense amounts of food and wood with miracles you spend all your time trying to make the ant like people do SOMETHING . I spent about thirty or forty hours trying to enjoy this game and then I gave up . I had spent a rediculous amount of time trying to get through only a few parts of the game . Your creature really is n't very interesting . Sure it learns and everything but even teaching it is just a matter of repeating the same thing over and over and over and over again . Not something I really enjoy in a game but hey that 's just me . A few & quot ; levels & quot ; into the game your creature is taken from you and you have to be a god without him for a while . Right when I was getting a close to getting him back , I was set back another several hours by an attack I could have stopped had the symbol interface not been so slow . I 'm not sure who would enjoy this game for any amount of time . If you like being in control I 'd suggest a Sim game . Another thing I found odd was that this game came on a single CD . For it 's price and the amount of hype that I had heard I would have expected a game which consisted of a little more than poorly rendered worlds in which tasks are set up that are much more like chores than quests.In closing , if you like taking out the garbage and doing other menial tasks , there is a slim chance you could enjoy this game .	-1
Black and white is a very appropriate name for this game . Some parts are really good , then they become repetitive and boring , and you soon realize that you just wasted your time . I usually do n't rate games low , so when I do it says something about the game . I am almost mad at gamespot and other review sites , for once , for giving a game -- that did n't deserve it -- such a high score . If you want to get a couple hours of fun out of a game then go ahead and buy this , but I would advise you save your money and go buy a better game.The gameplay for this game is fun for around 4 hours , then you get to the 3rd level -- oh and just so you know there are only 5 'levels ' in the entire game -- the game breaks down . They take away your pet , who may I say is pretty stupid and just copies what you are doing , albeit in a very inconsistent manner and half the time just ends up doing more harm than good . Once your pet is taken away and you start with such a small village it is pitiful , you then come to realize how much time of your life you just wasted . The villagers in this game are mindless , they ca n't even make babies without you telling them to and when you do they always over breed . Also it is almost impossible to be a good god in this game , my people would always keep dying and they were too stupid to even farm right . The list of annoyances goes on , this is a lame attempt at being an RTS and it ends up falling flat on its face.The graphics , for the time , were good , though the people in the game did look slightly odd . Also , I do n't know if it was my computer or the game , when you zoom into things , like mountains , they start to mold and change shape as you get closer , a very ugly effect that I never got used to . Other than that most of the spells worked fine and looked pretty good ; though nothing was spectacular , it was solid nonetheless.The sound in this game is okay , though the first time one of your villagers die and you hear the `` deeeaaatthhh '' voice , it will take you a while to figure out what it is trying to tell you or whether it is another god speaking ( which would make it much more creepy ) . The sounds for the people are really annoying and I would rather have text than hear them talk , wait till you hear ( or do n't hear ) the fake Irish accents , they are a pain as is the rest of the voice-over . Other than that the sound is solid , with the different spells having nice sounds to them , from the rain to the fireball , that help differentiate one from the other.Overall this game will not give you any lasting value , unless you find this sort of cheap imitation of the RTS formula -- with a tacked on pet simulator -- enjoyable , then you might have some fun . Lionhead is a company that promises and does n't deliver ; I hope in their next outings that they learn to make a great game , then praise it .	-1
I was all for this game . I was convinced that BLACK and WHITE was not going to be the next DAIKATANA . No , I did n't want to believe that . But it is true . BLACK and WHITE is an over-hyped game . It was in development for about three years and gaming magazines and such labeled this game as something revolutionary . Well , BLACK and WHITE may be that , but did EA have to make it so boring ? The chance to play god should have been fun . In fact the opening moments of the game are the best . My two stars goes to the absolutley fantastic opening sequence of stunning visuals and graphics . And the music that plays really pumps me up for what I thought would be a special game . Alas , this was not to be . After , I choose my creature , the game really slows down the point of bordom . You make choices in the form of & quot ; Silver Scrolls & quot ; . These are quests that happen on the little island your on . This is where the game lost me.As for the controls , I think the folks at EA made them a little to complicated than it needed to be . This to me was the most frustrating part of the whole BLACK and WHITE experiance . If you ca n't have good control using the mouse with a game , then in my opinion , that game just can not be fun.Yes , this game is original , but I think some people will be bored . If you want to play god , I think THE SIMS is a far superior game , not to mention fun .	-1
The reviewers who went nuts over this game at the popular magazines and web sites probably felt the same way I did after completing the first of the game 's & quot ; worlds & quot ; .After the & quot ; tutorial & quot ; world where you are walked through the game 's premise , story , and how to get things done , I was having a lot of fun and was very excited about the game.Then it all went down the tubes.The supposed Creature AI is non-existent . It has nothing to do with artifical intelligence , it is merely an if/then database that plays percentages . It is frustrating and not complex . The AI wo n't link consequences to actions so you punish or reward actions regardless of their consequences.The game is very unhelpful . Since you have to spend a lot of time away from your creature doing quests , monitoring villagers , or scouting around , it would be nice if the game 's messages meany anything . However , when the message & quot ; Your creature will now do that sort of thing more often & quot ; comes up , it make syou want to scream . What did the creature do ? Was it good or bad ? Is it too late to reward/punish and teach the creature ( and of course it is ) ? Who the heck knows ? The game does n't tell you.When you do get around to rewarding and punishing your creature , you really have no idea if you & quot ; got to him in time & quot ; or if he is ridiculously associating your reward with another action.Creature Combat is ridiculously lame . It 's a glorified mouse clicking battle that does n't really mean anything.Finally , let 's say you 've played a while , feel like you 've gotten the hang of it , and want to start over ... too bad , there 's no such thing as starting over . First off , you have to go through the tutorial , no skipping , no fast forwarding ... so there goes a good hour of your time . It does n't really matter if you save or load your game , your & quot ; creature 's personality & quot ; is persistent . Basically , they were far too lazy to work in a real save/load , so instead they just hardwire your & quot ; creature & quot ; in , even if you & quot ; get a new creature & quot ; .Yes , the community has developed fan made workarounds and patches . But this underscores the point . The fan community has to rush in to save a game that is too restricting and too deceiving . There is nothing going on under the hood of this & quot ; game & quot ; . You do n't really train anything , since a truly trained creature would not have to be retaught every hour or so , but simply rewarded properly . And its a fact that many trained psychologists will disagree that punishments are as predictable as the game pretends to be . But do n't worry , your & quot ; creature & quot ; will clean out its database of & quot ; training & quot ; while you are away doing other things to add to your frustration.And after a while , you 'll get sick of the controls to reward/punish . You 'll be clamoring for a hotkey.What is the one single innovation in this game ? Well , there IS one . It 's the & quot ; scribbling & quot ; method used to cast spells by drawing with the mouse . Some people memorize hotkeys , others do n't . This is easy and intuitive , with a helpful legend in the lower right hand corner so you remember that moving the cursor in a swirl brings up the spell you want , etc.One innovation for a truly pathetic game . This is n't worth your time , although for the first hour you will be amazed and in awe . Then your frustration will turn to anger , and an oath to never buy another game from Peter Molyneaux ( it 's no joke his next venture is named Project Ego ... how fitting ) .	-1
Ok I was expecting alot at first cause I went to a friends house and watched him play it for awhile , it looked like lots of fun . So I installed it on my computer , which is more than adequate for any other game , but apperently not amazing enough for this game , everything went slow and even when I adjusted the picture & quot ; quality & quot ; nothing changed , the quality was the same and so was the slow speed . So I dealt with it and started playing . The tutorial was sooooo long and boring I wanted to die , but I knew soon I 'd have a creature and it would be neat . So I get through the tutorial and have to find my creature , which takes about 8 hours cause the controls for this game are the most horrible and difficult controls ever . I mean all they had to do was have the mouse control where you 're looking and then have the keyboard arrows zoom in and out , thats all , but no , it had to be impossible instead . I cant even tell you how many times I got stuck just trying to move a few feet . Then after I got my creature I started trying to be nice to villagers , but they 're all lazy and dumb , they cant do anything on their own , I killed them just for being so stupid and demanding . Then I had problems with my creature cause the bugs in the game wouldnt allow me to pick up a horse to feed it after the horse had moved out of the animals range . It was just so frustrating and bad that I immediatly uninstalled the game and returned . Its not worth anyone 's time , and what seems like it would be fun is really just tedious and boring .	-1
This game recieved a colossal amount of hype , and from all the hyperbole , was destined to be as large of a step forward in gaming as Populous , also created by Peter Molyneaux.Instead , we have an orangutan flinging feces while peasants starve at the temple because you forgot to dump grain every 30 seconds.I am a huge fan of open-architecture games . I am very excited about AI in gaming on a philosophical level . I was profoundly disappointed.It is true , my animal learned . And my animal seemed to think . But , and this is the crux of it , my animal was EXTREMELY BORING.city maintenance was the essence of tedium . picking up trees one by one and placing them into the lumber depot = not fun . Teaching my pet to do this for me = not fun . Fighting other creatures = not fun.Additionally , encountering the level that reverese ALL THE TRAINING YOU HAVE DONE TO YOUR CREATURE = wiping it off my computer . I have heard that there was a patch to remedy that particular insult to injury , but I do not care . My creature was already damaged goods.So . If you have a friend who wants to hand you a copy for free , give it a shot . Sometimes your pet will be interesting . Some of the spells are pretty . But honestly , this is not worth purchasing .	-1
This game is really boring and it has high systems requirements and video cards problems ... ... Do not BUY this game !	-1
Short and simple , folks : It 's a nice experiment- a nice buncha folks tossing their creative effluvia into the gaming market , but it just does n't cut the mustard ... Far from being the ultimate & quot ; god game & quot ; , it 's a standard RTS pain-in-the arse , with your good guys always wailing for stuff you can not provide , and & quot ; bad-guy & quot ; vilages that you have to provide these same commidities to , in order to impress , and in turn , make & quot ; good villages & quot ; . The documentation is almost comically inept and insufficient , the system requirements for optimal play are absurd ( they say they created the game on 800 MHZ comps , but I SERIOUSLY doubt it ) , and in the end , you ca n't help but feel let down.It 's a GREAT step in the right direction , but there are better games out today that make use of the full 3d format , and are far more entertaining and system-friendly.Buy it if you want a piece of gaming history- a relic- a laughable trinket that was left by the wayside during a pivotal epoch in game development . On the other hand , if you want something FUN , there are dozens of titles that will fulfill your needs , and not leave your system frozen , and your mind numb with boredom.Innovation will only carry you so far , Peter M ... Ya got ta DO something with it ...	-1
Very Very interesting idea and one of the buggiest games I 've ever played . The auto-save feature is necessary because of all of the crashes BUT after you 've been playing awhile the auto-save can take up to several minutes per save , which can be very annoying when you are right in the middle of something interesting and then , bang , auto-save , go take a nap and come back . After looking at Lionhead 's site on this software and seeing some of their comments about Quality Assurance ( ie : they basically seem to think that it would n't be necessary if EA did n't make them do it ) , I know that I will not be paying full price for any more Lionhead games until they fire whoever is in charge of QA and actually put in place a real QA process . The idea is VERY interesting and that 's why they get some points for originality ( or at least an original spin on the populas model of games ) . But they really need a debugger . Quite frankly I 'd be happy to play a FUN game with less then state of the art technology , if it is stable and fun . Bells and whistles are great but I 'm looking to have fun not get frustrated . Also , the micromanagement required to keep your people alive is very excessive . It takes alot away from the fun of the game . ... Buy The Longest Journey instead , if you are looking for a great ( stable and visually appealing ) game at an excellent price !	-1
This game admirably breaks from a lot of the god games inspired by Sim City and Civilization . Unfortunately the game designers tried to do far too much with the way the player interfaces with the game universe , gave inadequate in game tutorials and made the manual almost entirely useless . After many hours of gameplay I could n't figure out how to build a sustained civilization without giving it constant attention . I would like to say more , but I just wanted to register my frustration with this game and hopefully dissuade others from buying it .	-1
I have a P3 850 , and this game runs slow and clumsy . The interface is overwhelmingly confusing and there just doesnt seem to be that much point to the game . Sure , killing your subjects is fun and the pet feature is nice . However , the interface/controls are simply to complex . I dont know about you , but I am going back to Civ II and SC3000 . Skip Black and White..	-1
Do n't waste your time.This is forty dollars worth of tweak , and not as much fun as a typical sim .	-1
This game takes a long time . A VERY long time . For example , each time you start a new game , you MUST go through a tutorial that if you speed through it will take you no less than 45 minutes . Teaching your pet will take longer and your pet will at any given moment learn a trick that you had no intention of it learning . If you were to have two games , one for a good pet and one for a bad one . IT would take you two hours at least of straight playing to get to the 2nd level . I commend the advanced AI and the incredible graphics , but the unbearably tedious gameplay makes this game [ not worth the money ] , as soon as you decide that the time it takes to play the game is not worth the effort .	-1
While Black & amp ; White contains some entertainment value , it becomes tedious after awhile . It starts out fun , but too much of your time is gradually wasted with micro-management for your worshipers . The AI creatures are very cool however , they really do learn and are able of performing some neat tricks . However again too much time is spent teaching them basic actions that should have been a lot easier ( 2 hours of potty training is not really fun ) . Additionally the game is too short if you want it to be . You can blaze through the included scenarios fairly quickly if you put your mind to it . While playing with the creatures is indeed fun , the game bogs down too much in micro-management details , that should have been dumped in favor of more fun gameplay .	-1
Enough has already been said of the creature avatars in this game . Their AI is fantastic and they are truly fun to play with . Once past that , however , one realizes that there is n't much else to this game . Movement is awkward and difficult , the cities are unmanageable , the citizens whine constantly and irritatingly about things that they should be taking care of themselves and the missions are poorly designed . One mission simply requires you to follow a monk to his secret prayer spot by staying behind him as he walks . This is a mission that seems desinged to capitalize on the challenge presented by the horrifically innacurrate movement controls . In another mission some of your people are kidnapped by barbarians who demand animals as a ransom so they can start a circus ( ? ! ? ) And where does one find folk with the unmitigated gall to make ransom demands to a very visible deity and not expect to be smited for it ? Yet another mission has a pied piper figure leading away the village children . For some undisclosed reason , you ca n't simply pick this problem person up and toss him far out to sea ; you have to have your creature capture him . Great ideas , poor execution . But did I mention that the creatures are fun ?	-1
I enjoy animals , and this game makes great use of them.However , I have found this game to be a bit lacking in the entertainment department , and the creatures in the beginning are quite strange , to say the least ( a cow ... ? ) .The controls are also very frustrating ; I wish they were more like the Sims or Zoo Tycoon , which are similar ( execution-wise ) to this game.I want to like this , but I 'm sorry EA Games , I just ca n't .	-1
Black & amp ; White in theory sounds like a really fun game and for some I guess it is . I found the game so tedius , repititious and devoid of fun that I never even bothered to finish the first level . The idea of the creature is interesting and the AI on it is impressive but that in itself could not hold the game together . The controls are awful . It is interesting that the developers spent so much time on the & quot ; feel & quot ; of the game and making it so it was like no other that it seems that they did n't stop to think at the cumbersomeness an impracticality of the vast array of controls . Another factor to this game is that if you are going to stick it out and play the entire thing you will definately need time for it takes for what seems an eternity to complete some of the tasks of the game . All in all , this game was not for me but I could see the ultimate attraction and some people who are willing to stick it out might enjoy it .	-1
Somewhere between 3 and 5 years in the making , Black & amp ; White disappoints and irritates on so many different levels that it 's hard to know where to start . The non-intuitive control system takes hours of getting used to , and even then is clumsy and unresponsive . The graphics are not on a par with such recent titles as Giants or Sacrifice , the landscape morphs and warps as you move around it and the villagers , well , the less said about them and their unfeasibly large feet the better . The sub-plots are supposed to be humourous but are merely twee , as are the good and bad advisors . Much has been made in the gaming press of the creature AI and it may well be the best ever in a computer game , but the game itself , which should surely be the most important part , is sadly lacking . This may well be selling swiftly , but will be returned to retail outlets just as fast by all but the most persevering of gamers .	-1
I got to see Peter Molyneux demonstrate and explain Black and White in person at MIT in February of 2000 . I was intrigued by the concept and what I saw looked great , so I 've had nothing but positive vibes toward the game , and snapped it up the day it came out . However , I 've got to be honest , this game is n't for everybody . This is the first 'god ' or 'sim ' type game I 've actually ever owned , so perhaps if you 're more inclined or experienced with this type of game , you might enjoy it more than I did . However , as an action and strategy gamer , I thought I was going to collapse across my desk and cry tears of boredom.Giving B & amp ; W its due , you need only read the other reviews here . Yes , these graphics are amazing , as good as anything out there . The AI is at a whole new level , and there are things going on here that have never been seen before and it makes my head spin to think of how on earth they could have programmed them , like the gesture-recognition interface or the intriguing learning ability of the creatures . This is , no doubt , an amazing piece of art and technology.That having been said , is it any fun to actually PLAY ? For me , I 'm afraid not . The game very quickly degenerates into an endless cycle of repetitive actions like moving trees and villagers around , all in the name of expanding your 'influence ' to encompass other villages , at which point you have even more trees and villagers to move around . Add to this your basic lack of story ( do this and this and this to defeat the bad guy ! ) or characters , and what you have is pretty much a colossal bore in the opinion of this gamer . It 's far less Clash of the Titans than it is Competition of the Woodstackers . The micromanagement that you have to perform , and the complete lack of functions , interface , or information to make it any more reasonable , is just out of control . Literally . There are parts in the game where you ca n't even access the basic functions of saving and loading because those are in your 'temple ' , and sometimes you do n't have a 'temple ' yet . And this goes on for EVER , like hours and hours and hours . I read one forum post from an enthusiast who had spent ( he said ) about 20 HOURS of doing tasks like this to get through a level . And I 'd have to say , embarassingly , my own experience is similar . He did n't spend 20 hours because he was a bad player ; he spent 20 hours because the game is really that slow.The whole Tamagotchi-meets-King-Kong aspect of the game , the Creature , is an interesting idea but ultimately fails to deliver . The Creature becomes yet another thing that 's only partially under your control and which the game does n't give you the tools to manage . Classic example : the Creature eats one of your villagers . This is generally a bad thing because you need those villagers to increase your 'influence ' , so you 'd want to punish the Creature so that the behavior does n't happen again . However , the game never says & quot ; Your Creature just chewed up a villager. & quot ; Instead it says & quot ; Your Creature will eat that sort of thing more often. & quot ; Oh really ? WHAT sort of thing ? And unless you were ignoring the other twenty things that need doing and happened to be zoomed in close enough to actually identify what the Creature was eating , guess what ? Your Creature goes on scarfing up villagers . You get labelled by the game as siding with Evil and you suck , and none of it was your fault . Considering that there are only about ten possible things that the Creature can eat , including his own poop , you 'd think that the game itself would be a little more informative , or warn you before it was about to happen.Unfortunately , the game is just full of deliberate yet bad design decisions like this . You 're informed of things happening only after it 's too late to do anything about it . The concept that there is no interface , just a hand , sounds good on paper but is lousy in practice , depriving you of control and information . It 's ridiculous that you have to move the camera for miles over to the correct place on the map and then hold the hand over the right building for a few seconds just to get the one piece of information that you want . Could n't we have put that on the screen ? It seems like some of the fixes to make this such a better game are entirely obvious , but were deliberately ignored . Even the game 's manual is quite vague and seems to assume that the reader is already familiar with this kind of game , and omits a great deal of information that you 'd have to be blind lucky to figure out.Additionally , any claims that the game is some kind of psychological tool , or that your Creature comes out as a reflection of your personality , are just silly . The game basically makes its own call as to what 's good and what 's evil , and your own intentions are n't figured in at all . In some cases even your actions do n't seem to be figured in to that judgment . There 's some hype that this is a game of moral and ethical choices , and that is just not so . This game may be a first step in that direction , but this is simply a game of micromanagement ; in some senses , it 's almost kind to call it a game , period.To wrap up , on the technical end I had no problems with this game on a 1Ghz PIII with 256MB RAM and a 32MB GeForce2 . It has crashed once while I was multitasking , but other than that has been flawless , with some frame drop in extreme camera moves but overall seems well above 30fps.Anyway , definitely put some thought in before diving in to Black and White . It 's an interesting piece but it 's not for everybody .	-1
Well , this games sucks.It is not even a finished product . Big gaming companies should be punished for not delivering a finished product . It 's a different story if a game is not good , but it 's totally unacceptable if people have to pay for imcomplete product .	-1
Dont buy this game if you have a 3dfx voodoo banshee video card the only good graphics are on the creatures , the support is also terrible i called a few days ago and the support person said go to the site and download the patch , after waiting the agonising 45 minute download i tryed to run the patch and then it said & quot ; cant patch this you do not have the right version installed & quot ; How many versions are there ? ? ? ? two Words DONT BUY IT ! ! ! Lion head studios is geting NO more buisness from me ! ! !	-1
this is one of the most overrated piles of tripe ive ever playedthe graphics are pretty but you 'll need a pretty hefty card and processor to get the most out of them . my voodoo3 450mhz struggled almost constantlythe gamneplay , although hyped up something massive is dull at best . it just boils down to the people want wood so put some trees in the store . the people want food so put some food in the store . the other god wants you to get more land , put food and wood in another village 's store . etc ... sound is good but it doesnt reallt matter considering the rest of the game is so dullthe creatures although made to seem like real children are boring and essentially boils down to ape picks up man , god slaps ape , ape goes & quot ; ooh & quot ; , ape picks up another man . etc ... i suppose eventually the ape will learn not to pick up the man but you 'll have flogged this game by then.my rating : zipmaybe 4/5 if you coiuld use the cd as a coaster maybe	-1
This game is very original with good graphics . The person who thought this up was very creative . ( ... ) However , once you get in the game you will encounter a plethera of annoying bugs . Some of these are invisible creatures that wo n't move , creature wo n't eat or learn , creature wo n't interact with objects , missing sheep for sheep quest , etc . So you go download patch 1.10 and install it . Then when you try to run black and white it will start to run but the game never makes it far enough to start . It just freezes . So you use the EAsy program to report the problem ( ... ) and that program locks up your system . Congratulations , you have just wasted ( ... ) your hard earned money on a ( ... ) buggy game . ( ... )	-1
For adults , the James Perkins review of Black and White nails this game . Read it , then skip purchasing this game . I was very excited about getting it after reading/believing the hype . The creature and its & quot ; leashes & quot ; drove me insane , and detracted from the small amount of entertainment I had begun having from solving the puzzles in the game . Maneuvering is ( IMHO ) counter-intuitive , especially which way the POV revolves based on the sliding of the mouse . And the forced tutorial is mind-numbing . The only worse & quot ; forced & quot ; passage in a game is the part of NOLF where you have to ask the fat industrialist all of those inane questions .	-1
I read Osiris ' review about needing the 90MB patch , that is incorrect . That is a patch for the non-English game if people still want to here and see English language . Being from Canada , I guess he would need that . Sorry Osiris , but game companies expect that if you live in Canada and buy the game there , you will PROBABLY speak the local language , not the game 's natural English . I admit that that is a huge patch , especially if you own a modem , but at least it was made available to you . I have yet to play the game , which is why I did n't rate it high . However , I ordered it a few days ago , and should get to play it around January . I will write another review about it then . I am fairly sure I will give it a high rating then .	-1
This game is truly awful . The game has an interesting concept but the realization it horrible . You 're a God but the only way for you to do anything is with your free floating hand - which is close to impossible to control . Between that , the poor graphics , and the problems it caused with my system I gave up after a couple days . I would n't bother unless you 're into frustration .	-1
The game Black and White has some good ideas , such as being God and being able to control what was going on , but it did not meet up to the expectations . I find it really difficult to get the hang of the mouse controls , and at times it is extremely frustrating . I agree with one of the other comments made , you are following a story . You never are really in control ! I find this game disappointing and I suggest looking else where for a game in which you want control .	-1
I purchased Black and White on the advice of a friend and was told about the fun aspects of training a pet . After playing for several hours I can honestly say I was underwhelmed.While the game 's graphics were good , and I had fun for about an hour playing around with my pet and the world , there was little to keep my interest . I quickly moved onto other games and forget that I had purchased Black and White . For me , there was little substance and little to get me `` hooked '' .While I do not deny that there is a market for games like Black and White , I do believe that this market demands more challenging and compelling products.If you make it past an hour , tasks become tedious , lifeless and dull .	-1
The graphics are good but the gameplay totally sucks ! !	-1
While the thought of playing a psychopathic twisted horror version of Alice in WOnderland appealed to me at first , it quickly became tiresome . Surely the original story is twisted and psychopathic enough and this version tries very hard to disturb players but it 's plot just goes nowhere.When I loaded up this game I expected some sort of stunning adventure , only to be greeted by what seemed to be a first-person action game , such as Thief or Unreal ... but no ... it was n't that either . It was 3rd person in the style of Tomb Raider.As I started meeting NPCs I realized where I 've seen this interface before : games like Banjo Kazooie , Spyro the Dragon , Zelda and other N64 and Playstation platform adventure games ... which is just what Alice is ... a spooky platform game.Platform games being what they are , they are obsessed with coming up the most difficult way for the player to jump from point a to point b so that you can then get on with the story . After the 23rd time of falling off the checkerboard , you finally make it and are allowed to proceed with the story . But what story ? There is n't a very strong one . You are just lead by the nose and it is n't even very interesting . Just lots of fighting cards and flying spectre things.I must admit this game IS indeed visually stunning . I absolutely love the cheshire cat . He floats in and ouut of the game quite eerily and his voice is perfect . The scenery and odd backgrounds of vortexes , huge stacks of books , and such are used to try and make the player a bit uncomfortable or spooked and yes they do their job ... but in the process , though , we are not given anything interesting or challenging to do except for jumping from point a to point b 23 times.I was very disappointed with the & quot ; puzzles & quot ; presented . Nothing was really a challenge but merely an entrance to the next test of patience.To give the game credit , the graphics are impeccable , the gameplay ( running , jumping , etc ) is flawless and easy to pick up , and the mechanics of the game flow very smoothly . It 's just a pity that the creator saved all the fun for himself .	-1
... unrealized . Excellent idea , excellent graphics , completely destroyed by endless physical puzzles unrelated to the game itself . Could have been fantastic , ended up frustrating . **	-1
I was not impressed with this game . I found that when you hit the key board to move , it was too quick . I would press it once or twice and it would just spin around . Overall , I did not like this game and suggest that you look for something else .	-1
its fair to make a direct comparison to live 2000- and the conclusion is that live 2000 is a much better game . live 2001 suffers from a lack of smooth and intuitive gameplay that seemed to come so naturally with live 2000. the cut-away shots are VERY realistic and awesome looking , but the regular viewpoint of the gameplay looks a step below ( in my opinion ) of live 2000. however , easports easily still produces the best NBA simulation on the market . while live 2001 is a notch below 2000 , 2000 was one of the best sports games ever and would be hard to duplicate its success . so buy 2001 for the roster updates but dont expect to be blown away .	-1
This game is booooooorrrring . My goodness is this game boring . If you 're not asleep now , you will be once you 've played this thing . I actually think that the talking & quot ; Billy Bass & quot ; ( you know , the one in the commercials that sings ) is a whole lot more entertaining than this .	-1
This game is boring and it 's just collecting stuff in your car . I was expecting more from Rockstar than this crappy game .	-1
The basic idea is cool , the point being that you are freelancing for some criminal organization running contraband across the border while competing against cops and other organizations . It 's finally something new to the basic speeding/car-racing genre I love so much.The problem is that all the skills I 've developed in other racing games are pointless here ... you start with a selection of two cars , a big heavy SUV ( that can take a little more damage ) and a cage buggy dragster type thing . Well , in one stage you have to show off your driving skills ( no pick-ups or drop-offs of contraband ) by beating the other crime orgs , and I was unable to do it in the fast car ... so I used the slow heavy one , and finally won . Time and again the heavier car is as fast if not faster.The cops always catch up to you , too . I 'm quite good at out-braking and hand-break cornering , yet the cops in their Chevy Tahoes are able to keep up with me , even while driving a 'dragster'.The inability to outdrive the competition coupled with a a fairly boring set of tasks makes this a great game to rent for the weekend , but not to own .	-1
When I first got my PS2 ( during its early weks of release ) i got this game with it . The second I started playing it , i was n't taken away by the graphics much , or the gameplay . I find the story hard , and boring , as well as the rest of the game . Very boring , and very stupid game right here . I still have it but it also has a few layers of dust on it . Skip this one .	-1
This game disapointed me quite a lot . It has bad graphics , but the worst part is the control nothign like any other racing game except maybe pole position for Atari . Bad physics int he sense of hitting others and aceloration and everything . With the bad control I find it quite hard to get anywhere int he game as well as the sight of the game screen just mkes me want to shut it off . Sorry I do n't mean to be so rude to the game but I really am disapointed and would not recommend it if you like racing games at all .	-1
If you are looking for a good racing game , look somewhere else . This game has great graphics , but the cars control like shopping carts . If you are looking for a game that is essentially the same thing but GOOD , go buy Midtown Madness 2 . Otherwise all you racing fans better wait for Gran Turismo 2000	-1
This game is awful . I like racers , but what the heck is this ? This game has you racing against people that are either very stupid or super-human , you are not equally matched against anyone ! ... .P.S . Okay graphics are the only plus !	-1
With difficult controls , lousy graphics and repetitive music , this game is a mockery of the great James Bond.Do n't waste your money on this worthless shooter-if you want REAL James Bond , buy the movies instead .	-1
Graphic Wise This Game Is Better Than Goldeneye , But When It Comes To Gameplay This Game Falls Short . I Thought It Was Cool That The Characters Now Speak , But Still Their Mouths Do n't Move . The Biggest Loss Is That There Are No More Explosives Or Cool Guns . Where Are The RCP-90 's and Remote Mines ? If You 're Like Me and Love to Fill Your Enemies With Hot Lead Or Blow Things Up You Probobly Wo n't Enjoy This Game As Much as Goldeneye . Finally There 's The Multiplayer , Wich Is Good But Very Cheesy .	-1
This game has got great graphics , even better than the previous bond - Goldeneye . ( I loved Goldeneye that was a great game ) But ... ..the very detailed graphics have SLOWED DOWN the game . Compaired to goldeneye this game runs VERY SLOW . The controls are also different . The game play in this new bond compaired to the older one ( goldeneye ) is just terrible.If you have to choose between the new one and goldeneye buy goldeneye . If your looking for an awsome second bond for the nintendo 64 your going to have to wait . Unless you like graphics over game control do n't buy this game !	-1
If only Rare made this game , maybe it would of been better . I ca n't even compare this game to Goldeneye or Perfect Dark . Here are the reasons why I do n't like this game:1 . When you start a level , you have to wait 5-10 seconds for a level to load , which is really annoying.2 . You have to use a controller pack , so without that , the game is worthless ( I think EA really wants your money ) 3 . The game does n't even have half of the levels Goldeneye or PD has ! 4 . You do n't have ANY enegry and you get killed quick5 . You ca n't blow up anything like you can in GoldeneyeSo compared to Goldeneye , Id skip this game .	-1
Well to start off the graphics are terrible . There so boxy and have no detail whatsover , even when i run it on the highest resolution . The controls are nice , but the gameplay sux . I want to just wanted to drive and mess around in the city , but right when i push the gas the cop gets on me for no reason which get 's really annoying after about ... .10 seconds . And the street lights do n't work correctly , when the light turns green the cars do n't always go . If you like games that are boring and full of many errors that could have been easily avoided , then i guess you like this game	-1
Everyone loves this game yet everyone seems to hate it for all the same reasons and it 's a shame really . Crimson Skies was like a soon to be star standing in the wings waiting for it 's big break but when it hit the stage and stood in the lime light , it choked and fell flat on it 's face in the worst possible way . What a disappointment it was to load Crimson Skies and have my jaw instantly hit the keyboard for all it 's quirky and wonderful audio/visual treats , the voices , the music , the design , the brilliant colors and the trees ( my God the trees ! ) , only to have my guts turn while I listened to the hard drive in my Compaq PII 450 mhz system grind and groan and crackle for what seemed endless minutes as it struggled with a simple drop down menu . And lets not even get into the nearly three minutes it took to just exit the game . Oh , I have the onboard tools to run it , ATI Rage Fury Pro 32mb board and 128 sdram but it seems it does n't matter what your running , a 350 , 750 or even 1000 mhz system , you 'll simply end up spending much more time waiting to exit menu screens or load levels then you 'll ever spend playing the game . And even after an exhausting hour on the phone with our patient friends at Microsoft Tech Support , tinkering and tweaking my system , I gained very little satisfaction , although the frustration grew with the fact that this absolutely brilliant concept , wrapped up in probably one of the best designed packages ever to hit store shelves was so horribly flawed that it squeezes the very life out of what could of have been one of the best games of the year if not ever . If I were to rate this game on sheer fun , excitement and originality , there 's no question it earns a solid five stars , but the endless waiting for those brief brilliant moments when I actually got to scream through amazingly detailed billowing clouds and over Crimson Skies ' breathtaking landscapes made me just walk away , shaking my head , muttering to myselfwith great disappointment , `` so close and yet so very far '' . Maybe someday they 'll find the silver bullet patch that will redeem this worthy title , if not , it runs the very real risk of going down in software history as the Heaven 's Gate of PC gaming . Here 's to hopping that does n't happen .	-1
This joystick was my last attempt at trying to buy a force-feedback joystick . Without getting too wordy , there is just far too much deadspace in the joystick 's center . Even spending extensive amounts of time trying to calibrate with the joysticks calibration utility and manually adjusting the calibration with a directX calibrator it was still impossible to get a true center.Unfortunately , that 's only the first problem one is likely to come across . The gyro motors used to center and move the joystick are very poor . I found that after as little as 1 month of sporadic use , the twist function on the joystick failed to work properly . After dismantling the joystick I found that the joystick was just shoddily constructed of poor components.I would n't recommend this joystick for even the most casual of gamers . Force feedback really , really is n't worth it . Very few computer games are even programmed with Force Feedback in mind . I recommend going with a more reliable , spring-based , joystick such as the Saitek Cyborg EVO .	-1
I have had two Logotech sticks : the first , Logitech 's Wingman 3D . It lasted a year and a half , but toward the end lost center and never recovered . My second , this one , lasted for 3 months . Then the twist started to go leaving me guessing where neutral on my rudder was ( every time ) . I have read of others who have had similar centering issues : it is a good product out of the box , but the quality of components inside the base are not what I expect.I ended up replacing it with a Saitek Evo Cyborg Force- it may cost a little more , but it is much more adjustable , and the feel is more substantial to me.I wo n't be buying Logitech again from my experience . Some others may have had better luck- but from the centering issue , well that 's pretty basic in any flight sim .	-1
I usually like Logitech products , which is why I 'm amazed they would actually put their name on this garbage . To start with , 2 out of the 7 push buttons have intermittent faults while pressing down continuously . The 8 way directional hat , has a hard time detecting presses to the right . The left Joystick looses it 's calibration after about twenty to forty five minutes of game play . After that , it simply will not go to the right . Since it was decided that this stick was above mere calibration , none was included . The only way to resolve the problem is to reboot the computer when this happens . A real mood killer while playing any game . I 'm a avid gamer and have other game pads , wheels and sticks , so no it 's not the computer or USB port . They all work fine , I just thought this one would be better . Next time I 'll think a little harder if it say 's Logitech on it .	-1
I believe this is not as good as compared to the Sidewinder that Microsoft makes . It is a very clumsy controller . It may look like a dual shock playstation controller but by no means does it perform up to the standards of the playstation controller . I got it for ( X ) and I sold it already for ( X ) . I tried the Sidewinder and thought it was a better controller and as the old saying goes , `` You get what you Pay for . ''	-1
1 ) Stiff , clicky , small , inset buttons . Nothing like a PS2/PSX pad 's nice buttons.2 ) Badly placed throttle . The shoulder buttons ( which are the clickiest of them all ) are big , but if you 're like me your pointer fingers tend to travel up while using the shoulder buttons . And that makes for a badly placed throttle above the right shoulder button.3 ) Sticks will eventually break off . I got a free replacement LWMRP , but I 'm afraid to use it because I know that one will break as well . I suggested to them that they use sturdy metal sticks if they 're going to insist on the skinny necks of the sticks , but they have n't modified it yet.4 ) Stiff D-Pad/POV pad . And it 's hard to navigate with it as well since you ca n't feel the direction without looking down to see if you 're pressing it right.5 ) Inset Mode and Rumble buttons hard to press in sometimes.Two great things ? The handles and rumble feature . Very comfortable grips and very solid rumble features .	-1
First off let me start off by saying check reviews for this game on game spot you will see a rating of 6.2 out of 10 by 177 votes , there is 18 votes on amazon and somehow it is rated 8.5 out of 10 . This is a game that is basically only playable if your a child who wants to play a shooter game that is n't quite as violent , challenging or story driven . Not the worse game in existence , but this definitely a middle of the pack title 3 or 5 stars is generous in my opinion .	-1
Not quite as good as I remembered playing it . The gameplay could use alot of work . Nowhere near as good as the first game	-1
Normally I 'm all for explosive combat situations . I bought this game thinking to myself it would be an excellent addition to the PS2 ( I was expecting Vigilante 8 , just with tanks ) . Excitement ? It 's got to be hiding in there somewhere , but I have n't seen it yet . The graphics are ok , but nothing mind-numbing . The gameplay is anything but fast-paced . The areas are dull , the control is obnoxious . The only reason it earned two stars is that it *is* sorta fun in multiplayer mode ( if you do n't mind the flat-terrain and the dull weapons ) . Rent it , or better yet , just play V8 on the N64 and forget this even exists .	-1
Encouraged by the rave reviews , I bought this game but ended up tossing it into the garbage after 6 hours of play . Aside from the horrible 1996 graphics , there is dead boring game play on a buggy interface.You spend hours building cities that lack character and armies symbolized by one awful figure . Dragging your people around the map is a real challenge because you can only move them a tiny bit each turn , while getting them onto ships is even more frustrating due to the awkward tile design that governs movements on the map . Historical value is 0 , as ancient Egyptians build cities named Melbourne and Helsinki and the American Empire begins with Abe Lincoln in 600 B.C.Do yourself a favor and grab a copy of Age of Kings or even better , Combat Mission -- if you like WWII themes -- and you wo n't be disappointed . They do cost more , but you get what you paid for .	-1
This game really does [ stink ] ... . I 've tried on easy and used the cheat menu and still lost . It 's confusing what to do and the graphics make it more confusing . If you want to get this game you better be a rocket scientest to figure out it 's graphics and the way of trade . You have to get in war to get land and hope the people will be happy with you by the time your finished , controls [ stink ] , do n't use your mouse use your up down left right on the keyboard to move your people , the mouse just skrews up everything . And even if you try everything you can either you lose or you have to use cheats and still your called `` Worthless '' at the end , a bad game to play . With it 's simple plan they could get the graphics at least good as the sims , and they could have made the skills easier to understand , it 's all confusing to me.Graphics:3/10Fun:3/10Gameplay:6/10Sound:2/10Overall:3/10 ...	-1
Despite almost universal praise in the games press , this is a terrible , terrible game . I 'm horrified that it seems to have gathered so many good reviews . It 's essentially a dated , semi-professional Quake 2 mod , with the addition of a novel damage-modelling system that lets you shoot people 's arms off . Made even worse by a useless attempt to give the game some authenticity - the box , CD , installation and loading screen are covered with warnings that the game is a realistic depiction of modern warfare , all of which exist purely as a tease , because the game itself is essentially a G.I . Joe cartoon with blood . The violence is strictly cartoonish - shoot somebody in the leg , and he hops around yowling - and the novelty wears off after a minute or so . Everything else about the game fails , comically so , from the interactive music ( which , because of the game 's lack of any slow bits , stays in 'combat mode ' almost all the time , negating the point ) , to the 'stealth element ' ( make too much noise and bad guys appear in the level , usually in totally illogical places ) to the interface , which looks as if it had been drawn by a backwards child . The gameplay itself is pure Quake 2 - you run through a linear track , along which bad guys are placed at regular intervals . Sometimes you have to press a button to open a door . If something moves , you shoot it . Most usually , nothing moves - the bad guys are , in the words of GameSpot , 'strawberry-jam-filled turrets ' . Anyway , if you want a decent modern shoot-em-up with stealth elements , get 'Project IGI ' . If you want violence , trip somebody up and then jump on them and have a fight .	-1
It has been awhile since I played this , I have the PS2 version and I I bet you could get a used copy for about 99 cents . This is probably the most violent game I have ever played . There is a violence lock in the game that can let you control whether dismembered limbs or blood are allowed . If you turn everything on , you have one big goreapalooza . This game goes beyond mature . Dont let the kids get there hands on this !	-1
When my printer prints , there are blank lines in the middle of the picture . Does n't work . Ca n't fix it either .	-1
I thought madden 2001 will have a lot of difference with madden 2000 just like what fifa did , but the game was not even better a single bit ! The linesmen in the game still are n't 3d modeled but still are 2d modeled ! The graphics may be a bit better but has made the game very slow ! Then i thought about the new players in miami dolphins . At madden 2000 , dan marino was concederd still playing in real life but was not ! And i saw that in madden 2001 , Dan marino is still concedered as a player at the dolphins . The whole setup was bad . Madden also put in european football teams which i think is gossip . If those teams they put were real , i 'd bet that the players are n't real players at all !	-1
I will give credit where it 's due , this game does have good graphics and a lot of options . But that 's about it . I was so dissapointed when I got this game home after having heard that it was & quot ; the greatest football game ever & quot ; and so on . this game is such a waste of time . if this is the best that the playstation has to offer then we 're in trouble . The AI is absurd to say the least . The dumbest plays happen and succede for no reason while simple passes often fly half way across the screen from where they 're supposed to . The computer constantly makes false calls that do n't even have anything to do with the play . The play editor is complete garbage . If you do n't believe me , just make up a play and try it in the game . The commentary makes me want to listen to chalk grating against a board rather than the stupid things they keep saying over and over and over again . The dificulty setting is useless too . The game is the same difficulty no matter where you set it , the only difference how many points you and the computer will score . I could go on for a long time talking about how poor this game is but I 'm going to stop and actually go trade it in at EB now instead . Maybe I 'll get a worthwhile game instead , or maybe I 'll just sit around and watch the grass grow . That would probably be just as entertaining .	-1
I am not what one might call an overly hyped video game player . I dont go out and buy the next installment of FF ( after VIII , it really got bad imo ) , I enjoyed .hack and its storyline though ( but I felt that the series could have been brought together into one large game like with FFVII ) . Then there is the PE video game , I loved the first one , had some trouble , but over all it was a great game . I knew there was a part 2 , so I found a copy and started playing it . Boy ... was I disappointed.First , the game play is terrible , the movement is haphazard , the angles are horrific , and its down right troublesome ( unlike the first one ) . I loathed the movement , there was none of the smoothness of the first one.Second , I hated the leveling , what leveling there is . You dont go up in your hit points , you barely go up in MPs and parasite powers , and even worse , when you go to a next scene ( from one point to the next in the story ) you go back down to your 100 hit points.Third , which is related to the angles , the combat is atrocious . There is nothing quick and exciting , in fact its down right stressful because ( since you rarely have a chance to get items for health unless you spend & quot ; money & quot ; between the scenes at home base ) you end up dying again and again until low and behold you get through with maybe 1 hit point left and then WHAM you are hit by another attack and you have to do the whole stupid thing over again . Even worse , the camera angles are so bad you rarely if ever see the enemies and just shoot blindly.Fourth , connected to three , the weapons are horrible to use . You end up getting killed repeatedly because you have to jerkingly reload so many times that when you are facing multiple opponents ( unlike the smoothness of the original first story ) and youre going to get killed unless you spend hours dealing with one combat situation.Fifth , items , with the original first game , you got lots and lots of items . With this game , you are in luck if after three or four attacks ( bringing you down to 1 hit point ) you finally strike it and get a recovery2 pill that brings you back up to original hit points but then again those hit points are taken down again by the end of the next combat round.While the story line might be interesting , it fails in comparison to the first one and by all means , the poorness of this game in the controlling just makes you so fed up that you dont care how this story ends . Its a bad , bad game that could have been a great sequel if only the company had followed the original game 's beauty . Dont buy this game unless you have lots of headache medicine.I ca n't believe it , but I actually hate this game .	-1
The first PE had problems - Aya 's painfully slow movement , some bad camera angles , etc . - but was overall a good game . This ... this is a travesty.First , the movement system is *miserable* . Character-relative movement is an abomination , painful , and results in many many deaths . Second , Aya 's Parasite powers are pathetic - how did she go from taking on Eve and the Ultimate Being to this ! ? Eve would have turned this Aya into mincemeat . Third , why is Aya suddenly young and dressing in bizarre fashion ? I dunno about you , but *I'd* wear body armor , or at least long pants , when confronted with creatures like that.In terms of plot and characterization ... there is n't any that I had the patience to see . Aya 's sole reaction on seeing a human ( or apparent human ) mutate boils down to so what . This , from a woman who freaked at seeing the rat mutate , who has not seen anything else mutate since finishing off the Ultimate Being ... who seemed to think nothing else was going to mutate.Stupid puzzles , uninteresting secondary characters ( where 's Ben ? Maeda ? Daniel ? Wayne ? ) ... Pass on this one . Play the original again .	-1
Okay , seriously , there needs to be some straightening out here.Let me get one thing out of the way first : I love this series . The first game blew me away when I played it , and I ca n't even play it now without remembering just about everything that happened , in sequence . The second game had a nice narrative , but fell far short from the original . I love it , but it deserves the following spanking . Allow me to explain . A few major spoilers ahead . *Battle System : This is the one big , fat , 800-pound gorilla in the elevator for this game . Seriously , are you people REALLY so ecstatic that its real-time ? Parasite Eve was an RPG , and a damned good one at that ; ... this ... is an action-horror survival game with some amount of RPG thrown in , just enough to earn the genre title for most . It 's basically Resident Evil minus the zombies . That 's it . The targeting is terrible at all times , the camera angles make it nigh impossible to target the appropriate thing that you want dead , and ... well , it 's way too easy . Once you 've pointed at the thing , you just shoot it . Bam . Dead . Next one . I died , maybe , four times total , two of those were near the end of the game , and one was from that GODS-FORSAKEN MAN-FACED HORSE THING . In fact , I would n't even call this an RPG ; it 's just a run-of-the-mill survival horror , with less horror and more survival - and even that 's iffy , because I was only truly afraid , maybe , once . *Story : It 's your atypical `` big bad corporation makes things worse '' scenario that 's been beaten to death before this game , and has been beaten to death since . The only shining moments in this game are the boss battles , which provide just a LITTLE more difficulty than the normal fights ( and , if you 're a total perv , the shower scene ; admit it , you whacked off to that too when you were that age ! ) . *Characters : Aya and Eve are the only two that stand out in this game , with Aya winning the race by a mile . Still , I would love to see how Eve turns out in The Third Birthday , but I doubt they 'll even add her in , since she was sorta a side-effect in this game as well ! Everyone else is , for the lack of no better words , forgettable . I do n't even remember what the gun-toting redneck 's name was ! Kyle was wooden , would only show up once in a while , and barely did much of anything to advance the plot . *Overall : This game was just plain forgettable . The combat only works when you beat it , the story is pretty lame , and the characters are boring . Worst of all , there 's STILL no voice-acting ( TWO LINES ! ! They were `` FREEZE '' and `` Hmm '' . That 's not voice acting ! ) , STILL very little background on Aya beyond the `` she was in a car accident and got an implanted eye from her sister , who was infected with the Rage Monkey Virus or whatever , and now she can use magical powers that are vaguely explained which were 'awakened ' during the events of the first game '' , and someone STILL needs to give Aya some more personality ! Okay . I think I 'm done . Now I need to go play the first game so I can remember what it was like . *deep sigh*	-1
Ok. Sure it 's a new year for Ea 's hockey games , but basically , it 's the same game as last season 's effort . It plays the same , looks similiar ( if not worse ) , sounds the same , even scoring goals on a regular basis is the same.The good . It 's hockey . It has some good options like the momentum meter , big shot , big check , new NHL Challenge to boost your created players attributes , and ( my favorite ) the franchise mode for season play.The bad . Just about everything else I did n't mention that was good . Sounds silly , right ? Well , there 's not really much of that & quot ; in-between & quot ; stuff to like or dislike in NHL 2001 . A lot of the new options are over-hyped . Take the momentum meter , for example . Sure it 's a great and realistic option , but with the terrible gameplay , it does n't do much but make the crowd louder -- Not to mention the extremely annoying Play-by-play guys talking about momentum ( oh , how annoying it is ! ) . I mentioned bad game play ? You bet . Control is flimzy , at best . At times , I 'll stop my player and try to reverse my direction to only not be able to do just that -- You just ca n't go the opposite direction sometimes -- WHY ? ! ? Players do n't move like you want them to . Is it skating physics that are hampering the controls ? No . It 's poor programming . If your players is n't in a straight line of the puck , you ca n't get gain control of it without some major problems ( anyone who 's chased an iced puck to only have the cpu get it first because of this , knows exactly what I 'm talking about ) . Fighting looks silly in this game -- nuff said about that . The other major flaw is the goalies . What the heck happened here ? Goalie animation is SO slow , it does n't match the actual speed of the game . It 's so bad , cross-ice one-timers from the red line will beat nearly any goalie . Going in on a breakaway ? Left-handed shooters just need to be slightly left-center to the goal to score ( before you reach the crease , just tap the shot-button when slightly left center to the opposing goalie -- reverse this if it 's a right-handed shooter ) . Is it that simple ? You bet . Playing anything but 5 minute periods can result in a football-like score . Goalie animation need serious improving -- Just watch a goalie make a sprawling save attempt . It takes so long for him to get back up , a goal is sure to be scored ( & quot ; He 's fallen ' and ca n't get up ? & quot ; ) .To me , this game was more frustrating than fun . I like realism -- this one has some , but not enough . It has good options , but not done correctly . It has the best sound ( by far ) than any hockey game out there , but that 's it . I think EA concentrated on the PS2 version of NHL 2001 because this is n't really a new game from last year -- just a new title . Check out my review of NHL Faceoff 2001 to compare this years hockey titles on the PS1 .	-1
Do you remember the Sega Genesis ? Do you remember how EA treated the final few iterations of its hallmark sports titles on the Genesis ? College Football 96 and 97 were practically identical , NHL 96 , 97 , 98 were practically identical , NBA Live 96 , 97 , 98 were practically identical . Welcome to the waning days of Sony 's Playstation , and we have the same situation . EA rehashing previous versions of games with a few pointless afterthoughts thrown in so people do n't accuse them of outright larceny.NHL 2000 , though probably the best PSX hockey game , was FAR from perfect . Annoying goalie AI meant great shots were deflected , yet off-balance blind backhand shots from the blue line went in . The game play was much too fast to be anywhere near realistic , and the addition of the & quot ; mug shot & quot ; ( triangle button cross check ) was among the worst sports-game decisions ever made , making for constant ridiculous goon-centric gameplay.Well , guess what ? It 's all back ! A carbon-copy with updated rosters and a simple binary number change ( 2000 to 2001 ) . So if shelling out 40 bones for what essentially equals a can of paint is your idea of money well spent , then fire up the one-click . Otherwise , send EA some nice hate-mail , and save your pennies for NHL 2001 on the almighty Playstation 2 .	-1
What a tragedy this is . It has almost everything going for it . Medal of Honor : Underground sports the best sounds in any game I 've ever heard . The ambiant noise in the background is just spooky ! Sometimes I ca n't tell if those footsteps I 'm hearing is just part of the track playing or if I have woken up a guard- which means they have seamlessly instilled a sense of danger just by their background music . Also , I like the fact that you are using authentic weapons . None of this & quot ; alien lazer gun & quot ; crap . The graphics would be passable for the game , but this is where we start running into problems.For one thing , you can wake up a guard halfway across the level , run all the way back to the starting point , and have him standing miles away from you , emptying clip after clip of ammunition into the walls . And the worst part is , a lot of these bullets , due to the HORRIBLE clipping problems in this game , pass right through said walls and hit you ! Not only this , but you can expect to take a ton of hits in this game . True , health packs are plentiful , but does n't that cut down on the realism ? I want a game where my character is somewhat human . Any real person could not take 30 or more bullets to put down . Neither could their opponents . In fact , those Nazis must have undergone some kind of genetic splicing , as they all are some of the best crackshots I have ever seen . I could be standing at one end of a 50 yard bridge ( as I have in one of the later levels ) waiting to pick someone off , when all of a sudden bullets start whizzing out of the darkness right at my head ! This is absolutely inexcusable . My enemies should have the same field of vision as me . And maybe , if it is n't too much to ask , some of their shots could miss their target once in a while.It saddens me that one of the greatest attempts at a realistic war game ends up being such a flop . I refuse to even look at the first game , despite the rave reviews . This is the closest I have ever come to breaking my PS controller . Back slowly away from this one ...	-1
As a fan of WCW Mayham I expected great things from its sequel WCW Backstage Assault but I was in for a different kind of game . First of this game does n't have a wrestling ring and no I am not joking by the way either . Instead all of the action in the squared circle does n't take place in the ring at all , it takes place in the backstage areas . Hench the name Backstage Assault for this WCW game . I wonder why EA decided to remove the ring because without the ring it just a hardcore anything goes wrestling game . The graphics are pretty bad I mean WCW Mayham had better graphics and the wrestler sprints were huge and detailed compared to this gamee were the character models like bad . You have a huge roster of wrestlers to choose from as well as hidden wrestlers . You get to go on a career mode where you can win the WCW Heavyweight belt , WCW Hardcore , and WCW United States belts only ( I think the WCW TV belt is n't in the game ) . You only get to fight one on one so that just sucks because you ca n't have 4 people play with you since its only a two player game . It lacks game modes like WWF Smackdown ! series which is way better and funner . EA tried something different just failed with the game and should of really just stuck with WCW Mayham 's formula instead .	-1
Usually when a descent game comes out , you 'd expect the follow up to be better . This is not one of those games . For what ever reason , somebody decided to completely remove the wrestling ring . You start out in a back lot & just brawl . Here 's the strange thing . To win you pin your opponent on the floor . If its a brawl , you 'd think you just have knock out your opponent . You can move from one area to the next , but there is no ring . If I wanted a fighting game , I could have bought something else.I also did n't like the selection screen . It 's divided where you ca n't see all of the wrestlers in the game . The only good aspect of this game is that the commentary from Tony Schiavone & Bobby & # 34 ; The Brain & # 34 ; Heenan is good . That 's not enough to make it a great game though .	-1
I am a huge WCW fan and I am angry and sad because it does n't come on any more . I love WCW Mayhem by Electronic Arts , and that was their first wrestling game , and this is their second , but it is something that you dig out of a litter box . I do n't like this game because there are only about four weapons laying around and when you use a weapon about three times it turns into dust and that makes it impossible to win a first blood match ( they 're nearly impossible to win with weapons anyways ) . Also , the backstage areas that you have to wrestle in are smaller than the wrestling ring itself . There are only about two moves that you can do besides punching and kicking and you have to win a match , which is almost impossible , to unlock a new move . It is also very confusing to even start a match on this game . The graphics would look better if you cracked the television screen with a hammer . WCW Nitro is better than this game . Any wrestling game , even on Atari , if they have a wrestling game for it , is better than WCW Backstage Assault . The only thing this game is good for is to keep a fire burning for a couple of extra minutes .	-1
I love wrestling sure , I love video games sure . But WCW : Backstage Asssault is NOT wrestling and it 's hardly a video game . When EA came out with its first WCW game , WCW Mayhem , I picked it up on opening day . And a day passed and my copy was back on the store shelf . I was looking forward to backstage assault , hoping EA would correct their mistake . NOPE . again my copy is back on the store shelf . First off , I am a wrestling fan , and I love harcore matches . But no ring in the game at all ? Wrestling is not just fighting backstage it requires a ring to wrestle in . The graphics run as smooth as silk , I 'll give them that . But the sound ? Bad . The create a wrestler was the same as mayhem with very few tweaks . Save your money and buy Smackdown 2 : Know Your Role . At least thats good	-1
A horrible game that features all the top stars of the defunct company and no ring whatsoever .	-1
Ouch . This game is just ... ouch . Maybe the developers behind this did n't test the game . At all . That might explain the atrocious gameplay we see here today . The music is the only plus ( and that 's only because George Williams composed it ) . Yoda must be rolling in his grave .	-1
When purchasing the game i heard all the decent to horrible reviewes it received , but i still purchased it . Dont make the same mistake i did , X-Squad is a truly bad game which makes you second guess PS2 's capabilities ( at least it did for me ! )	-1
Another review to a average game . Well , i need to put my opinion to it . Pretty good for a early PS2 game , but then i did n't hear about PS2 until 2001 , this game came out 2000 . The charecters are godawful . They say affirimitive 4 times before doing something . The voice acting sounds like they are reading from cue cards . Syphon Filter 2 is a lot better than this game , and it 's on PS1 ! EA could 've done so much better . The A.I . is pathetic . Not much `` stealth '' ither . The graphics , gameplay , and choosing your weapons through points save this from a 1 .	-1
I consider myself an average video gamer ( no hardcore by any means ) . For some reason , I found this game incredibly hard to play . The game itself is a very beautiful game . Graphics are top notch . But like everyone else who commented on this game , that 's about it . In the first week that I played this ( first day just watching the history part ) , I was rather confused that all I did was keep hitting the X button . I could n't even tell if I actually won the battles or if I lost them . I even bought the matching guide for it , but even the guide was confusing.As an average gamer , this is a purchase I regret .	-1
If your a stratagy lover and have patience of steel perhaps you will like this game . It has alot of history to it if your looking for a social studies lessen and decent graphics , but other than that ... well ... thats about it for this game , theres not to much more i can say about it .	-1
When I started playing this game the first thing that hit me was the terrific battle scenes that were displayed in the well done opening credits and the very similar feel that the game had to romance of the three kingdoms . Unfortunately after game play began all my hopes for the game deteriorated into a free-for-all of unrealistic combat between armies that I had little to no control over . I had hopped to be able to have some amount of control over the game but instead I found myself watching volley after volley of animated musket fire and screaming at the computer to let me do something . Somehow I managed to beat my way through most of the game despite having no concept of the controls.This game is not worth any amount of money , if you wish to play it find a friend and play his copy , renting is simply too much money .	-1
Graphically this is a nice game , but the gameplay becomes repetitive and boring . The cut-scenes , while visually impressive , become annoying very quickly . Also winning battles is far too easy , and there is little story line in the game .	-1
this is n't really a fun game it is basically a look at how great the PS2 graphics are for one of the first games I think its ok but still thsi game is n't really worth the money get Dynasty Warriors	-1
I thought this was going to be like Ghengis Khan for the original Nintendo , but on a grander scale ... . it turned out to be more like chess on a grander scale . The graphics are alright , the game play is lame , and the movies are pretty much the same . It 's not as advertised .	-1
. . If it were n't for the fact that you just do n't get that much in return for the amount of time you spend setting the game up . The creator of the game spends a majority of the first 3 hours of & quot ; game play & quot ; giving you an in-depth look at Japanese history , and whereas this is interesting and all , it 's not what I bought the game for.I was looking for the old time fun of & quot ; Nobunaga 's Ambition & quot ; ( sp ? ) for the original Nintendo . I used to spend hours tinkering with that game ; playing and replaying different scenarios . This game does n't give you the option of deciding which battles to fight . It just takes you to the next one and assumes that 's where you want to go.The animations are . . . good . Not great ; certainly not above the standard I 've been seeing in other PS2 games . The real drawback to the animations is that you get the same ones every time . . If you fire a cannonade 5 times , you sit throught the same animation 5 times- and you ca n't stop it once it starts . If your cavalry charges 30 times , you sit through the same animation 30 times . . .On the plus side : The whole game is attractive , with more detail per character ( story-wise ) than many I 've seen . And you DO get a MASSIVE amount of history in the game ( like it or not ) , not to mention a terrific glossary of terms and additional historical materials on the disk.I 'd have given this game 3 or even 4 stars if it had given more to me . Unfortunately , more money and effort was spent on the animations than the storyline and playability . Do n't get me wrong , I LOVE games that require a high degree of concentration , but this just got boring after a short amount of time . Anyone have a copy of Nobunaga 's Ambition ?	-1
I went out and rented this after reading reviews saying that it has great visuals , and i agree . It makes full use of its DVD-format . The cutscenes are great , the gameplay , however , is n't . If you 've done one level you 've done them all . Each one is the same thing , get your army , beat up this guy , and your done . You get very few choices concerning what kind of troops , and it got very repetitive after the first level . I think it could really have been a great game if they had n't spent so much time on the graphics . Overall , not a very good game , I found the cutscenes to be better than the game itself . I really reccomend not buying this game , I 'd wait until they come out with more DVD format games .	-1
This game would n't play in my PS2 . I tried it on 3 different systems and it skipped on all of them . Maybe it was the seller , I do n't know but I never got a chance to experience this game .	-1
I hope NBA games get better because this is a disappointment . The game is just like PS1 counterpart , with slightly better graphics . I bought this game because I wanted a basketball game and that out of all the ones coming out , this is the better one . Why could n't EA do the same for b-ball like they did for football & amp ; snowboard ?	-1
MO ' MONEY WAISTED , MO ' MONEY WAISTED , MO ' MONEY WAISTED , MO ' MONEY WAISTED , MO ' MONEY WAISTED , MO ' MONEY WAISTED ! ! ! ! ! ! ! For all old school NBAlive heads you got what you wanted , your old game back again with a slight facelift . For a system with a 128bits , you would think that E.A . could have improved the graphics a lot with all the time they had to work on it . Game play has not change at all and this disappoints me the most about this game . The need for a & quot ; dunk & quot ; button is ridiculous . Why ca n't you just go to the whole and score according to their skill . The only change that 's noticed in the graphics is on the action replay . The only props I 'm given for this game is the cross over dribble , Sega could have done better . Over all the Nba2k1 is a much , much better game . If you 're able to put these 2 games ( NBAlive & amp ; NBA2k1 ) side by side , you noticed right off that Sega spent more time in the designed room .	-1
As a long time fan of the NBA Live series , I can honestly say that I purchased the PS2 almost only to play this game . NBA Live 2000 was so good , with the challenges and the unlocking hall of fame players , that I expected this game to blow my mind . Unfortunately , it only blew a hole in my wallet.First off , the gameplay is sluggish and staid . Player movement seems barely a step faster than slow motion video . Power forwards like Elton Brand are treated as 2nd class players , not able to score and rebound . The post up moves are a big yawn , given the game 's focus on guards.Secondly , they eliminated the 'fantasy draft ' option whereby all the players are stripped from their team and reordered based on your and the computer 's picks . This option was made even better in NBA Live 2000 as when you unlocked the classic players you could thrown them into the draft too . We had Wilt and Karl Malone as our back court for example . In this game , none of that is possible.Finally , the graphics are subpar . Not only are the faces unrecognizable , but if you notice , all the ears of every player have this white 'glint ' in the middle of the ear , making the ear look misshapen , like the slave race that served the Shape Shifter Dominion rulers in Star Trek Deep Space 9 . In addition , no one has tattoos . I care little for them myself , but given that almost every NBA player has one , what is the point in not doing it here ? To be honest , I was so disappointed in this game , I considered returning my PS2 . If you have any desire to get an EA sports game , get Madden NFL 2001 , that is an example of what the PS2 can do , and an example of how EA could have done their NBA franchise .	-1
One of the most anticiptated sports games for the Playstation 2 turns out to be one of the 1st bombs for the system ! I 've been an EA sports- NBA Live fan for over 8 years now . Playing it on all the major systems ; like , Playstation , PC 's , Genesis , Super NIN , etc.. So I 'm a devoted NBA Live fan . This game is a complete disgrace to the series ! You can tell that they rushed the product to compete with other games that came out the same time ; like , ESPN NBA 2 Night and NBA Hoopz.Okay , let 's go over the Pro 's of the game . Yes it 's got Michael Jordan in it , and yes it 's got classic legendary teams on it . Overall though , I do n't think that balances out the Con 's of the game . The biggest disappointment being the response time from when you hit the buttons , to the time it actually does the movement . You can press the button to shoot the ball , and release it before it even does it on the screen . It 's that bad ! The movements are pretty choppy also , it 's not fluent . You can be driving to the hole , and it would be real sluggish . Also , the percentage ratio of making a basket is EXTREMELY low ! You can be wide open for a 5 foot jump shoot , and completely miss 10 shots ! You pretty much have to dunk it to score . Another big con are the players . Yes , the body shape fits the actual players , but none of the faces look anything like the players at all ! I rather take a buffed out Reggie Miller with a face that matches ( like in NBA 2K1 for the Dreamcast ) , rather then the actual shape of a skinny Reggie Miller with the face of a complete stranger . What ... some more Con 's ? Well , they took out the Franchise mode , from previous games , as well as the 3 point contest . Why , I do n't know ? Next year , they should bring back the Slam Dunk contest on the game ( remember Jordan vs . Bird ? ) . Just like they brought back fighting in hockey games ! So overall , the game was n't worth the $ 49.99 . I thought it would match up with the same quality as NBA 2K1 for the Dreamcast , ( like Madden 2001 for PSX2 and NFL2k1 for Dreamcast ) , but it does n't even come close . I 'm getting tired of companies rushing to put out games . Do n't they realize that when people are devoted NBA Live or Madden fans ( or any game ) would rather wait for a great quality game .	-1
The only reason why I purchased PS2 over the Dreamcast is because EA Sports only writes games for Playstation . And I usually love EA Sports games , but this game is just horrible . I can not believe that the same company that developed Madden would associate their name with this product.First the positives : 1 . ) As usual the graphics are pretty good and 2 . ) the stadiums are customed to the team . 3 . ) The game play is challenging which could make for fun games . 4 . ) The one-on-one mode is great and features many of the all time greats.Now the negatives : 1 . ) I do n't believe there is no franchise mode . That is just a terrible decision not to include the franchise option . 2 . ) The court is too small , whenever you spin or do a cross over move you go out of bounds or nearly go out of bounds . 3 . ) And on that note the game play is not very realistic . As just stated the cross over and spin moves are too wide . Also in the post you ca n't back anyone down ( they do n't move ) and the post moves are not very good ( no drop step ) . 4 . ) The shooting is terrible , although in the 2000 version it was too easy to hit a shot , in this version of the game it is way too difficult . Jump shots from 10-15 feet nearly never go in . 5 . ) Also it is too difficult to get a rebound . Your player can be right next to the ball and not grab it , while the computer 's men all converge on the ball . 6 . ) Sometimes the game does not want to let you dunk when you have an open lane to the basket or on a fast break . You stop and take a short jump shot , and half the time you miss . 7 . ) The menu operations are completely different than other EA Sports games ( they need some uniformity ) .I recommend that you do not purchase this game . EA Sports should be ashamed of this game and should go back to the drawing board .	-1
I am a big NBA live fan , and i tell you this is not worth your time ! I have playd LIVE since it was on supernintendo , and this game is a waste ! The graphics are crisp , but the moves are slow , the play control is in no comparison the other versions of live on the PS1 . PLEASE do not encourage the purchasing of this game ! ! EA sports did a HORRIBLE job , after madden 2001 they give us this weak title ... ..	-1
This is a terrible game , not what I expected for a PS2 game made by one of the better known gaming companies EA sports . The graphics are ok , sometimes some of the players look the same , not to realistic IMHO . The worst part of it is , the gameplay.They seem unresponsive at times and takes awhile getting used to ( that is if you do n't quit before that ) I gave NBA 2K1 a 3 1/2 stars for DC , but after playing NBA LIVE It 's a 4 1/2 . Save your money and cross your fingers for next years release , or if you have a DC pick up NBA 2k1 ! Bottom Line NBA LIVE is an AIR BALL ! Grade : D GAMER247 is OUT !	-1
This game is absolute garbage . I opened the box and I could 've sworn my dog went in the house . It is definitely not up to par with other NBA Live games . Graphically , it looks like they should 've released it on PS1 or Sega Genesis . The players look nothing like the real thing unlike Madden for PS2 . The only highlight of the game is Michael Jordan and I feel sorry that he had to be in this game . If you want an exceptional basketball game pick up NBA2k1 . If you do n't have a Dreamcast just buy NBA Live 98 or Lakers vs. Celtics or even Double Dribble and you can get the same appeal as this piece of junk . Do n't buy it , Do n't rent it , and if your friend has one beat him up and tell him that you never want to borrow it . I have one for sale if anybody wants it . Never been played .	-1
I have a Dreamcast and a Playstation 2 and except for maybe 2 or 3 titles I think the Dreamcast is winning in the gaming department . I bought NBA live and was very upset with everthing but the graphics . Now a days we expect great graphics what we want is game play , and in this area NBA Live 2001 hits the bottom of the fish pond . NBA2k1 is far , far superior in every aspect . I believe next year the makers of P2 games will finally use the potential of the system but for today they are not . So with that said if you want to play basketball go get NBA2K1 and leave NBA Live 2001 on the store shelves .	-1
I decided to rent this game upon discovering kiss would hardly be in it.Well i must say , with other dc shooters out there , Kiss Psycho Circus really does n't give you a single reason to buy it above the rest.It has the basic search for key , shoot a stupid looking enemy , where 's a bigger gun element you 'd expect , and cant pull it off that well.I do n't know why but i really was n't feeling the level design of this game.Why cant i run around in an abondoned carnival blasting carnies ? That would 've been cool.In it 's defense , it does have some pretty impressive visuals and some cool looking baddies for you to hack up , but since the gameplay sort of fails , so does this game.There 's no internet multiplayer , that didnt bother me at all really.BUT what did was the fact that there is NO multiplayer of any kind.That 's right , no deathmatch.As it stands , this game warrants a rent if it looks attractive to you but there 's better out there .	-1
Alone In the Dark 4 : The New Nightmare is actually only rated so low because of how amazingly similar it is to Capcom 's classic Resident Evil 2 . Not just a slight similarity either , but rather strikingly identical . Let 's see , a man and woman both forced into a creepy location . Check . They both discover unusual and unexplainable monsters . Check . They both communicate through a radio . Check . They both go around searching for clues to understand the oddness around them . Check . Preset camera angles that made the classic RE series popular on the Playstation . Check.You see , this is basically a continuation of Resident Evil 2 . Maybe , and this is perhaps a really big stretch , this game would appeal to those who did n't think RE2 was anything to write home about . However Alone in the Dark 4 : The New Nightmare is such a blatant imitation of what I consider the real thing that it 's hard for me to approach it with open arms and accept it knowing what Resident Evil 2 is a better accomplishment.As for the enemies , the dogs look exactly like dobermans from the RE series , monsters that resemble the slow-paced movements of zombies from the RE series that creep around hallway corners in a similar fashion , and monsters that resemble drain deimos from ... you can probably guess by this point , the RE series ! Impossible to believe such a clear ripoff managed to make it to the store shelves . In a way the soundtrack resembles Silent Hill in the creepiness and even surpasses the Resident Evil series in the freak-out department , but otherwise just stick with Resident Evil 2 for the best survival horror experience . It 's like Resident Evil with way less action and more focus on the atmosphere and storyline .	-1
Although I rather like the game and really enjoy the graphics and music of it , I now wish I had n't purchased it at all . The game is rather buggy . It has a tendency to crash when you attempt to skip dialogue , and sometimes key items simply do not work . One of the online faqs I read explained in detail that sometimes an item simply wo n't work as it is supposed to , and in such a case , you basically have to start all over . Restarting your PSX/PS2 wo n't fix the problem . I had that happen 3 hours into the game with the library keys . What a waste of time . Good game ; lousy quality control .	-1
I will admit that I had not played this format of a game before . However , I find it extremely difficult and frustrating .	-1
The original Alone in the Dark game was truly innovative and set many technological landmarks for other PC games of the day . Oh how far we have strayed . This game uses the Nocturne engine and , like every previous game that has used the Nocturne engine , the end result is washed out graphics , horribly awkward camera angles , bad movement control , and the joy of having to fight offscreen creatures that you ca n't see unless you run to a different area . I can only imagine that the Nocturne engine is [ inexpensive ] to license .	-1
Just a warning for those that are n't familiar with the Alone in the Dark series that they may want to try the demo first . The reason being I tried the demo and have never been more unimpressed by a game hyped such as this.Fans of the Alone in the Dark series might find the sequel entertaining but some of my gripes with the demo - ( And keep in mind it was the demo so I ca n't give you an idea on the entire game , but like I said , the demo made me determined not to buy the game . ) -- The perspective is constantly switched . In other words , in one scene , you are looking at the front of the character , when he moves to another area ( zone ) that is downloaded , you are looking at him from the side , etc ... Each small area ( zone ) has to be downloaded and the viewing perspective constantly changes which is very annoying. -- The mouse did n't work . At least on the demo . It was keyboard only. -- Great FX on the character , but the scenery ( especially the pouring rain ) was TERRIBLE . It was a giant clash comparing this beautifully , lifelike character with some aspects that looked like the old CGA graphics. -- The gameplay system was very cumbersome . It was n't managed to give you a smooth flow when you are switching items , etc..With lack of a better way to explain it , the game reminded me of an 80 's game . For instance , the downloading of every small parcel of land ( zone ) as opposed to smooth flowing through the entire area like ALL games today . And as far as the horror/spooky theme , it was very cheesy . I would recommend Clive Barker 's Undying as a game that is everything this one attempted to be .	-1
Am I the only fan of the first 2 games that does n't like this one ? C'mon , underneath the funny intro , the vastly improved graphics and sound and the overall presentaition of the game , is there really a game that lives up to the first 2 ? I would have to say no.The graphics , as good as they are , are way too cartoony . The jokes ( aside from the intro ) are either not funny or are non-existent . The puzzles are almost all really obscure . The plot is incredibly cliched ( save the governer - AGAIN ) . I ca n't help but feel that had this been released almost immediately after LeChuck 's Revenge with the same graphics and sound that it would be scorned apon compared to the other two.Generally , I do n't find this at all fun to play . Adventure games are one of the few genres where older games are still good for the simple reason that they do n't need superb graphics or the latest technology . They need good puzzles and a good plot . They need you to get engaged in the characters . Just check out the first two games and ignore the lack of technology - they are much better . My favourite adventure game though would still have to be Full Throttle . Now THERE 'S a game .	-1
Outlaws is a first person shooter set in the wild west . The story line is you play the hero and have to rescue your daughter from the villan . Built on a outdated engine with wonky physics , Dated graphics and a 2.5D design . Very dull gameplay with no atmosphere and a box of rocks AI . Gameplay is nothing but shoot the baddies , Find key , Open door , Shoot more baddies , Find another Key ect ect . Outlaws is very dissapointing .	-1
I purchased this game after reading a recent article about the best games of the 90 's . This may have been a great game then , but it does n't stand the test of time . It may be fun for those who played the game when it originally was released , but it has little value for new gamers .	-1
I picked this up in a bargain bin because I had heard great things about Grim Fandango , now an admittedly older title . I had also played a demo of one of the Monkey Island games and found it hilarious . I greedily slapped down my ten bucks and looked forward to some fun.The game is fun to listen to and watch . Filled with yucks aplenty , Grim Fandango is like participating directly in a wacky animated film . For this alone , Fandango earns high praise . As with the Monkey Island games , the voice acting and humor is top notch.Sadly , gameplay suffers . If you read through enough reviews here at Amazon , you 'll find that people like Fandango simply for its humor and style ; most customers admit that they needed walkthroughts to get past the game 's frustrating puzzles . I 'm a puzzle fan , and I like a challenge , but there were simply too many moments in Fandango where the puzzles felt arbitrary . Logic rarely led to a solution ; only trial and error did ! For me , this weighed heavily -- and I mean heavily -- against the game . Humor and style , huge plusses no doubt , should still be secondary to gameplay ( or at least equal ) . With Fandango , gameplay seems to be a less important means towards creative and hilarious ends . You 'll need to decide if this is okay with you . For me , it wasn't.For music reviews , visit [ ... ]	-1
Nice Game But i was expecting A lot more ... Dont expect Much	-1
Red Faction is a futuristic first person shooter set in mars . You play parker a miner in mars who fight against his employers . The game loads data and runs great , The graphics and sound are ok but the geo-mod technology is not as good as they said . The single player is very disappointing . It is a fairly long game but the gameplay is dull because of the poor level design , dumb ai and nothing new . It is not very hard but the designers do n't know where the player would run out of ammo or health . Red Faction is very disappointing .	-1
they never made a mac version of collector 's .	-1
I played the demo of this game , and quickly realised that I would not be paying for the full version.I think it 's a reflection of the game that used versions are currently selling at very low money , and it is a real shame , when this game COULD have been a winner.You are a secret agent type assassin given several tasks that involve thinking and sneaking around , instead of the usual guns blazing approach , and the graphics , levels , enemies , weapons , and scenarios are actually very very good . There is ONE big problem however , you CA N'T SAVE your progress as you go . Even if you play this game on the easiest level , you will find it very frustrating . There is a fine line between a game that is n't easy to beat , and one that 's annoying as anything , and this one jumps that line with size 12 boots . You will find yourself playing for a long time , reaching so far in a level and then getting killed off , only to go back and start from scratch . I hope the programmers have learned from their mistakes as I see a sequel is now available . If you really like this kind of game , try & quot ; Soldier of Fortune & quot ; instead , it 's much more rewarding .	-1
'Project IGI ' is a cross between 'Goldeneye ' , 'Metal Gear Solid ' and 'Delta Force ' . As an ex-SAS , ex joyrider called David Llewelyn Jones ( despite the name , he does n't appear to be Welsh ) you run around a series of modern battlefields , infiltrating installations , avoiding cameras and shooting things . In very nice 3D , with some huge landscapes that you can explore , if you feel like it . Like 'Delta Force ' , it 's weighted towards action , and although a few well-placed shots finish off the bad guys , you are slightly less mortal . Nonetheless , you can be stealthy , and quite often it 's much easier to avoid tripping the alarms ( which you can turn off - best of all , you can just shoot the cameras ) . The graphics are attractive , if a little sparce . As in the song by The Who , you can see for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles , and some of the detail is superb - your weapons look and sound authentic , the explosions and ricocheting bullets are alarming , and you ca n't hide behind impenetrable cardboard boxes , because they are n't . After a while you notice that the graphics are sometimes quite spartan , and although the textures are high-quality , the interiors are often extremely bland . As with 'Delta Force ' , the bad guys seem to have built their bases from mass-produced kits , as individual buildings are copied and pasted verbatim from mission to mission , with only the furniture moved around to differentiate . There 's some excellent modern James Bond-esque music , and the game itself is often extremely good fun - like 'Delta Force ' , but done well . But not that well . The plot tries for a James Bond ambience , but even with only 14 missions our hero seems to spend a lot of time escaping , being caught , and escaping again . The voice acting is very bad , too - our hero sounds like an enthusiastic primary school teacher , whilst his lovely assistant Anya has a California valley-girl accent that seems more Playboy bunny than government employee . I kept expecting her to use the word doofus , but she does n't . Meanwhile , the supposedly Eastern European guards shout 'Hey you ' and 'Stop ' in English . The morality seems a bit iffy , too - you 're basically a hired killer , and the bad guys are n't really bad guys , they 're just guards in foreign , but non-hostile , military bases . It 's as if you were a French soldier set down in Scotland , shooting down Scottish security guards . And yet , these are minor things . There are three major points that bedevil it - you ca n't save during a mission , at all ; the missions are highly linear and scripted , in such a way that you absolutely have to play the mission several times over before you can complete it ; and it 's just not big enough . The decision not to include the ability to save a game is a brave one , shared with 'Aliens vs Predator ' . The idea is to increase the tension by not allowing you to chicken out and hit F6 to quicksave , as with most other first-person shooters since 'Doom ' ( it 's hard to remember nowadays , but until 'Doom ' action games rarely let you save ) . It does n't really work in 'Project IGI ' - the size of some of the later missions , coupled with the fact that death is sometimes instant and unexpected , make it highly irritating . 'AvP ' was eventually patched so that you could save a maximum of three times during a mission - a much better system . And the scripting is highly annoying . This is one of those games where you can explore an area and find it free of baddies but , if you press a switch , talk to somebody , or step over an invisible boundary , suddenly a truck-full of soldiers materialises from thin air . You can never really predict or guard against this , and quite often the missions become memory tests . One mission in which you have to escort a Russian businessman is particularly frustrating , and more than once I felt like burning the CD and posting it back to Eidos with a nasty letter . In general , the bits where you have to escort people ( thankfully , only twice does this horrible game element appear ) are dreadful - you have no way of knowing where they are , and they usually just stand there , waiting to be shot . And worst of all , it 's too small . It has no fewer missions than 'Hidden and Dangerous ' , but a handful of them are extremely easy , and you 'll finish them in no time . There is absolutely no replay value , either - the linear missions mean that once you 've completed them , there 's nothing to see if you play them again . And there 's no multiplayer option at all . Fourteen missions and that 's your lot . You 'll play it for two or three days , get annoyed during the final , immensely frustrating , mission , and never play it ever again .	-1
The basic idea behind the game sounds fun . You 're an SAS officer , sent off on a number of missions to save the world . It 's a standard FPS shooter , made a bit more exiting by the 3D landscape engine which allows the action to take place across large outdoor environments.The emphasis is on & quot ; real-world & quot ; fighting - where taking a couple of shots will kill you , and so you spend most of the time creeping around hoping not to be discovered.There are plenty of gadgets to play with too . The Satelite camera allows you to view the action around you from above , and zoom in on activity in outdoor areas . When you use the camera , the map is shown full-screen and the action caries on around you in & quot ; real-time & quot ; . If you 're not careful you can get killed while looking at the map.This & quot ; real-world & quot ; emphasis can be great ( try games like SWAT3 ) , but the game designers need to finely balance & quot ; reality & quot ; with & quot ; fun & quot ; . Unfortunately this is where Project IGI shoots itself in the foot ( as it were ) .I couldnt even get past the first level on & quot ; normal & quot ; difficulty . I 'm not that bad at games ( I 've completed Half-life , Star Trek Elite Force etc . ) , but try as I might I couldnt get through the first mission . I 'd get 5 minutes into the level and get shot by a sniper - there 's no save game feature , so you have to go back to the start of the level . A boring 5 minutes spent working through the part of the level I 'd already completed , shoot the sniper ... and then got shot by someone else . Guess what ? Another 5 minutes going back over the exact same level again ! After I 'd played through the same part of the same level 10 times I just got bored and went to play something more fun instead.As far as the rest of the game goes , other than the outdoor maps , there is very little special about the graphics - they 're pretty much Quake2 engine standard ( sub Half-Life ) . All that running around , climbing ladders etc . is pretty passe these days ( how old is Tomb Raider ? ) , and there is really nothing new that this game does.I originally bought the game because PCGamer UK gave it a good review . As it stands , without a save game feature , I wouldnt recommend it to anyone . If Eidos get around to patching the game ( there 's no sign of it yet ) , and adding the ability to save your progress within a mission I might start playing it again . As it stands , I 'll stick with SWAT3 Elite Edition ... & quot ; The element is behind you ! & quot ; or Counterstrike.Pro : 1 . The satelite camera is quite cool . 2 . Outdoor environments make a change from usual FPS.Con 1 . You cant save your game . 2 . Too easy on & quot ; easy & quot ; . 3 . Impossible on any difficulty setting above & quot ; easy & quot ; ( partly because there is no save game option ) . 4 . No multiplayer . 5 . Dodgy voice acting .	-1
You heard right , this game has no SaveGame . It 'saves ' only at the end of each of the 13 levels . The levels are huge , and 1 shot can kill you , or raising the alarm , or 50 other things . They say it 's for realism , truth is that Eidos wanted this game out by Xmas . Unless you like being very frustrated , and repeating a level from the start time after time after time , buy something else . If you played SOF on hard setting all the way through without saving , go ahead and get IGI , otherwise you 'll have to play this game w/it 's 'trainer ' . It 's a hack that gives you unlimited health , but that takes alot of fun out . Design is monotonous with only 10 buildings that just repeat level after level . So overall , close but no cigar . This COULD have been a cool game w/a savegame and more levels , but it 's not . Try NoOneLivesForever or something else AT LEAST until Eidos offers a savegame patch . This game is 95 % SOF ( great game ) , and 5 % cool , new ideas like cameras , alarms , real weapons , but without varied design & amp ; all ruined by an unforgiveable mistake . Save your money .	-1
This is a game only for members of the Tomb Raider Fanatics Club . If you remove all the hyperbole and wishful thinking . This game is just another rehash of the older , CHEAPER , Tomb Raider titles.Sure , you have new weapons and some new moves but it all adds up to the same thing : A big yawn ! The game 's clipping problems and crazy camera angles made things even worse . People who gave this game a good review must have been in a very magnanimus mood , or they must really enjoy ogling Lara Croft 's enormous & quot ; guns & quot ; .It 's time for Eidos to stop milking this cash cow and deliver something different to the gaming public .	-1
This game is n't as good as most of the 1st person shooters on the PS1 . For a release on the PS2 this is a pathetic excuse . You 'd be better off buying Syphon Filter 1 or 2 , or Medal of Honor for the PS1 , or waiting for new versions of those games to come out on the PS2 .	-1
This game is different for a First Person Shooter ... quite a bit different concept that most games , but is too difficult to control .	-1
Although a decent FPS , it fails in comparison to the N64 titles that have dominated the console FPS market , Goldeneye and Perfect Dark . Do n't expect too much and you wo n't be too disappointed .	-1
The control of this game is awful . Graphics are average , sound below average and did i mention the horrible contols ? Pass on this one and find a better FPS there are several out there .	-1
Is this PS2 graphics or just taken from the original PS ? The graphics are for the most part dated and very weak looking and the game is only semi-fun if you play the multiplayer death matches . Personaly I prefer Unreal Tournament for PS2 . If you want to buy this game at least rent it first , or if not , it 's your funeral .	-1
Maybe it is just me , but I feel that WWF No Mercy is the one that most appeals to a limited crowd . From what I see , it 's either you enjoy wrestling and love this game , or you hate/could n't care less about wrestling and you do n't . I happen to be in the latter category , and so I feel that there is nothing about this game that I really enjoy . I really do n't think there are anything in this game that would appeal to other non-wrestling-fans except for the fact that it is easy to pick up and play . Being a non-wrestling fan , I do n't really understand what exactly the crowd meter thingy is for . You could be beating the life out of the opposing wrestler , yet your relation with the crowd is relatively low . I highly doubt that any other non-wrestling-fans would know what it is either.That is not to say that there is nothing fun about this game . As I said , the game is very easy to pick up and play . After a few rounds of button mashing , you would be able to figure out that A is to grapple and do whatever other attacks you have , and B is to just beat the living crud out of each and every one of your opponents . Yet if you are not familiar with how to end a match , then you 'll likely just attack for a while until your opponent gets seriously bloody . Constantly pressing B just to turn your opponent into a bloody mess gets old if you keep on doing it for several minutes . And controlling characters on a semi-3D environment just does not feel natural . Sure , I do n't mind the fact that the game keeps you locked onto an opponent at all times , but it is moving around that gets tedious.WWF No Mercy was probably the most realistic wrestling game back in 2000 . There are authentic entrances with authentic entrance music as well as authentic game modes . Yet to be completely honest , I do n't really care . The graphics are more gritty and realistic than Asmik Ace and Aki 's previous two wrestling games ( 1998 's WCW/nWo Revenge and 1999 's WWF Wrestlemania 2000 ) , and the characters models do n't look like faces painted on blobs like earler wrestling games . In other words , they actually look like people this time around . However , they still do n't look very good . Stephanie McMahon looks like a zombie , or somebody really ugly wearing a lot of makeup . Crowds are no better than previous Asmik Ace/AKI wrestling games . They do n't look like cardboard anymore , but they are just really ugly , really pixelated sprites instead . Sound effects are a bit laughable . It 's just `` BOOM ! KAPAM KAPOW ! '' Yeah . It 's not that I have anything against this game , but I just do n't find it that good . It still is the best of the Asmik Ace/Aki wrestling games . Maybe I would appreciate it more if I actually watch wrestling . Hey , at least from the critical success , it establishes the Nintendo 64 as the premiere system for wrestling . That is something to be proud of .	-1
no mercy has got to be the worst wwf game i have ever played . for one thing no mercy does not have special entrances like wrestlemania 2000 does . in no mercy the titantron does not play when you make your entrance . also in no mercy every tag team comes out seperately and you have to buy everything from the smackdown mall and where 's the fun in that ? also the box says up to 10 backstage areas and there are only six . in conclusion smackdown 2 is the better buy .	-1
Let me get to it : The wrestling engine , player lineup and create-a-wrestler are the most amazing things I 've seen and are what make this game ( except for 3-way or 4-way , because selecting which wrestler you are fightins is really annoying and those matches go FOREVER ) .The thing I do n't get is what 's with the career mode ? It is simply the most infuriating thing I 've ever seen . You have to sit through all the matches on your `` TV Show '' or `` PPV '' ( of course , you can skip them , but that takes 2 minutes a pop , JUST TO SKIP ! ) , and your wrestler is n't even always on ! Why do I have to sit through 7 matches that I 'm not even playing in . SOOOOO BORING ! Also , the cut scenes are an embarassment . There 's like 5 different ones , and they take so long to load they are not even remotely worth it any shape or form.Hopefully Smackdown 3 will solve these problems . If you have a bunch of friends and want to play this , get it , but if you want to entertain yourself , I 'd wait .	-1
This game is cool , but could 've been better . It 's much better than Wrestlemania 2000 on N64 . However , the gameplay is way too fast , and the Season mode takes way too long . Buy Smackdown on Playstation 2 .	-1
Thank goodness that I rented this game . This game is much better than the first Smackdown game . The create a superstar feature in SD1 was a joke . The create a superstar in SD2 is bigger and more extensive . There are still major problems . 1 ) The color option graphs are difficult to use . You only see the colors change as you scroll through the graphs . Then you 'll have to right down the number value for each color you chose for future use . 2 ) Once you 've chozen and saved certain features , you can NOT change them . I made three characters . Each one took about 45 minutes to make , including moves . After a few hours of gameplay , I wanted to change the characters names and/or entrances . This can NOT be done . The only way is to completely re-make the wrestler all over again . If you did n't wright your information down , it will be another 45 minutes out of your life . As far as the wrestling matches , Smackdown 2 offers many fun options . Table , Casket , Ladder , Hell in the Cell . However , the big draw of SD1 and SD2 is supposed to be the career modes . The career mode in SD2 is actually WORSE than the first . I ca n't understand why a player has to sit through wrestling dates that do n't feature the player on the card . You can skip the matches , but this takes time . You WILL have to watch the all too brief cut scenes . After 5 dates of inactivity , I used a cheat process to make myself number 1 contender for the Light Heavyweight title . I finally got to play . I , nor my other creations , were ever asked a question by a WWF superstar . They were n't part of the story lines . In the FIVE days that I rented the game , I only saw 1 of my guys in ONE cut scene . This is ridiculous . A personal grief I have over SD2 is the inability of female wrestlers ( other than Chyna ) to go for WWF titles other than the Woman 's Championship . I do n't know if this was a decision by THQ or the WWF or both . I feel ladies should be able to at least compete for the Tag and LH belts . There is only one major flaw with gameplay . In matches where there is more than one opponent , the player has to manually change the focus of which wrestler he wants to attack . This can get very confusing . A player can wind up punching in the wrong direction or attack his own Tag partner . That 's my review . I enjoyed my rental time , but I would n't pay money to own this game . If you do n't already have it , and you do n't mind the old talent line up , I recommend buying & quot ; WWF Attitude. & quot ; If you have an N64 , I recommend & quot ; WWF Wrestmania 2000 & quot ; over & quot ; WWF No Mercy. & quot ; Read those reviews to learn why .	-1
Compared to WWF No Mercy , or even WCW NWO Revenge , THQ have gone a big step down for these playstation versions.First off , the controls are stupid , on the N64 they are easy , and you know what you are doing , on the playstation they are confusing and plays more like an arcade beat 'em up then a wrestling match . And I really hate the way you do specials in this game.The Create A Wrestler was the first thing I tried out , it 's ok , but too confusing , the lists are too long and numbered instead of telling you what it is . I could n't even find a DX shirt to put on . The music is pointless as it only shows about 5 seconds of the titantron before it cuts to the next bit , I could n't even find half of my fave . moves , yet there in the game somewhere and you ca n't even pick a height , you just have tall or short instead of the actual stat.But what really bugged me about this game is season mode . It 's confusing to even start one , but it is frustrating to have to have to go through every match of the show either watching it or simulating it , i try to skip them all to the match i 'm in , but it takes too long with annoying music and then takes longer to load a pointless scene saying , `` whoever , had entered the building '' ... big deal , why did they do this ? why not just do what has been done with the other 64 games and just go from your matches next to next instead of wasting your time having to simulate every other match , with no way to skip ALL events till your match , or have you spend about 10 minutes simulating through a show that you 're character is not even participating in.this game hit rock bottom and laid the smackdown on nothing but itself . Play the N64 versions cause these games are not down with it and thats the bottom line cause I said so .	-1
While the lastest and greatest wrestling game for playstation is much improved , it may be just a little too advanced for playstation , as it seems all you do is look at pictures of your favorite wrestlers while the graphics are constantly loading . Once you actually get into the matches though , the game play is pretty fun , with all the special moves of each wrestler . There is a need for commentary from the real announcers to give this game a more realistic feel . Overall a game that I ca n't wait to see on Playstation2 , because all the loading time wo n't be there anymore .	-1
Well the game is good ... .. lots of players ... .but here are some cons ... ... ... ... lots of them ... ..1 ) They walk like girls.2 ) The weapons dont do anything.3 ) They dont bleed . After all the beatings.4 ) If you fall of the top rope or the hell in the cell . They will get right back up . with out any damage.5 ) The season is soooo boaring ... .. my cousins fell a sleep , when i was playing it.6 ) Every time when micel cole interviews some one , after the interview he will srug like he has no idea of what the hell is going on.AND I COULD GO ON ... ... ... ... ... ..BUT LETS STOP ... ... ... .CAUSE I AM TIERD OF TELLING THE TRUTH TO THE WORLD AND SAVING PEOPLE FROM THIS CRAP ... ... UR WELLCOME . : - )	-1
Rockstar , the developers of this awful game , sure have been pumping out the PS2 games . Smuggler 's Run was fun and all , but this is just too bad . It fails in every way that a game can . The visuals are sub-par ( PSOne games look 10x better than this ) , it controls like a cow , and the actual gameplay is repetitive and a chore to play . Not worth your time .	-1
Before Bungie made Halo ( the most overrated game of all time , aside from Grand Theft Auto : Vice City ) , they proved that they most definitely were NOT the `` greatest developers of all time '' ( as any ignorant XBOX fanboy will tell you ) with this little-known blunder of a Third-person-shooter/fighter . Little known for a good reason , it seems.This is one of the most aggravating games I 've played in a long time . Not the `` good '' type of aggravating that you get from playing a game like Contra , where it 's fun as hell , even if you die ( and which results in that ultimate feeling of `` awesome '' when you finally DO beat it ) . Oni is the type of aggravating where 75 % of the frustration and difficulty comes from the game itself , not because you are n't good at it.Games like Oni are why I have very little respect for most American developers . `` Hey guys , I have an idea ! Let 's forget about making a game that 's actually FUN , Let 's concentrate instead on making a game as realistic as possible . SO realistic in fact , that it greatly hinders the gameplay , and defeats the main purpose of playing a video game ! Oh sure , some people may say it 's boring , but who cares ? They 'll be too blown away by the fact that the game is just like real life ! `` That forumla does not work at all in making a good game . Let 's list the reasons why : -The movement controls are designed to be like a first person shooter , with the left stick for movement , and the right stick for turning . That would be cool if this was a first person shooter . But in a third person game with much faster action ( not to mention jumping and fighting game moves too ) , this just becomes ridiculous . People with less than 4 hands will find this game 's controls poorly designed and nearly impossible to master.-You can only carry one weapon at a time . How lame is that ? Some may say this makes it more strategic , but take a look at Half-Life : You can carry as many weapons as you want , and it 's still full of strategy.-Hypo Sprays , the game 's way of recovering your health , do n't have an immediate effect . Instead of having your health meter instantly rise to full , it sloooooooooowly works it 's way up to the top of the meter . If you get attacked while you 're recovering , you 've lost it all . Bye bye.-There 's no block button . Blocking attacks supposedly occurs when you face the enemy and do n't press anything , but 9 out of 10 times , this wo n't save your ass.-The game goes WAAAAAY overboard with weapon limitations . The Mecury Bow , for instance , has a 5 second recharge time and fires a whopping ... 2 rounds before it 's out of ammo . Even though it kills most enemies in one hit , it still is n't enough to justifysomething like that.-You can only jump from about 10 feet off the ground before you take damage from falling . Once again , this is just going way overboard.-You have to press a button to pick up items on the ground instead of just walking into the item and getting it . Need I say more ? -There 's a HUGE gun in the game which one of the bosses weilds . Once you beat him , you can use this weapon for yourself . The problem is , you ( literally ! ) can only run about 1 mile an hour while you 're wielding this thing . It makes getting from one end of a hall to the other feel like a drive across the country.There are some good things about Oni , like the good voice acting , the stylish cel-shaded graphics , and the comic book feel of the game , but it 's overshadowed by all the horribly annoying gameplay flaws . Not worth it .	-1
Graphics are terrible , the controls are clunky as hell , but it does have an anime opening . That being said , that 's like the only good thing about it . Not to mention that the plot is a blatant ripoff of Ghost in the Shell .	-1
I enjoy playing these old titles sometimes you find a gem you skipped over , and sometimes you find a turd . This game is a turd.Remember the earlier days of gaming when the box cover was usually more exciting than the game itself ? Well it 's pretty much the same thing here.Hands down the most incredibly difficult game you will probably ever have the opportune chance of playing . Nearly impossible to beat thanks to the games mechanics . You 'll at times feel like your trying to take down a tank with a sling shot with the powerless weapon selection they provide you.The controls are n't that great but they are n't that bad . This is the first time I had to use a cheat code to survive in a game since Duke Nukem ... and I mean the original side scroller version . This game is inhumanely difficult . You 'll have 2-3 guys attacking you at once . While one is shooting with 100 % marksman ship just draining your life away the other ( s ) will be kicking and punching you and knocking you down . So your getting both beat and shot to death . Sounds like it would be rare but it is n't . This happens 100 % of the time when you have one armed and one unarmed opponent mix . Each armed gooned you come across is almost like a mini boss . Your guns will barely phase them while they 're guns hit every mark and will kill you even if you jump and run around or try to see cover.Very poor game mechanics , and pretty inconsistent game play . The music is mundane and the artwork switches from fantastic to what is this supposed to be . Might not matter but in an `` anime '' game what 's the reason for having several different artist with multiple renderings of the same character that look different in each one ? Sounds like I 'm being harsh but I just expected the in game art to look as good as the front cover and the opening scene . Instead it goes from Madhouse to Crayola crayon .	-1
The previews looked so cool . Get this , you need a TUTORIAL TO WALK . Yes , walking is a pain . WHenever you go sideways you actually strafe sideways , it is really inconvienient . The controls are terrible . You will see what I mean when you get to the first part of the training . You have to run around a room in an extremely short time . I had to do it like 8 times . Basically to beat it I walked straight , strafed left , then went backwards , and narrowly got it . Then the combos , they are so difficult to pull off . I honestly feel that the creators were trying to make it as hard as possible to lash out against the society or something.The backgrounds are terrible . I rented this game for one day and was fed up with it after 5 minutes of the first level . You honestly are going to see alot of boxes , in some of the most uninspired and retarted rooms ever . One room was a square . O thats right , they are all squares , with 2 or 3 boxes of course . Ca n't forget those boxes.The guns are the worst actually . When you shoot 6 bullets with a gun , mabye 5 , your girl looks at the roof . She can not hold a gun straight . The target practice is basically 3 targets going directly upward . I mean seriously , this chick is an operative , and the recoil on her gun actually has her looking towards the roof in 6 shots or less . O but wait , lets say she walks while she shoots , now magically her gun has no recoil and she is fine . So whenever you want to shoot anything and actually hit it with 2 shots or more , you have to move around . Want to know something else ? The guns are stupid.The combos are hard to pull off , and worthless . I could care less about snapping that guy , I only have 2 arms . Jeez , it 's like memorizing the dictionary , then repeating it word for word with the same exact tone and depth that you memorized it with.The game is terrible . Spend no money on it . Rockstar must of been payed to stop making this game , because I never see it anywhere , and that is a GOOD thing .	-1
The Good : Nice anime cut scenes , lots of levels , smooth combat animationsThe Bad : Clumsy and cumbersome controls , boring levels , lame objectives , no mid-level save , unfair checkpoint placement , flat ugly texturesOni was a very hyped anime style game back in the day . This game was made by Rockstar before getting into the 3D Grand Theft Autos and other games . This game has a lot of potential , but is flawed in a lot of ways that make the game more boring and frustrating than bad . With that said , the only redeeming quality are the good-looking combat animations and challenge.Right out of the gate you will notice that the controls are completely upside and backwards . All the combat moves are on the shoulder buttons . Why in the world they thought of this is beyond me . You actually do n't really use the face buttons all that much . This make jumping , fighting , and shooting clumsy and cumbersome and you ca n't change the controls to something more natural . These are just some of the worst action/adventure controls I have ever used . The actual combat is fine , but executing these moves is a pain . I felt like I was stumbling over myself because I had to think about the controls . These just are n't natural ! Jumping with R1 , L2 and L1 are kick and punch , and you pick up items with R3 . What ? ! I felt like I was trying to solve a Rubix cube , not play a game.Secondly is the exploration factor . The levels are boring . They all look pretty much the same with flat boring textures and the design is confusing and labyrinthine in some levels . There 's no direction and your compass is useless . The bar gets smaller as you get near an objective , but if you are two flights down it will act like you 're standing right next to it . Enemies are stupid and clumsy , boss fights are frustrating , and the game just ca n't compensate its own design with the clumsy controls . I ca n't tell you how tired I got after just three levels of finding this colored console to open same colored door over and over again.The story is n't really worth sticking around the 14 levels either . The anime cut scenes are nice , but you probably wo n't even get through this slog of a game . I tried really hard to keep going , but there was never a change in pace . It did n't help that there is no mid-level saving and the checkpoint placement is unfair . If you quit in the middle of a level you have to start all over . There are just a lot of annoying things with this game , but even if it was flawless you still have the fact that the game is just boring and not very fun.When it is all said and done only the hardest core of anime fans will stick around until the end . You really had to have played this when it first came out , then come back for nostalgic purposes . The game is just clumsy and boring , but has so much potential if only the developers spent more time on the game . As is stand , I really ca n't recommend this to anyone .	-1
This is the worst PS2 game I have ever played . Boring , repetitive backgrounds , uninteresting weapons and characters , awkward control scheme , all on one disk . I bought this game used a while ago for $ 12.00 and I still feel ripped off.Did I mention the graphics ? This game was released close to the time of the PS2 launch , and it shows . There are also some serious clipping issues.Simply put : Oni is n't worth your time .	-1
I only just got the game from the playstation store and holy crap do i regret wasting $ 10 bucks on it ... its so difficult it makes ninja gaiden on nes and battletoads on nes look easy by comparison . The graphics are decent for a PS1 era game , but the voice acting in generally is really bad . if only this game was easier it might be fun , buts its not easy or much fun either . nows when the ability to get refunds for digitally downloaded games would come in handy ... even if your a persona fan like iam , your better off avoiding this game . i might do a better review of persona 2 eternal punishment if i ever get farther then 3 battles without dying like i did really fast	-1
The problem with the 2-D shooter genre is that it 's very easy for developers to turn out weak , uninspired drek that will still sell well to a niche market ; shooters are n't nearly as popular as they used to be and fans will snatch up the new ones with little hesitation . Sadly , I was one of them.Gunbird 2 plays looks and plays almost exactly like Strikers 1945 on the Sony PlayStation , and believe you me , that is NOT a good thing . The graphics look horribly dated ... I know a great game does not require eye-melting visuals , but come ON . Systems less powerful than the Dreamcast consistenly produced games that looked far more impressive than this . Capcom 's insertion of characters from their more well-known games does nothing to increase Gunbird 2 's appeal . There 's precious little depth to the gameplay , as well . The stages are very short and you get from one end to the other simply by using your special attacks at every opportunity and continuing as many times as you need to . There comes a point where continuing will send you back to the beginning of the stage , but instead of making you more determined to beat the game , it just annoys you.It seems that most shooters are really good or really bad . There 's Einhander , there 's G Darius , and then there 's ... this . Life is too short to waste playing bad shooters !	-1
I love the first Power Stone . It 's the best Dreamcast game in my opinion . And I 'm also a big fan of the anime based on it . I never got to play Power Stone 2 until I got Power Stone Collection for the PSP , and I was REALLY looking forward to it , but it did n't meet my expectations at all . True , it did have some good ideas , but they were all so poorly executed ! And do n't tell me `` Oh ! But this one has a 4 player mode ! '' . Who cares ? That does n't make it good . Plus this 4 player mode is nothing but a huge , disjointed mess ! And then there 's the new characters . These new characters are so boring and stupid . I do n't even know where to start ! Another thing is the announcer . He is SO ANNOYING . He says irritating things like `` This does n't look good ! You better be careful ! '' . No really ? You think so , moron ? Why do n't you be a little bit more useful ! But in conclusion , to sum it all up in a nutshell : The first game was a revolutionary and original concept for the fighting game genre and it was alot of fun to play . The sequel was nothing but a cash-in attempt that relied on style over substance and quantity over quality , and it 's worth about $ 60 used ? Glad I do n't have to buy this abomination twice since I despise it so much . There 's several other things I 'd rather spend $ 60 on ! And not just video games either . The original game is worth playing without question , but this sequel is nothing but a waste of time . It belongs in the same group of sequels as ones like Megaman X6 , Marvel vs. Capcom 3 , Contra Force , Double Dragon III : The Sacred Stones , Final Fight Streetwise , Duke Nukem Forever , and any other sequel like those I just listed . Oh and by the way , none of the characters in Power Stone 2 have any endings either . They just escape from the castle , and you get a credit sequence . BOOOO-RIIIIIIIIIING .	-1
If you like Resident Evil , or First Person Shooters , this is not the game for you . This one fails horribly on both fronts . There is no look around feature essential to any FPS , so you can be standing right in front of something , and not be able to see it because you ca n't look down ! Not to mention the fact that the plot is weak , and has nothing to do with the continuity of the other games . Steer clear of this one at all costs .	-1
Let me begin this review by telling you that if you are going to start this game , prepare yourself to finish it . Put on some nachos or grab a large drink because there are no save points . The game follows the classic RE storyline , but adds a twist . This is a nice game to obtain if you are not digging the new plot-deviation of RE4 , 5 , and 6 . Also good to complete your collection in the same vein as Umbrella Conspiracies . So , on to the game itself ... The game will take you anywhere between 1 and 3 hours to complete . Any longer and you should be checking your pulse . I was getting tired of not being able to save , mainly out of boredom , but I toughed it out anyways . My first time through I played lazily and ended up with a B ranking and 2:32 something . I have no intentions of improving on my rank , as the only interesting part is starting the game over with all the weapons you acquired in the previous run-through . A quick read through ( or follow-along ) with this guide : [ ... ] will help you get through the game very fast . It 's so short that you can print it on one page.________________________________My pros : * First-person shooter perspective adds a whole new element to the series , and actually is very scary . I yipped more than once when the dogs jumped up at me or the hunters were lunging at my face . * The game follows classic RE style but with a twist in the story line that somehow still folds together.My cons : * Voice acting is BAD . I mean original RE bad . Maybe even worse . It 's just gross ! * Graphics are a suckfest . Blocky , ugly , sketchy ... REDC , RE2 , and RE3 all look better on my TV . * ZERO replay value . Like renting a movie you only watch once . I heard there was a rocket launcher to obtain but that 's too easy . Give me an alternate character or alternate story line instead ! * Disgusting side story . Why the developers thought they needed to concoct a story that involves abducting pre-teen children and cutting open their skulls for extraction of pituitary brain matter for Tyrant growth is beyond my comprehension . Disturbing at best , distasteful at worst.________________________________Get this game if you are really a die-hard . Otherwise you 'll be better of skipping this one - and believe me , you wo n't miss much !	-1
Let me start off by stating that I got this game with the strategy guide , and I have yet to see what any of the pages look like . This game is painfully easy and un-advanced.In Japan , the gamers were able to play this much more like & quot ; House of the Dead & quot ; games , rather than in the US where it seems that Capcom wants to cash in on the American lust for first-person shooters . The light gun is just something you CAN get for the PSX , but it is n't what you might call & quot ; Standard Issue & quot ; for the conventional hard-core gamer . A light gun additive being required or at least allowed ( I 'm not sure if it is , a gun costs sometimes ... , and I have a few freinds who had problems playing this with it ) would have made this SO MUCH BETTER ! Also , give us rapid fire for the guns ! Also , while I have seen much worse , the graphics can use a serious polishing . Also , the animation is distorted by the fully 3-D world , and the first person view destroys all fear techniques used so well before.The sound is terrible . To start off , there is really no decent music like in RE 's 2 & amp ; 3 , the music in here is really both bland and pathetic . Also , the voice acting is pretty bad , but I 'm sure that it would sound a whole lot better if it did n't sound like you were listening to them underwater . However , while the sound it awful , it 's nowhere near as completely worthless as much as the sound in the first RE title ( mainly the beyond dismal music and voice acting ) .Now , the story , well , actually , it 's not so bad . It does have a really good setup and a few good plot twists , and also the main character was told to investigate by his freind Leon S Kennedy ( the hero of RE2 who could with one finger kick Chris Redfeild 's ... ! ) ! Also , the area 's that are only accessible through replay have some excellent files that rival the best of RE 's 2 & amp ; 3 . However , the decent ( although terribly short ) storyline is destroyed by all lack of realism in the gameplay . I mean face it ; you fight a Tyrant only 20 minutes into the game , the puzzles solve themselves , enemies ca n't hit you when they are directly behind you , and even if they could , you have SO MUCH health , and you generally start off in the same basic location when you start with your next & quot ; life & quot ; .All in all , this game is far from worthless , but even further from being able to hold onto the & quot ; Resident Evil & quot ; title it holds . I liked the first one , I was blown away by the second , the third one rocked my world , and now ... this . I 'm now just waiting for Code Veronica for the PS2 , while playing something else .	-1
WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT ! FOR THE RESIDENT EVIL SERIES , THIS GAME REALLY SUCKS BIG TIME . THE STORY IS LAME , THE CONTROLS ARE DIFFERENT FROM PAST RESIDENT EVIL GAMES . FIRST PERSON SHOOTERS SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED WITH A RESIDENT EVIL GAME . THESE TITLES WERE MEANT LIKE THE FIRST 3 RE GAMES , THIS GAME SUCKS LIKE RE DEAD AIM . IF YOU WANT A GREAT RE GAME , GET THE FIRT 3 , PLUS CODE VERONICA X , AND RE 4 , NOW THESE ARE RE GAMES . NOT THIS LAME RE SURVIVOR .	-1
Ok let me tell you this . RENT DONT EVEN DARE BUY ! The only thing that kicks on this game is first person view mode . But this game is not even fun . You work for umbrella in some crazy city a little after resident evil 3 and you fall from a helicopter and get amnesia not knowing you are the most feared person in the world . You screw around killing zombies but you never ever ever get to have any fun at all . Whats with capcom now ? Why are they so lazy now when it comes that they make even greater games than konami does . Now one game i reccomend is Resident Evil Code Veronica , its very fun .	-1
Resident Evil Survivor , the black sheep of the Resident Evil family . Compared to the rest of the Resident Evil 's , yes , this game is bad . However , it is not unplayable . The lack of any and all save points means that you 're going to have to go thru the entire game in one sitting ... and that can be quite a challenge . However , considering how easy the game is , it 's not because of difficulty . This game just is bad . Now , if you have a bunch of friends over who love Resident Evil like you do and you just want to be able to say you beat them all , this game does have some redeeming value . It 's great for a laugh with a group of friends at just how bad it is . This game is more of a collectors item for those who want to have the entire Resident Evil series and who want to beat them all rather than for those who want a fun and enjoyable game to play . Stay away unless you 're Resident Evil thru and thru . NnyCW for CapCity .	-1
All I have to say is that this game is horrible . I found little in it I liked and I loved all the others in the RE series.I found the gameplay to be almost & quot ; pre-RE1 & quot ; .	-1
In Resident Evil : Survivor , you play an amnesia stricken man wandering around a zombie infested town looking for clues to his past . The first thing you 'll notice about the game is it 's first person perspective and that the game was clearly meant to use a light gun prepheral but does not ( yet it 's Japanese counterpart does ) . That major drawback , combined with the choppy animation , muddy sound , poor controls , and near none replayability , make Resident Evil : Survivor one big disappointment of a game . It 's worth playing if your a longtime fan of the Resident Evil series , but do n't expect much out of it other than an intriguing side story to the saga . Capcom has once again made another first person light gun aimed Resident Evil game called Resident Evil : Dead Aim for the PS2 , and that game is quite an improvement over this piece of crud .	-1
Actually if it werent for the zombies i proabably wouldnt know that it was a Resident Evil game . This game gives RE a bad name ! First of all its short ! Short as in an hour and a half of gameplay for you first time playing it ! Next is it has an awful story line ! You a dude who lost his memory and thinks hes vincient ( who is bad ) and latter recovers his memory . Bosses ... .. im not sure if there are any , you run into Mr.X a few times but thats all besides the final tyrant ... ... very easy ! I just stood there while he ran in circles around me and jumbed over me and shot at him . Graphics ... ... .hmmmm not good not good ! Another thing is if your gon na play it and have a short ammout of time and think you can just play it , get a little ways in and save your wrong ! No saves , nope none . Have i already said this game is easy ? First time playing my ranking was an A . What about ammo , will you ever run out ? Not in this game because you have unlimited ammo with the hand gun ! Pluse you find ammo like crazy for the other guns ! If you like playing bad games or are a huge resident evil fan get this game ! If not forget it and play dino crisis2 or resident evil code : veronica !	-1
Well what can I say . This game doesnt really suck , but isnt that good . The idea of a first person view was a good idea but this game lacked in several areas . The plot wasnt very good at all . It seemed as if the game was just thrown together to just put something on the market . I 'm a huge fan of the resident evil series , but this game was a real dissapointment . My advice is to definatly rent the game first ( it isnt very hard . I beat it in one day ) . If your a fan of the series then its definatly worth playing , but i wouldnt pay for it .	-1
This rates up there with my Sega GT review for worst game ever . Worst graphics I have ever seen for a playstation game and the system is in its 6th year now . All I want to ask Capcom is why release this trash to the public . I 'm the biggest Resident Evil saga fan ever . I bought this game with high hopes and was let down by the biggest video game company in the business . I played it for about an hour couldnt take it anymore and threw the game out of the window . Capcom why I ask why ?	-1
1.the graphics are rehashed from the other games mostly RE 2 only they look crappier.2 . the items are floating , spinning defiances of physics and common sense.3 . the motion capture is terrible , the enemys that are gifted with the ability to jump ( a skill denied to the player . ) the enemys seem to slow down in mid flight . the zombies shuffling motion seem to be all the more drunken puppet show than usual . everything looks like crap4.the voice acting is terrible these people did not care about their job . it was like they were all bored . they all sound completly detached from reality . they have no emotion in their voices . except the sewer dwelling homless balding hobbit . it sounded like they had a grand total of 3 voice actors for the entire game.5.the weapons are completly random , you have the Glock 17 and Sig Saur and a Berreta in the same group as a Nambu which is just confusing . and to furthor confuse you , you get a M70 grenade launcher which is almost useless . then a Spas 12 and a S & W ; model 19 revolver . and you dont get enough SG `` bullets '' like their the rarest ammo to find.6 . the 2 children in the game are stupid lilly apparently survived only because she apparently is so brain dead the zombies either except her as one of their own or fear her because she could make them dumber . and lott has the most anoying voice ever.7.Game play is boring there is just massive dead zones with nothing there . for no reason except to take up game space . the targeting is just annoying the dogs are like crack head fast and will fuse with your legs after a period of time because you cant look down . and while they are down there humping your legs ? they absolutly refuse to do damage to you . the zombies are just there they are no real threat . they are really more of a minor annoyance or target practice . the Hunters and Lickes are just epic failures due to their decreased intelgence attack and HP . it is the only RE that i know of that you can shoot a hunter point blank with the 9MM pistol while standing still and not only live but get away with fine health 6/10 times . health items are way to sparse competing with SG ammo in frequency.8.the translations ( the phone `` hang '' up ) that is the line that says it all . `` I cant remember '' is stated at least four times like a rapid fire machingun of i cant remember caliber . is just blazing away . this is one game that i wish i could havebeen hit by one of those bullets and forgotten about it.9.in conclusion it is not as bad as the playable failure known as big rigs . its still pretty bad . but at least the enemy has AI . and there is some concept of physics and there is background music . but it doesnt play like an RE game . there is just one thing i cant get over it seems to be so laggy and slow .	-1
I LOVE the Resident Evil series . But this game , ow my , it 's the worst game I have ever , ever played . I was thinking to burn the CD , but the fire could be really disappointed burning one bad CD . I know you wo n't find this helpful , but , on my opinion , DO N'T LOOSE MONEY !	-1
the attemt to make the game exciting by putting a lot of stupid puzzles makes this game a not very fun game at all . the battle system is alright and i like the anime sequences that take place . its rather annoying when you get trhough little puzzles , maze like areas that take you ages to figure out . Im used to the experience points and equiping weapons you bought or forged , since its in most other RPGs that ive played . also the fact that you cant skip movies makes it annoying when you die after watching a long movie because you have to watch it again .	-1
This game is quite possibly the stupidest game I have ever played . From the first ( and ONLY ) time I played it , it got on my nerves . The voice acting is terrible and really annoying . In the very beginning on the boat , you walk into a room and the girl whines `` Ohh NOOOO , my jeans are RUINED ! '' That did it for me , I just snapped the game off right there . The graphics are bad for the PS2 , and the way the characters move is all jerky and repetative . They wave their arms when they talk and then kinda forget to stop waving them after they finally shut up . The combat system not very good , you just stand in one place and idly blast enemies with badly-animated spells . If you see this one on the shelf , do n't even give it a second glance , just move on and get something else . ANYTHING can be better than this .	-1
if you buy this game you are buying a drink coaster - it is horrible - the comabat system is horrible - the characters are horrible - the graphics are glitchy and the controls leave much to be desired - THIS IS A LAUNCH GAME - which means it is one of the oldest games out - DO NOT BUY _ buy DARK ALLIANCE INSTEAD	-1
This is one of those games that was all hype and nothing to back it up . the previews looked amazing but the aftermath is that Orphen has ver dissapointing gameplay . the only good thing about this game was the battles . the battle system was very innovative and fun to learn , however this game will dissapoint even the most hardcore fans of the anime .	-1
I love role playing games , and the Playstation 2 graphics were incredible on some of the other games we 've played . When I popped Orphen into the CD player , I was really expecting something spectacular . Unfortunately , the game did n't quite live up to the promise.You play a male , Orphen , in his late teens , who is a loner with an attitude . He has a brother-sister pair with him , Cleo and Magnus , who spend the entire time sniping at each other and at him . `` Shut up , '' he snarls at them . `` Well , duh ! '' the girl cries out in response to something else . When water breaks in , her panic cry was not of the danger they were in , but `` My favorite clothes ! ! `` Their two 'bodyguards ' are n't much better - with their bickering , I actually cheered when a monster crab grabbed one and threw him into the water . I kept hoping that one would grab the annoying siblings as well , and get rid of them . Come to think of it , even the main character needed a good swat in the head.The magic Orphen uses is intriguing . His weapons have names like `` Bite of Lightning , '' `` Sword of the Fallen Devil , '' and `` Hand of Pyro . '' You do n't have to remember their names - he cries them out quite often enough . That 's when you 're lucky enough to be in combat ... a lot of the time the game simply freezes when you 're moving , going into a pre-set series of actions that mostly involve the main characters yelling at or picking on each other.If you could only skip through them , it might be playable . But you can't.The graphics are reasonably good , the monsters you meet are interesting , but there is n't anything to move you along through the game , except for the desperate hope that SOMETHING will come along and knock some sense into the characters . Unfortunately for everyone involved , this never happens.If you 're looking for a great RPG , I 'd wholeheartedly recommend Final Fantasy IX over this game . If you already have FFIX , then you might rent this one to understand just how good the FFIX team really is .	-1
This game is what 's wrong with so called RPG 's today , or any game as a matter of fact . In an RPG i thought that it was Role Playing , not some kind of comic book . You just do n't play most of this game , you just watch . The battle system is just plain stupid , who just stand there and the enemy 's come toward 's you . The save points are at the most random spot 's of the game and the cut scenes are just horrible , the voice acting to the dubing . And they are BORING , if you die you have to watch them all over again , and you ca n't skip them . Do n't buy this game , watch the anime , it is basicly the same thing !	-1
Orphen was another prime example of a rushed game that wanted to be a launch title . It contains a little bit of [ bad ] voice acting at the beginning , then from there they gave up and no one moves their mouth . As for gameplay , it 's very limited , pretty boring , and overall lacking . ... I do n't even know why they call it orphen . You just live out someone elses adventure as you join their party . The story is one of the worst ever made . ... my point is the story [ is bad ] , and everything else about this game [ is bad ] , it 's the ... game that ever ... . Use the disk as it was obviously intended to be used as . A frizbee .	-1
This is by far the WORST role playing game I 've ever played ! The Battle systum ( STINKS ) ! You have 3 buttons wich you equip weapons to , every button executes that weapon , but you ca n't move and the voice programing gets anoying ! And the voice acting is VERY poorly acted ! There is NOT one message you read in this game ! It is all the charecters voices , so those of you who have no volume , are scrwed ! And the story line , HA ! The worst ! It seems like a 4 year old worte it who knew `` cool words '' like `` damn '' and `` hell '' it is very sad ! It is so corney you will die laughing ! ( actually , thats the best thing about it ! ) And the game play hours stink ! And so does the ending ! The graphics are good , but thats it ! It is above all boring ! oh ! There are some cartoon clips that ar n't SO BAD.And you have absolutely no options on where to go or secret places ! You just go straight through the story line on what you 're supposed to do ! Do your self a BIG favor ! Do n't buy this game , here is my over-all raitings- ( 1-5 stars ) Game play hours-**Battle systum-*Re-play value-*Storyline-*Graphics-****Music-***Sound effects-**Voice programing-**Mapping-*Neeed i say more ?	-1
Ok I bought this game 1 hour ago and I 'm already thinking of excusses to take it back ! This game has nice graphics , but it feels like I 'm flying in an air ballon ! ! Do all the planes blow up with one hit ? ! I prefere they fly around alittle more with some smoke and then die ? ! I 'm playing it tonight for a couple of hours but in the morning I 'm going back to ( the store ) ! ( ... )	-1
All this game has going for it is the graphics and the name . Too bad it has absolutly nothing to do with the movie . This game is garbage ... .get Ace Combat 4 !	-1
From the first BOF down to this one , the quality has gradually declined . Sure , it looks prettier than it used to , but with few weapons , fewer spells and less variety with each passing episode , the series is looking more than a little thread-bare.The combat system is good , though it has n't changed hardly at all since the last time . The spells and skills are copied more or less directly from number III , including such goodies as Flare , Jump and other low-cost , useful abilities . The multi-elemental spell thing was cool but made less useful by the inclusion of a variety of useless or near-useless combinations . Some of the high-power spells require the combination of elements boss-level monsters are immune to and do an overwhelming amount of damage to regular monsters ; they simply are n't necessary.The monsters are just slighter higher resolutions of old beasties from the last three games and the dragon spells , while nice to look at , just are n't all that useful or interesting . I used them once and then stopped using them alltogether.The fairies are about the only thing that 's improved over the last installation , with multiple uses for fairies and the opportunity to build a significant and powerful attack force with the fairy spells.The movie clips were a nice touch , but they are n't as good as some other RPG movie clips . Check out the new Chrono Trigger/FFIII disc and you 'll see what I mean.On the whole , it just was n't all that great . Still , I 've now defeated all four games several times over . When BOF V comes out , I 'll check it out before buying it , though .	-1
Do n't be hooked by the fact that you can play as megaman or the other capcon fighters . The weapons of all the players are basicly the same . You shoot a bullent with your right hand , and you shoot a special large blast with your left hand . Thats all you can do ! ! Megaman does not have a large inventory of weapons like he does in his other games.The arenas are very small , and there are only about 8 stages . AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO SKILL INVOLVED . Based on how you select the difficulty level , the game will be either too easy , or impossible to beat.The only reason why people are giving this game a good rating is because they , or their friends , are trying to sell overpriced used copies .	-1
Graphics : 5/10 - The colour shading is nice when you 're playing outside , but for the rest of the time , this looks pretty effortless and droopy . It 's also hard to see where a passage leads.Sound : 5/10 - The usual cartoon racing score hangs in the background , while the cars do n't do anything too dramatic with their engines.Value : 5/10 - Most racing games are worth the money because they 're entertaining , but to make a long story short , this one is n't really worth paying for unless you 're a really big fan of the muppets.Overall : 5/10 - This is the sort of game you play in the game or record store while your waiting for Mum to finish her grocery shopping . In a game where you can hardly see where you 're going , is it worth even playing ? Yes , but only if Mum takes a couple of hours to find a broccoli stick .	-1
This game is very difficult and the racers are hard to control . I got this for my daughter as a Christmas gift in 2000 and she was 7-1/2 at that time . She tried to play it several times and has found it very difficult and frustrating to play . I 've tried playing it myself and found it very difficult to control . It definately is not a Crash Team Racing , which was easier to play.Unless you can get this game at a substantially reduced price or for free I would n't waste the money on it as it is a difficult game to play & amp ; control .	-1
Ok I 'll get straight to the point so I can keep this one short guys.Do n't take this the wrong way , as I used to be a PS one purist , but there is not A SINGLE reason to buy this dated system now , not one.I mean c'mon , why would you want to buy a 32 bit system what with the 128 bit Sega Dreamcast going down to a hundred bucks as well ? I have both of the systems , and I can tell you that this thing just is n't that fun to play at all anymore.It has had some good games , but sony is still pushing the software without a dcent price drop.Another problem , are peripherals.If you have more than one friend you will have to buy a multi-tap adaptor to play games , a pointless adition considering most all systems ( even the 64 , come on guys , the 64 ... ) have controller ports built into the system.The hardware is old , and pales in comparison to a more superrior system like a Dreamcast , and the prices are exactly the same , no different.So all in all , this system is n't going anywhere , the games and hardware are sorely dated , and there is no internet or third party backing it.I let a friend & quot ; borrow & quot ; mine ... .	-1
This machine is no match for the new consoles . So say bye-bye to it .	-1
Okay , here 's the gist of things . EQ finally got to a point where it was almost bug free ... ... .then out comes ROK . They still run patch after patch trying to fix little problems , and graphics glitches ... .and then they come out with yet ANOTHER expansion ? Do n't we get the picture yet ? It 's not about quality of gameplay , people ... ... ... it 's about the bottom line . I could go into a 5 page dissertation on why I despise Verant and their company , and why the majority of people who are looking for a good gameplaying experience will walk away shaking their heads sadly ... .at the potential wasted , but I digress . Fix the car before doing a brand new paint job . Otherwise , you have something that LOOKS real great ... ... .but goes nowhere .	-1
I expected this game to really rule . I thought to myself , & quot ; Tens of thousands of players rpging together ? It will be chaos ! People will be banding into nations and battling each other for dominion ! Imagine my disappointment when I found that pking is not only disallowed ( or restricted ) , in most servers , most players I talked to professed DISGUST at player killers ! Worse , guards are now near invulnerable . What ? Ca n't a guy have a little fun and slip a 6-inch dagger between a guard 's plates and into his back ? It 's only an AI . I pray for the day that someone with a sense of fun ( dreary drugdgery , which is what this game is starting to feel like after four months ) takes over this company and point this world into the right direction .	-1
With all the great reviews , I thought I would give it a try . Yeah , it 's dated , but I expected that . Some dated games are fun ... I just did n't think this was one of them . I played it for about 5 hours on & # 34 ; normal & # 34 ; , which was enough time to learn the controls and understand the game play . The map is difficult to read/understand . The psychic abilities are okay , but switching to them takes a little time ... enough time for the zombies or monkeys to kill you . I found the interface a bit clunky . I just could n't get excited about this game or the story/narration . I thought it was tedious , not fun.I was able to get this working on Windows XP Home SP3 , but it took a little effort.If you need help , go to youtube and search for this video : hHg1cXfTUBcHe does a good job of explaining how to do it.Here it is in a nutshell : install the gamefind , download , and install SystemShock2_patch.exein the installation folder , rename sshock2.exe to sshock2.oldfind and download SystemShock2_xp_2000_fix.zipcopy the exe from the above zip file to the installation folderin the installation folderopen shock.cfg with notepadat the end of that file , on a separate line , add this : safe_texture_managersave and exit the fileWindows XP boot.ini changes ( BE CAREFUL ! ) go to control panel , system , advanced , startup and recovery , settingsclick editadd the following line under the [ operating system ] section : multi ( 0 ) disk ( 0 ) rdisk ( 0 ) partition ( 1 ) \WINDOWS= & # 34 ; Microsoft Windows XP - System Shock 2 Game & # 34 ; /noexecute=optin /fastdetect /numproc=1save the boot.ini filerebootwhen prompted , select the & # 34 ; Microsoft Windows XP - System Shock 2 Game & # 34 ; optionWindows boots like usualplay the gameAfter you play the game through to its ending , be sure to remove the & # 34 ; numproc=1 & # 34 ; line that you added to boot.ini.Visit my Amazon Collections to see my 4-star and 5-star PC games : http : //www.amazon.com/gp/customers/A12LH2100CKQO/collections	-1
The only game harder than this is the ridiculously difficult & quot ; Aliens vs. Pedator & quot ; ( that 's right , hardcore gamers , play it on the & quot ; extra hard & quot ; setting ) . S.S.2 is too freakin ' hard for its own good . Not to brag , but I am very good at games like this but C'mon already ! & quot ; It 's so creepy & quot ; - Yeah , especially when enemies appear from nowhere and smoke you quicker than a lightning bolt . & quot ; But you have guns and stuff & quot ; - that break 5 seconds after you use them and try finding ammo when you need it . Health Packs - finding them is one thing , having time to use them is another . & quot ; Wow , what great level desi- & quot ; BANG , CRUNCH ! ! oops , I got killed again . Sightseeing is not a good idea in this game.However , the game does come with an ample supply of cheat codes but you have to use them at the right time . Do n't start typing in the code for extra health or ammo when trouble is about to start , its too late at that point . I managed to get through the game by stocking up on health , ammo and abilities at every opportunity . By & quot ; opportunity & quot ; I mean when I was crouched behind a steel storage box while an automated gun was blasting away in my direction . Get the picture ?	-1
This game has many positive aspects as detailed by other reviewers , but was just too violent for me . I found the images of severed heads and limbs disturbing . While the game does have some good strategy elements and character development , in the end it is a first person shooter and your main activity is killing . The plot was very good and kept my going long enough to finish the game . I guess I should stick with Lucas Arts titles .	-1
I never cared about multiplay for this game , I do n't mind the difficulty ( in fact I enjoyed it ) , and I thought the graphics were fine ( especially for when it was released ) . Having been a huge System Shock 1 fan , I was first in line ( pretty much literally , too ) to buy this sequel when it was released , and for the most part I absolutely loved it.Now let me qualify `` for the most part '' . That means everything until about three major levels before the end , at which point the game completely buried itself . To this day , I even remember the specific point at which I realized it had passed the point of non-redemption : where you found several very tall columns sliding up and down that were supposed to be ( ahem ) `` teeth '' , and you had to jump across them a la 80 's side-scroller . The ending of this game ( along with the couple of levels immediately preceding it ) was so incredibly god-awful that I have to ding not 1 , not 2 , but *3* stars . It it just that bad.An ending this bad , that ruins what was a masterpiece of a game leading up to it , is nothing new in computer games . In fact , one of the highest-profile examples of it is quite similar to SS2 , and that is Half-Life . Now , if you 're the type that 's able to overlook a game 's ending and enjoy just portions of the journey for their own sake , then you 'll likely enjoy this game more than 2 stars ' worth . However , if you 're like me and can think of few game design sins worse than a horrible ending , than my rating stands . SS2 started out as one of the best sequels I 'd ever played , and ultimately ended as one of the most disappointing .	-1
I have played through both the original System Shock and System Shock 2 to completion . Having done so , I have to say that SS2 is one of the most over-rated games in history , and every time it shows up on some game magazine 's `` overlooked works of genius '' page or the like , I want to scream.First , let me get it out of the way : Yes , the story is very good ( and I was particularly struck by the plot twist that introduces your ultimate enemy . ) Yes , the sound design is good . Yes , the atmosphere is great- very spooky , very isolating.But it 's one thing to feel that your enemies hate you , and another entirely to feel that the _game_ hates you.There are a dozen little ways this comes off , like that you can HURT yourself by running into things , and make it WORSE by increasing your agility stat and thus your speed . I do believe that 's a first for First-Person-Shooters , and _please_ , for the love of God , let it be the last . There 's the fact that you can be shot a dozen times by an enemy , and when you finally kill him , mysteriously discover the weapon he was firing on you was not only devoid of ammunition , but broken to boot . There 's that the game 's system explicitly _expects_ you to die repeatedly ( if you have enough money you get restored to life at a sort of save-point , more on that later . ) There 's a sequence that has you running back and forth trying to find a series of numbers for a passcode , one number per location , and all the while , the monsters keep up their infinite respawn while you 're about your busy-work . ( What would have been the problem with your so-called benefactor putting the entire code in one location ? ... ) But ultimately , it comes down to economics . The designers were so terribly afraid that the player would , at some time , have an EXCESS of something , that they overcompensated the other way.The money of the game is called nanites , and ultimately , they 're used for everything . Die and get restored to life ? Cough up some nanites . Want to open a locked box ? Cough up some nanites ... Oh , and by the way , all that box contains is slightly fewer nanites than it cost you to try . ( Why did someone put a security lock on the equivalent of a nickel ? One of those great mysteries , I guess . ) Out of ammo ? Go to the vending machine , and cough up some more nanites . Or you could hack the machine- for yet more nanites- and then it would give you LOWER PRICES ! I do n't know about you , but when I hack something like a vending machine , I expect to get something for free . I guess I 'm silly that way.And even if you have ammo , your gun might just break , given the uniquely corrosive qualities of the atmosphere on the ship . But do n't worry , you can buy a repair tool- for a few nanites ! ( Though repairing a weapon degrades its quality , and makes it more likely to break down in the future . Thanks , guys. ) Poisoned ? Your fate is sealed , unless you buy an antidote . More nanites ! Or you can buy a recycling tool , and discover that what it gives you for recycling most items would n't buy you a lousy soft drink.Maybe you 're a psionic , using the awesome , infinite powers of the human mind as your weapon ? Great- but restoring your psychic energies means buying a psi-restoring potion . More nanites ! For all the talk in the manual about making psionics more than `` just another gun '' , this particular aspect succeeds in making them _exactly_ that , and a gun much like the others that is going to fire twice and then need to be switched out for something that still has ammo.And is n't broken.And you have the skill to use.After a few rounds of `` BANG BANG click click & lt ; switch > BANG BANG BANG click & lt ; switch > ZAP ZAP ZAP click click & lt ; switch > '' you realize that what 's making the hairs on the back of your neck stand up is n't terror , it 's IRRITATION.A simple equation : Infinite , respawing enemies + Finite resources = game that hates you . Is it really so much to ask that a foe that 's been shooting you have ammunition on them ? Especially if you 're going to have to face an unlimited supply of them ? There 's a moment in most games of both the RPG and FPS genre near the end where you feel that you are _ready_ . You 're bad . You 've got the best weapons , a full stock of ammunition , the best spells , or whatever- you 've learned the tactics you need to take on foes over many hours of play , and you know that what 's coming up is going to be hard and it 's going to take ingenuity and everything you 've got . But it 's going to be fun and you have what you need to make it possible , and you 're ready.In System Shock 2 , that moment never comes . The designers were too afraid of the player having an excess , and as a result , you never have _enough_ . Not even at the end . You 've been nickeled and dimed through the whole game by poison , by the unending tide of zombies , by busy-work , by hacking or lockpicking things that turned out not to be worth the sacrifices , by taking damage in places you did n't expect , by reloading and repairing weapons that break down at a fantastic rate ... And ultimately , that 's not scary . It 's frustrating . It 's irritating . It 's wearying . But it 's not scary.And yes , I finished the game . No , I felt no compulsion to play through it again as a different type of character.There 's other little things , like that they replaced the ungainly but interesting pseudo-VR hacking of the original System Shock with a guessing game somewhere in complexity between tic-tac-toe and minesweeper . Or that the only thing your character actually says for the entire game deflates the tension of a climactic moment for the sake of a dumb joke . Or that the bad guys seem to offer you the opportunity to ally with them , but the designers never considered making that opportunity a real one ... I 've said more than enough . Pick up the original Deus Ex if you like games of the genre ; let this `` sleeper hit '' continue sleeping.P.S . At least two of the _positive_ reviewers have blithely stated something along the lines of `` Well , yes , it 's so hard you have to use cheat codes to complete it , but ... '' Do you guys really expect so little of game designers that you 're willing to forgive this kind of grotesque mis-design in pacing and difficulty ? Are you so desperate for games with an actual storyline that you 're willing to ignore enormous flaws ?	-1
If you 're looking , as I was , for a Counterstrike substitute , keep looking . Ultimately what kills this game is playability . The game play is not engaging . Graphics are lacking a bit -- look at the way that everything LOOKS like a flat surface with a texture layed on it . Ultimately thats not a big complaint though , it looks passable . It 's just not that fun .	-1
In SEVEN GAMES OF THE SOUL , you play the role of an elderly caretaker of an abandoned amusement park . You are approached by the devil with a task : witness the stories of seven individuals , and decide whether their souls will go to heaven or hell . It seemed like a fascinating premise , and I was eager to see how it would be handled in a computer game.I 'll admit it 's my own fault for not making sure the game would run properly under Windows XP . It does n't . It will run , but it is n't at all pleasant . The animated sequences get stuck frequently , and the audio is choppy . It 's a good thing subtitles are available for the dialogue , although most of it is nonsensical , metaphysical gibberish anyway . As of this writing , there is no patch to make the game XP-compatible.But operating issues are only part of the problem . The puzzles , if they can be called that , are so obtuse you 'd have to be some kind of savant to be able to complete them unaided . There is absolutely no logic to them at all . At a later point in the game , you 're rewarded with a demonic assistant , but the clues it offers are invariably for activities you 've already completed . Apparently the clues are based on your physical location , not how far you 've actually progressed in the game . Except for a couple manual tasks you need it to perform , it is useless.The graphics are fairly nice , but interacting with things is also problematic . Hot spots are frustratingly obscure and you can move over them a half dozen times before they register . Occasionally , they are misplaced entirely . There is one room you ca n't exit until you make a quarter turn away from the door and click on a blank wall . And I am currently at a standstill in my game because a drawer I need to open will not open . I have gone over every inch of that room to no avail . What good is a game that you can not finish even with a walkthrough ? SEVEN GAMES OF THE SOUL ( or FAUST as it is referred to in the game itself ) is a huge disappointment . It could have been interesting , but it getting through any portion of the game was torture .	-1
A strange little game which starts very ambitiously and really gets lost along the way somewhere . There are a number of borderline offensive features -- such as the sex dream sequence , the subtext that Satan 's not such a bad guy after all , and the Uncle Tom-like black character in overalls -- but the thing that really turned me off was the bad writing , bad animation , and bad acting . Or maybe it 's just a bad translation ? All in all , not really worth the bother .	-1
In the early part of the 20th century , a man named Theodore More built an amusement park called Dreamland . The park was inhabited by various societal misfits -- a pair of Siamese twins , an animal trainer with parental issues , a fat lady , etc. -- all of whom had some dealings of an infernal nature with a gentleman named Mephisto . Now there 's some dissension in the upper realms as to whether all these people deserved what they got and an everyman -- Marcellus Faust -- is sent to explore the past and sort things out._Faust : Seven Games of the Soul_ is a game that players seem either to love or hate . The ones who love it cite its adult themes , great soundtrack , decent graphics and freedeom of exploration . Its detractors refer to illogical puzzles , technical problems , random action triggers and lack of a truly coherent story . All these things , both the good and the bad , are part and parcel of this game . Taking all into account , I fully expected to be one of the pro-Faust camp . I wasn't.In the first place , as another reviewer has pointed out , this game really does n't run very well on XP . You can get it to run if you use a compatability mode and turn your sound acceleration all the way down . But sound in the cutscenes is still extremely choppy and there are numerous things in the game that do n't work . Half the features on the main menu simply do n't function . Some of these features are supposed to be helpful in gameplay ( detailed notes on each character , for example , that just are n't there ) . Some are things that have led others to give Faust high ratings ( no matter what , I could only access one song from the soundtrack ) so their lack really had an impact . Within the game there are numerous glitches as well -- hotspots that do n't appear , or appear far from where they 're supposed to , cutscenes that do n't play , things that do n't work . Just for that , I found attempting to play Faust a frustrating experience.But it 's when you get to the story that things really fall apart . In seven episodes , each devoted to one of the park 's denizens , you 're supposed to unveil a greater mystery . And you do , kind of . But the episodes themselves are too short and lack detail , and only a few of them contribute to the greater story . Otherwise , you 're exploring territory that 's infuriatingly random . Some of these people had relationships with each other . Some did n't . What 's the point and who cares ? By the end , I didn't.The puzzles were a mixed bag , mostly inventory-based with a few combination locks -- not enough variety to excite me , I 'm afraid . And here , too , the randomness showed . There was too much inventory that you picked up that had no purpose other than to trigger a cutscene . There was other inventory that you picked up that had no purpose at all and later disappeared ( what was that baseball bat for ? ? ? ? ? ) There were puzzles that were so obtuse that there was no possibility that one could solve them without at least a nudge and puzzles that gave no indication they HAD been solved , so I still had to consult a walkthrough to see what was going on . There were puzzles with so many possible solutions -- putting a number of words into order in a sentence , for example , when those words would make sense in a hundred different orders -- that solving them would take days . I generally play without hints or a walkthrough , so having to exit the game and consult one about five times an episode just to follow the gameplay was truly annoying . Also , towards the end of every episode you 're suddenly thrust into a totally different location where you have to complete some action unrelated to anything else to move on . The whole experience was like being shunted back and forth along a series of badly running bumper cars.After everything else , the revelation of the `` true '' story and the final decision were a letdown and the two endings , good and bad , were frankly abrupt , meaningless and had the feeling of being slapped on.I completed Faust in under 20 hours . It would have been shorter if I 'd known what was going on . I have to say , for all the disappointments , it IS a haunting game and I DO keep thinking about it . I think if I had an older computer on which to play older games I 'd play it again ; maybe I 'd like it better . But on modern machines , by the standards of today 's games , it just does n't measure up .	-1
Where to begin with this boring game ? As a hardcore Final Fantasy fan , I find it hard to start on how disappointing this game is.First of all , the characters . They 're lame . The main character is this stupid monkey boy who 's part of a theater troupe . That 's not very badass ! After making the super cool ex SOLDIER Cloud and SeeD in training Squall , what was Squaresoft thinking ? Did they not look back at the past final fantasies and get that the protagonist is supposed to be a badass ? Losers hanging with this failure of a protagonist include a little kid with no face ( who came up with THAT design ? ) , an annoying guy in armor who always jumps up and down , a girl with purple hair ( lol , is this an supposed to be an anime ? ) , and another girl that 's named after a weapon she does n't even use , awesome . None of these characters are as awesome as Barret or as hot as Tifa and they all look like they came out of a cartoon , another failure on Squaresoft 's part.Next , the story . It 's stupid . The only thing I can recall from my boredom is that it involves stealing a princess during a play performance ( wtf ? ) and preventing an airship from blowing up or something like that . The main villain is some fat blue lady . What the hell is that about ? While playing this I just sat there wishing Sephiroth would jump into the scene and stab her ! I stopped playing after the first disc , where in the end some white haired chick looks down at the dead characters and flies off on a dragon ( was that supposed to be a female Sephiroth or what ? who cares ) The world was boring . It was all castles and medieval crap like that . Hello ! Final Fantasies are supposed to take place in futuristic worlds with technology and guns ! Lastly , the battle system . What a pile of crap . Only the stupid kid can cast black magic , the girl is the only one who can heal , and the other guys are the only ones who can use real weapons . What kinda system is that ? It 's like they 're each supposed to have a designated role ! You 're supposed to have 'em learn spells though materia ! Oh wait , only REAL Final Fantasies are allowed to have materia , my bad . Also , why do you control four party members ? First of all , that makes this game even more confusing and stupid , and second of all , REAL Final Fantasies have only three party members ! In conclusion , this game fails to please any Final Fantasy fan due to to Squaresoft 's failure to take a look at the franchise 's roots . If Square had looked back and reflected on what made Final Fantasy such a great series to begin with , they would have known this game would be a disappointment to any longtime Final Fantasy fan such as myself .	-1
Where is the quality from the last game Final Fantasy VIII ? I mean the game does n't interest me at all in the beginning , it is too manga and comic relief inspired , and has no real seriousness about it . This makes this a less & quot ; hardcore & quot ; experience than the Final Fantasy 8.I miss the depth in the characters , and I also miss the complex story that was so evident in 7 , and 8 . Bad game ! I just hope they increase the dark feel of the next game , because this one was too goodie goodie for my taste .	-1
Final Fantasy IX starts out as being a completely different experience . However , it is soon apparent that Square was not thinking correctly when doing this storyline . The monsters almost all bear names that have appeared in previous titles , the black mage ( though cool ) and the Dragon Knight ( wicked , but enough is enough ) resurface quickly and linger throughout the game . At first it 's fun to see these popular themes resurface , but it has gone way too far . The only plus sides to this game that I can think of are : the great graphics and animation and the music ( Uematsu has done it again ! ) Plus the RPG is too short ; if you can get an item by beating the game in less than 12 hours , it is too short , ok ? No questions asked .	-1
Beautiful Game . It 's just that this game gives you the worst directions EVER for you to follow and then expect you to find it while throwing a random battle at you every 3 seconds that you walk . Annoying as hell .	-1
A lot of FF9 fans are immediately going to say my review is poor simply because I 'm disagreeing with them . Please know that this is not the case ... I 've spent many years of my life playing , analyzing and reviewing the installments of the Final Fantasy series , and with FF9 I am most dissatisfied.It 's very difficult to find where to begin in expressing exactly why this is the worst installment of the Final Fantasy series ever . For starters , I 'm going to warn the consumer that if you 've played other FF games in general ( the good ones ... 8 does n't count ! ) , and compare them to FF9 , then you are most assuredly not going to like this game.The first thing wrong with this game is the mere theme of it . FF9 has a character and plot theme that is so frustratingly childish and kiddy-friendly that one could mistake this for a Gamecube game . In all honesty , that 's an understatement . The music only contributed to this flaw ... the music track could go into a Disney movie , most assuredly , without notice . Last time that I checked , Disney does not belong in FF , despite what Uematsu ( composer for FF9 ) thinks . I should also point out at the beginning of my review that I guaruntee that this is the shortest game in the series . The first CD to this game will still be spinning in the CD case from the leftover momentum of its rotation in the PS when you complete Final Fantasy 9 . It IS too short.I 'm not ignorant enough to be driven away just by theme . The battle system and process of character growth is easily the most uncreative and fun-lacking system in the series . You learn your abilities from weaponry and items , which means that before you can upgrade to the next level of weaponry you must finish the painfully slow process of acquiring all the abilities on that particular item . Challenging , I do admit , but not the least bit fun.FF9 promised its oldschool fans that it would once again display the old-themed characters like Black and white mages , thieves , etc . Do n't be fooled ... this is hardly true . What you get in this package is two PC mages of both classes , a brief encounter with a Red Mage , and some old names . Oh yeah , and the main character is a thief , but his abilities have nothing to do with being an oldschool FF thief . That 's about it for this game.Mark my words : The Chocobo sidequest is NOT fun . It consists of your running around in a single location for several hours , gathering treasure and collecting points . You can buy special stuff with the points , but you 're going to have to spend an AWFUL long time in there to get anything useful . Another illusion set by squaresoft to make you believe its fun ? I think so.Most importantly , the plot was the killing stroke for a game that had no potential in the first place . The plot twist to this game is a left-fielded , ridiculous and random event with no foreshadowing whatsoever . Worst of all , it did n't even bother me story-wise , mostly because there was no reason for me to like any of these characters . I mean , I was more emotional about my Black Mages in FF Tactics , and they did n't even SAY anything.If you 're looking for oldschool , on that note , I strongly suggest FFT . Not as good a plot as FF7 , but definitely much more solid gameplay . If you 're looking for an FF game that is not bad , do not buy FF9 , by all means . It is NOT worth your time . In fact , I think FF10 is an apology for this horrendous waste of CD 's . The playable demo on jampack is superb ! ( ... )	-1
You 've read all the five star reviews.It is undeniable that FF IX has regained the popularity that FF VII once obtained.But , do not be mislead by hype.Heck , this game is the candy-bubblegum pop of all RPGs , the same ol ' ... recycled all over again.Take this ; a group of various personalities planning to stop the plans of an evil queen from world domination.FF trademark.And too , the return of the dreaded random battle system , the addictive ( duh ... ) card game from FFVIII which promises no rewards but..satisfaction ( woohhoo..rare cards ! But i ca n't turn them into rare materials ! ! ) .And to compare this to FF VII is absolute ... , even ... First of all , the mini-games are , very , very little compared to FF VII.You do n't even have FF IX 's own Gold Saucer , and the mini-games are just the card game , the chocobo & quot ; hot and cold & quot ; ( go digging like a ... to upgrade your chocobo and get rare items ) , and a numb mini-game which involves the big , fat Quina catching frogs hopping around the marshes.What about the gameplay , it 's a drab too.You have your typical stereotype Zidane dominating the game and even characters like Vivi , Dagger ( what a ... dumb name the so hyped translators give ) and Eiko , with powerful spells and summons , is deemed useless.Unlike previous Final Fantasies , each character have it 's own specific abilities.You have Zidane hacking around with his sword , and absolutely useless in magic ( except his trances ) , Vivi , the good-for-nothing little wizard whose magic skills are incomparable to Zidane 's strength ( until very , very later in the game ) , Dagger a.k.a Princess Garnet , with powerful summons ( which are useless when you go hop into the last dungeon ) , Quina a user of blue magic who eats his enemies to learn spells ( only a portion of his spells worked ) .While these characters are like you typical Walt Disney characters or Ben Hur type casts ( sarcasm ) , again compared to Zidane , like extras instead of support characters.And compared to even Square 's & quot ; flop & quot ; FF VIII has more balanced cast of characters.If you think random battle is bearable , like FF VII and FF VIII , this is the most frustrating game after FF VI ( for PSX ) to date , and prepare for countless hours of head banging moments.There is no moogle charm ( FF VI ) or Diablos 's Enc None ( FF VIII ) to ease or diminish random encounters.Worse , every battle is just tiresome , with slow loading times and slow ATB bar.This problem even effects your haste spell , where there is no difference in enemy 's frequent attacks even when you cast it.Finally , this & quot ; light hearted & quot ; Final Fantasy is just not really funny.There is a handful of situations that will only gives you a mere sneer in you face.The dialogue , even with good translators , is lifeless , bland , and lacked with emotion.And it is time for Nobou Uematsu to retire , because 70 % of the game 's soundtrack is pure ... , with MIDIs still his favourite tool.Overall , if you want good graphics..only good graphics and a pure Square fanboy ( i know almost everyone do ) , do n't go cursing at your fellow FF fanatics when you buy and beat the game .	-1
This game has got to be the worst final fantasy ever . There is no way this game could be an dubbed as a final fantasy , i mean seriously come on . This game was one of the easiest games i have ever played and i think it was a simple challenge . i did n't even 9 hours straight i passed way more quickly than any other final fantasy . if you want to check it out that 's up to you , but take my advice , it 's not worth it .	-1
FF8 is absolutely brilliant so get that . FF9 is OK but it is n't even as good as 7 , never mind 8 . The characters is one of the things that lets this down . I ca n't wait for 10	-1
This game started out fun enough . It was only my second racing game ( the first being Moto GP ) and I thought I was missing something . It turns out that it was the game that was missing something . The earlier tracks are easy enough but as you go up they become increasingly difficult until there is little more involved then sheer luck and even that does n't work . Cars crash and this is about the only way you can move up in the posistions . There are only a few songs and they rapidly become annoying . The effects are nothing special and the cars fly apart in large chunks , all in all it 's not very thrilling . The hidden bonus cars are fairly ridiculious and a few even make it difficult to drive because you ca n't see the track as they are so big , there 's actually a car in the shape of a big spider ( legs and all ) . This was a pretty disappointing game .	-1
Midway has taken an ultra precise and often boring form of racing_Indy cart_and turned it inside out.Real physics are out the window : The cars powerslide , launch airborne , and in general behave like those in daytona USA.Sounds like a blast right ? Wekk , it is and it isn't.If you 're simply looking for the home version of CART fury you 're in luck_byt beyond that simple order , things slow down a little.The additional Sim mode gives you adjustment options { wing angle , tire pressure.etc . } and a few other real racing features , but tweak as you might , it 's still an arcade racer.Itseems like the absence of the speed burst is the only real difference from the standard game.The mini games are equally so-so.Challenges like follow the line , block your opponent and last man standing are only a few degrees different than an actual race.On the other hand , Lock on lets you shoot missiles at rival cars_that 's a step in the right direction at least.In general , CART fury is a decent game but does n't quite turn the corner to greatness.Maybe if the tracks were more dynamic with hills and valleys { come on , it 's arcadey anyway } and featured more interesting shortcuts , or if there were more turbo boost power-ups ... .One thing is for sure_despite the landslide of loading screens , two player is the way to play.It 's fast , the AI cars still race along , and most importantly it 's competitive.Still.Try this one before you plunk down the big bucks .	-1
This is one of the most average games I 've seen in a long time.After I downloaded the patches and changed my virtual memory settings , most of my problems were solved . The storyline could use some work ... there are few side quests , and the main plot gets lost when you 're hacking and slashing your way through the dungeons.I have n't used a lot of the magical spells . Fireball and lightning bolt , even after my mages advanced in skill level , are still the ones I use the most ... but they are n't as effective once you 're surrounded , then chain lightning is the only way to go , unless you want all of your party members killed off by friendly fire.There is n't a lot of need for the other ones . There are far too many low-level monsters in the dungeons , until you reach the catacombs . Beating up on orcs and skeletons gets kind of dull after a while . There just are n't enough rewards for gaining experience , it seems . I played table top AD & amp ; D in college ( 2nd edition ) , and I remember levelling a lot more often.I liked the music and the graphics . I have n't seen any better graphics in PC computer games lately . But the 3rd edition rules definitely need to be updated , if they have n't been already.Also , the maps need work . I have played other games where after you find a location , you can click on it and walk there automatically . Wandering through dungeons because you , not your characters , ca n't recall where an exit or room is wastes time that could be spent doing other things in the game.If you truly are hard up for cash , then do n't waste your money on this game . It 's expensive for what you actually get .	-1
In the past few years , an annoying trend has emerged in the home computer video game world . Game developers , presumably tortured into submission by their publishers , have been releasing outlandishly buggy games . PoR is another in a long list of casualties.Online role-playing games such as Ultima Online and Everquest were barely functional at release . Black and White crashed constantly . Anarchy Online was a complete joke . Even Max Payne had a couple problems at first ( in this case , the patch was out within a couple days ) .This & quot ; release and then patch & quot ; method of rushing a game out the door has got to stop . Often the problems are n't fixed for weeks . In the case of PoR , a few people actually had parts of Windows removed due to a bug with the uninstaller . The other problems people have reported are too numerous to list . Add to this some gameplay balance mistakes ( or possibly bugs ) , and you 've got an army of angry computer RPG fans flooding the official PoR forums with vitriolic hate letters.The saddest thing , in the end , is that all of these problems are with a game that turns out to not even be that good . It 's a notch above mediocre , a somewhat pleasant and totally mindless diversion . There 's no real depth , excitement , or role-playing to speak of.Wait for the bargain bin on this one . It 'll be there soon .	-1
Just about everything they could do wrong ... they did wrong . The interface is absolutely awful . The characters move in this pokey slow manner that make you want to scream . Getting at spells goes through a multi level menu . The combat is almost exactly like the old turn based Pool of Radiance from five or six years ago . I take a shot , then you take a shot then he does , etc . Utterly lame . The adventure is completely linear . It gives you no choices and leads you by the nose . Often you do n't even have a choice of right or left since the dungeons tend to lead you in a line as well . When you level up the machine decides how to allocate your feats and skill points for you . Please , please , please save your money . Buying this would only encourage them to put out more garbage .	-1
I 'm thinking , 'Alright , Pool of Radiance is finally out ' . So I pay my 50 $ and drive home to install it . I chose Drive D , not C , but it 's still on my C dirve ? Oh well , let 's play.I 'm still waiting to play . You ca n't escape combat . That 's a big minus considering the monsters in the first dungeon are way more powerful than your whole party.Why ca n't I choose what skills and feats for the characters I generate ( which are still the only characters in my party ) ? The customising of characters is nil . I so much prefer Baldur 's Gate 1 and 2 even though I only get to create just one character . But those games are way more fun than this game.What 's with the movements ? My newborn baby moves faster than these guys can walk . Excuse me sir , do you carry any magic items ? No . You do n't really carry anything . I 'll just take my gold and leave.Basically , a big & quot ; THIS GAME REALLY STINKS , DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY , BUY HOOKED ON PHONICS 'CAUSE IT 'S PROBABLY WAY MORE FUN THAN THIS RPG ( IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ? ) .	-1
PoR has to be the most disappointing CRPG release ever . I played the original gold box games when they were released , and this does not live up to the legacy . There are numerous crash bugs , a tendency for the save files to become corrupted and unusuable ( wave goodbye to hours of play ) , a horrible user interface and the most unbelievably awful gameplay system I 've ever had to slog through . I imagine that SSI , before starting development on PoR , had two folders available : one for the best features of the gold box games , one for the worst.The devs picked up the wrong folder before starting.The combat is terrible . It amounts to waiting ( slowly , even with gamespeed set to max ) for monsters to make their way towards your party and then , just as slowly , attacking them . And SSI brought in the 2-part turn method which was definitely NOT one of the endearing features of the gold box games . It makes for redundant effort and a great deal of wasted time . On the other hand , I *am* getting a good deal of reading done while waiting.People have complained that comparing PoR to the Baldur 's Gate/Icewind Dale/Planescape : Torment run is unfair . I agree . It 's horrendously unfair to take a beta-code & quot ; game & quot ; which shows little to no knowledge of , to say nothing of love for , the D & amp ; D license and compare it to the magnificent efforts of Black Isle Studios ' products . It 's like setting a flea against Godzilla.PoR is the favoured acronym for this disastrous undertaking . Advance the last letter forward one letter in the alphabet and you 'll have a better idea of what this game truly is .	-1
I 'm really sorry if any of the developers of ROMD are reading this , but this game is a dog . DO NOT buy it . Go buy one of the Baldur 's Gate games instead , or wait for Neverwinter Nights . I was so disappointed by this game because it could have been so much better . As the first D & amp ; D 3rd Edition game out there , it had the opportunity to define the standard by which others would be judged . Instead , it failed to qualify as even remotely fun , especially in comparison to the Baldur 's Gate games.Plenty of other reviews talk about the numerous inexcusable bugs ( like the install/uninstall problems ) or the painful game play ( why exactly ca n't I send party members more than one screen away from the leader ? ) , so I wo n't get into it here . What I would like to know is : a ) how could the people who slaved on this game night and day for god knows how long not realize that the game was fatally un-fun ? b ) how could these bugs have slipped past QA ? So much potential . So disappointing .	-1
Let this be a lesson to all game companies : Take your time and develop the game fully . Rushing it out the door to take advantage of the hype results in a bug ridden game that ends up in the budget bin faster than the speed of light . Do not buy this unless you are prepared to be frustrated and send it back .	-1
I pop in the disc and select install . The game refuses to let me do a full installation because it says I do n't have 1 gig of space free on D : \ ( When I clearly have 5 gigs free ) . So , I have to do minimal install . I then finish installing it and go to play the game , only to learn that it did n't install on D : \ drive . Apparently , I need to download a patch just to install the game to D : \ . Wow , the creators sure messed up on something so fundamental . They must not have even tested the game because apparently , you ca n't install the game in any specified folder unless you download patch 1.1.Then I go to play the game only to see my characters walking at 2 miles an hour . I start it up with a paladin , barbarian , and rogue tearing the place up while my mage sits down and rests . I then realize that my characters do n't have their long swords equipped . This is odd because I just equipped those long swords . I look at my inventory only to learn that there is no long sword animation . I have the sword equipped but I ca n't see it because I guess the creators left that out or the minimal installation ( which I was forced to use ) must not have it . This pisses me off greatly . I then look around for quicksave . Where is quicksave ? I have no clue . You ca n't customize your controls or something . I then give up on the game to play Icewind Dale . The games have the exact same stories , and Pool of Radiance has so many problems that I do n't ever plan to play it again . Besides , if you do find a sword that does 585598250298 damage in the first dungeon , you know theres a problem .	-1
Not superb . Graphically superior than it 's predecessor Baldurs Gate , Pool of Radiance lacks the game play that BG held . I 've always said I would take a game that lacks in graphics if it makes up for it in Game Play , and BG did that , This game is mediocre at best . It is stable on my computer , I have yet to have it crash ( knock on wood ) so I 'll give it point for that , having a game for near two weeks with no crashes is pretty good . I 'll give it a point for graphics , as mentioned earlier they are great . I 'll give it a point for allowing you to create up 4 members of your party . Where does it lack , Game play as mentioned is poor , interface is tiresome , I guess the hardcore table top player geeks like it , but I ca n't stand the turn based combat ... . I turned it off . With Baldurs Gate Infinity Engine , it was customizable ... players could make their favorite sword from whatever book they read and through it into the game to be bought of found , one group even made a whole new add on for it , but I do n't see that this is as customisable , there for not very player friendly , so minus a point . If you are a BG fan , do n't buy it thinking you will get something like it , you wo n't . It does n't hold the interaction of BG , I like that , if I like running around hacking things up with little to no problem solving , I would play Diablo II . I guess SSI created a concept that had a following already with the original Pool of Radiance game , made a graphically great game so they could hype it up and then threw it at us .	-1
I have always had a soft spot in my heart for the first Pool of Radiance series . It was the first computer game to bring a great PC version of a popular RPG to fruition . I also played the Black Isle/Bioware versions of the AD & amp ; D series ( Baldur 's Gate & amp ; Icewind Dale ) and loved those games . But this one ? I think my review would be censored if I told you what I thought of this game.First of all , the game crashed on installation ! Blizzard may be the only software company that releases relatively bug-free PC games these days but how can a software company justify a game with bugs in the installation process ? ! I 've heard that I have it lucky . Some people have had their operation systems wiped out in the installation process.After getting the game to run , I was unimpressed . The graphics are decent but it does n't have the same atmosphere as the other recent Dungeons & amp ; Dragons products . It 's a & quot ; hack and slash & quot ; only game and things such as quests , great storylines and character interaction which made so many of the Dungeons & amp ; Dragons games enjoyable are non-existent in this product . The instruction manual is also a poor substitute for an introduction to the new 3rd edition Dungeons and Dragons rules.I 'm afraid that the more I play this game , the more technical errors I 'm going to find . There are already many bugs such as the game crashing when you save it during certain conditions . I can live with a bugged game if it promises to offer great gameplay when it is fixed with patches but this game is a pitiful attempt to live up to some of the great successes the Dungeons and Dragons series has seen with PC games.Do n't waste your money . If you 're an avid D & amp ; D fan , wait until the game price drops and then try it out but I 'd recommend Baldur 's Gate II as a much better alternative if anyone desires a great RPG game for the PC .	-1
This game is the biggest disappointment I 've ever seen , and being an avid fan of the Gold Box series , it doubly hurts.Beware at your own risk if you buy this one . And do n't even try if you are running 2000/XP . According to Ubi Soft , these are `` Business '' operating systems , and we should not expect to run their games on a business operating system.But I was asking them about XP Home ? Last I checked , that was n't considered by Micro $ oft to be a business operating system.It 's this arrogance and negligence by Ubi Soft that will convince me never to buy another game from them again.Anybody want an opened , unused version of POR ?	-1
... have i place such high expectations for a RPG only to receive a game that 's barely playable , i got it the first day out but there are now known technical issues with the release of this game . after 2 hours of playing , my saved games were utterly corrupted and the game crashed consistantly back to the desktop . i have to manually delete some files just to be able to play . other technical issues have been raised in various forums that i will not address since i will assume that a workable patch will be available by the time this review is posted ; instead i will mention the gameplay itself.graphically , the game looks nice but it only has one resolution of 800x600 so you see a limited view of your party 's immediate area . the pathing AI during combat is horrendous , often taking a longer route than necessary ... this sometimes leads to your character running by an enemy , giving them an attack of opportunity against you ; this can also negate your ability to attack -- depending on how far you need to move to an enemy , you may or may not be able to attack , taking a longer route even though it initially shows an attack icon means a wasted move . it 's also hard to position your character to score flanking attacks . the combat manual is almost too cumbersome , though hotkeying commands help.i like the point-buy system of generating your character 's ability score which is sanctioned by AD & amp ; D rules and a very fair way of managing your needs . but your character starting equiptment sometimes does n't make sense . your characters generally have a range weapon , a bow or sling , but no ammuno ... arrows are really hard to find and was not sold by the first trader you meet ( i have n't come across another trader/shopkeeper so far ) , yet most of the orcs you meet will launch arrows at your party.this game follows 3E rules but pre-determines each character 's feats , skills and abilities without input from the player . the characters does not appear balanced , the ranger for instance does NOT have the ability to use dual weapons ( no one can ) making the class much weaker than other fighter classes ; the favored-enemy is pre-selected ( at least on level one ) .getting to level 2 is fairly straight forward but getting from level 2-3 is TEDIOUS -- it feels like most of the enemies encountered rarely provide much experience points . sometimes the enemies seemed harder to fight because your characters are so weak -- at level 2 your will face shadows and wraiths and only one or two of your party will have magical weapons at that point ; once you are in combat mode , there is no way to retreat.since you HAVE to keep your party together , you also ca n't send one character to do advance scouting ( this oversight will be a huge disappoint especially if you play the multi-player mode ) .overall , this feels like an unfinished game that 's more of a dungeon crawler ( with lower resolution and much less loot ) than a true RPG -- the plot line so far is fairly trite . i am just severely disappointed that this game is linked to the excellent gold box series -- maybe it 's unfair to make the comparison but if you carry the name Pool of Radiance , you 've got to deliver .	-1
Pool of Radiance shows every sign of being rushed to market despite obvious problems in the user interface and serious bugs . It 's only redeeming feature is a turn-based combat system that is deeply flawed and the ability to save at any time which is very important.Let 's start with the boring and repetitive dungeons which look like they were expressly designed to antagonize the players . Long detours are required to travel between nearby locations . The automap is almost useless as it consistently shows openings where none exist ... . Frequently characters fail to take anything close to the obvious , direct route to their targets and consequently arrive there too late to take any further action . Often a character would walk through a cloud of death rather than take a shorter , clear route . However , the bad guys were just as stupid so I guess it evens up.The targeting algorithm is equally bad . All the characters are animated ( wings flapping , etc ) and even when the cursor is stationary they will move in and out of the target zone of an arrow or spell depending on which frame of the animation is being shown . Not only does this cause a problem when trying to target the character , but it causes problems when trying to target nearby characters , too . The angle of view also prevents you from targeting characters when there is a larger character in front ( from the viewer 's point of view , not the character 's point of view ) ... The non-combat part of the targeting algorithm is also flawed . Quite frequently it was impossible to persuade the group to move to the desired location because of the angle of view ( which can not be changed ) . There are also artificial restrictions on how far characters can look and travel both in and out of combat.You can arrange your party to travel in a particular formation . This feature does n't work . I had my fighters up front , thieves and clerics next , and my magic-user at the back . So why is it my magic user always seemed to walk into a room first ? I could n't get my fighters into combat until the bad guys had killed the magic-user because the silly sod was blocking the door . I wish there was a way for my fighters to kill the magic-user first.I lost several turns in each fight because the computer has a habit of ending your turns prematurely.It 's also unstable . During about 100 hours of play the system crashed or hung about a dozen times . It also pauses for up to five seconds at a time with annoying regularity . I would expect this from a FPS game , but not an isometric view . Diablo never hung once.All in all , this loses to Diablo in every way except the turn based combat ( in theory , anyway ) and the ability to save at any time ( which I really like ) .Two thumbs down .	-1
When I first heard they were continuing the Pool of Radiance series , I was very excited as there were some of the best D & amp ; D adaptations ever brought to the PC . They were intriguing adventures that finally implemented what seemed like the complete rules.Once I finally got it installed ( forced to install to C : regardless of directory chosen ) , I was sorely disappointed.This game is a sad hack and slash adventure in slow motion . The other reviewer hit it on the head with 'Diablo done slowly ' . You crawl through the dungeon , fighting groups of orcs after groups or orcs ( or skeletons , or zombies , or whatever ) resting after every fight and talking to almost no NPCs . Additionally , in order to compensate for D & amp ; D 's purposely slow leveling , they had you magic items like they 're throwing out pocket change . I have low level characters with some stats 20+ ( supposedly godlike ) because of the equipment they are wearing.The game seems pointless and less than thrilling . At least it wo n't flare up your carpal tunnel as much as clicker games like Diablo , but it 's the same type of game . The random adherance to the AD & amp ; D rules is frustrating , and this game does not deserve to be called D & amp ; D. Fortunately , they put 3 seperate intro videos into the load procedure , so I 'll constantly be reminded of who released this garbage and avoid their games in the future . I may continue playing after the patch comes out and the sound actually works . Until then , I 'm afraid to uninstall after reading the horror stories of people losing their OS during an uninstall.Avoid this game .	-1
As I continue to play Pool of Radiance , my opinion of it has grown steadily worse . This is the third review I 'm writing on it , and for the first time , I 'm wishing there was a '0 stars ' rating . As has been thoroughly pointed out , this thing is the ultimate bore . You will find raking leaves in your backyard more fun than playing it- I guarantee that.What 's more , since I bought the game I 've started playing pen and paper D & amp ; D , and I can assure you that this game does NOT follow the 3rd edition rules to any reasonable accuracy . The designers cut more than corners on this production , to the point that it 's more like a demo version of D & amp ; D.I 'll just list off a few things ( I 'm sure I 'll think of more later ) : -Weapons are restricted by class . They are n't supposed to be- anyone should be able to use anything , but sometimes at a penalty.-The wizard , druid , and bard classes are not included- probably the most glaring omission.-You are supposed to be able to choose skills , and a good three fourths of them are n't even implemented.-Spellcraft is actually supposed to be useful , because you can cast counterspells . You ca n't do that in Pool of Radiance.-A wizard is supposed to be able to cast on the defensive to avoid an attack of opportunity . No such thing here.-Enemies are only supposed to be able to make one attack of opportunity per round . In the game , it 's unlimited.-You are n't supposed to be able to critical hit or sneak attack an undead creature.- ( this should be obvious ) Pool of Radiance is missing about 90 % of the standard spell library . Included among the no-shows are such incredibly useful spells as mirror image , stoneskin , ANY summoning spell , ANY shapeshifting spell , and even most of the cantrips and orisons.-Clerics are n't supposed to cast spells like a sorcerer , save for either cure or cause wounds spells.-Clerics do n't get domain spells-Spellcasting is limited to sorcerer spells fixed per level- no empowering , extending , quickening , etc . No casting lower level spells from higher level slots.-The game is completely missing any and all combat modes save a normal attack and spellcasting- no tripping , grappling , disarming , etc.-You are supposed to be able to pick feats- and there are supposed to be many , many more.-Power attack is supposed to let you pick a number from your base and add it to damage . It only lets you pick max or plus half here.-Changing armor is supposed to take a long time . It 's a free action in the game.-Drawing a weapon is supposed to be a move equivalent action.-Invisibility is supposed to force an enemy to guess where you are . The enemies do n't guess- they know.-For some reason ( probably a bug ) sorcerers do n't suffer movement penalties for encumbrance.-You ca n't have a familiar.-You 're supposed to be able to maintain a 'Shocking Grasp ' spell indefinitely after casting it.-Cloudkill is supposed to do more than make enemies grunt ( another bug ? ) -They took the easy way out- there 's no resistance other than spell resistance.-Spell components are n't implemented ( I do n't mind this much , but some people do ) -Obviously , there are no skill checks other than finding and disarming traps.And after all this , I have also decided the graphics are n't even that good . I had thought them the only strong point of the game earlier , and now that I 've been further into it , I can assure you they are not . There 's simply NOTHING NEW as you go on- everything is the same tile of wall , same table , same barrel , et . al . Give me a break , UBI . I know you can do better than that .	-1
Why is it called Fast Food Tycoon when all I can make is pizza ? Hmmm ... Anyway on with the review ! Positives+ humorous , cartoony graphics make the game visually stimulating+ colorful and interactive menus help streamline choicesNegatives- abyssmal soundtrack and sound effects- help menus and context slow and annoying- game concepts are fuzzy and nigh impossible to master- even on easy modes the computer knows all the tricks- terrible and uninformative tutorialsOverall ... Fast Food Tycoon is a good idea with neat visuals but the implementation of the game is amateurish . It might be worth a few bucks but there are better tycoon games out there ... . Performance is fine - as long as your PC matches the recommended configuration you 'll be good to go . Disable any virus software or other background services if you have problems .	-1
Pros : Cute graphics ... $ 5 `` Bargain Bin '' at CompUsaCons : Confusing layout ! No instruction manual , Infuriating ... difficult to understand , time-consuming , Interface impossible to deal with , limited control , yadda , yadda , yaddaThe Bottom Line : Avoid it ! The jewel case will make a great coaster for the soda I 'm sipping while playing a REAL game . If your goal is to drive someone insane , literally , then this is the perfect gift . Otherwise , do n't waste your money.Summary : The Pros : The idea of it all . They potentially had something so good in this game.The scenarios . Easy , medium or hard as well as `` most income '' or `` Most popular '' or `` First one to make a million dollars '' . I liked the option of not really having any goal and just playing so that I would n't blink and be obliterated.You can check on how different `` target groups '' are responding to your restaurant , your food , etc . Click on the target group and a little Polaroid Photo sort of thing pops up and they 're either smiling or making a pre-vomiting face.The `` make your own pizza '' part ! Oh man this was fun ! You sort through all your ingredients and apply liberally . You have the traditional meats and cheeses and veggies . You also have all sorts of seafood and insect life . Ew , right ? Well , you open franchises in different countries and hey , tastes vary . What else is fun when you 're making your pizza is they have a `` Chopper '' . You can click your ingredient over the chopper and it 'll dice it smaller and smaller and it 's graphically correct and adorable . Cheese starts as a block ( chopper chopper ) and then it 's a thinner slice ( chopper chopper ) and then it 's small chunks , and then shreds , and then sprinkles . How cute ! Tomatoes go from whole to halves to quarters to slices to paste ! Fun ! The Cons : I 'm ashamed to say that I could n't figure out how to play this game for the life of me . Being impatient , I just jumped on in and thought I was going to kick some butt . After about 20 minutes I was still staring at the screen , clicking on various things.Aaaaalright , I 'll take the tutorial . It turned the light bulb on in my head in terms of staffing , decoration and purchasing supplies . Frustrating though ... I clicked on everything on the screen before I 'd click on what it wanted me to . The graphics are loud and confusing . What does a big face mean ? Staff ? Syndicate ? Exit ? Oddly enough when I started my next game I could n't find ANY of the buttons that were there in the tutorial ... I could n't find the staffing , my `` information history '' and could n't even figure out how to open my darn restaurant.Infuriating ! I checked out my restaurant ... it had some people and staff in it ... but when I clicked around it sent me to some other restaurant . I sure the heck did n't open that one or decorate it , where 'd it come from ? Argh ! You have the option of having things done `` automatically '' for you in various areas ( Select them when you begin your scenario if you 'd like ) but does n't that defeat the whole purpose of building your own Pizza Empire ?	-1
These things cost like 15-20 bucks and they only hold 15 games ! That is very cheap . If you are ever going to get a memory card for your PSOne , get the colored cheap ones that come in a 3 pack for 10 bucks . Thats what I got and now I can hold 45 games for less the price . Can you believe that ? 10 bucks for 45 games or 17 bucks for 15 games ? You choose .	-1
You can find one for a good 5 dollars at any local store . Completely avoid this 15 dollar rip-off .	-1
I did n't much enjoy this game , though I must admit that the graphics were TERRIFIC ! I suppose this is a great game if you you 're into ( as the young man at the game shop put it ) & quot ; Button Mashers & quot ; . . . A button masher , it seems , is a game in which the primary goal is to mash the attack button before the enemy hits you over the head with a mallet ( or some other unfriendliness ) .The crux of the game is that you 're one of the heros outlined in the opening credits . Each has a different weapon that they use in a different way from the next ( Et cetera , et cetera . Yadda yadda . . . ) . You have to win a series of battles ( that are a bit confusing to begin with ) and claim various prizes . . . Now on to how to play the game- ( much like the title of this review ) & quot ; Run around , whack buttons , repeat until you are dead or victorious & quot ; . Taa Daa , you 've just mastered Dynasty Warriors 2 ; Congrats . The only real strategy I 've been able to discern from watching 3 people ( aside from myself ) play the game is & quot ; do n't get hit & quot ; .Sorry to have been less than overjoyed with the gameplay , but I 've seen really good games and I 've seen really bad games ( I own 116 PS1 games and 16 PS2 games . . . ) and this one is simply too close to marginal to get all hot and bothered about . Rent it before you buy it . If you ca n't stand the idea of returning it to the rental store , buy your own . ( On the up side , I 'd give it 2.5 stars if that were an option )	-1
Because of what I consider to be a significant flaw , this is a somewhat superficial review of Armored Core2 . Armored Core 2 has great graphics and even , nicely designed missions , although it often requires you to repeat completly unnecessary dialogs and setup sequences even for repeat attempts that only serve to waste time . Aside from that though , it has what to me is a major and disqualifying flaw . The PS2 has really great analog controls . Armored Core 2 doesnt use them . They say they use analog control , but they only use the 2 analog sticks as single push buttons . How can you build a cutting edge mech fighter and not bother to incorporate one of the most significant features of the PS2 . This would be bad enough on its own , but the manual controls are extremely slow and ponderous . If something is shooting at you from behind , you can pretty well count on the fact that by the time you can get these hulking beasts turned around you are going to be toast or at least severely damaged . They also accelerate and decelerate with equal lack of alacrity . I might add , that the AI mechs that are attacking you actually appear to have higher performance than you can acheive in your own mech . It is a terrible shame that an otherwise really great game is so severely flawed by such inadequate control . The design it yourself mech feature is really excellent , and if it werent for the truly hobbling nature of the controls , this really would be a 5 star game . You will find my copy for sale online real soon now .	-1
... do not buy this game . Do n't rent this game , either . In fact , do n't even borrow it from a friend thinking , `` Hey , I 'm not paying any money and I have a few hours to kill , so what could I lose ? `` This is easily one of the worst RPGs I have ever had the misfortune to play . Ever . The plot is contrived at best due in part to an absolutely ATROCIOUS translation ( which ca n't settle on how to spell the names of important places/people ) . The psuedo-new-age music seems to be interesting for the first five minutes , but the utter lack of variety in the soundtrack had me wanting to claw at my eardrums so I would n't have to suffer through it any more.The battle system is very broken ; you could be standing right in front of a monster and still not hit it no matter how much you swing at the fool thing . The upgrade system you use for your equipment is also fundamentally broken . You need to repair your weapons and armor every few monsters you kill ; more often if you use the special abilities certain items grant you . And this is VERY expensive . I was so frustrated because it seemed like by the time I 'd killed enough monsters to recoup the cost of the last repairs , it was time to repair again.The only redeeming feature of this game is the graphics . Even though they 're a little crude by today 's standards , they 're still nice to look at in some cases . Also , the character model will change depending on your equipment , so your character could be running around with a pumpkin on her head or a metal pot on his head.Overall , it 's not worth it , though . I never once thought that I 'd get a headache just thinking about playing a game , but that 's really how bad I found this game to be .	-1
Evergrace first and formost was born to late , it may have been special if it was released 7 years ago , but it was not so here we have a PS2 game with ps1 graphics it 's a sure recipe for failure , then we have the sound by the way it 's not really sound it 's vernacular sound distortion.This not for a gamer maybe for a 8 year old kid who have never played any RPG 's it 's no zelda or final fantasy.However i kinda enjoyed this game so forget the bad review you can certianly give it a try , you may like it 's barbie appeal well laterz folks and gamers	-1
I do n't expect a game to blow me away with story , actors or any other things that goes into a movie . Because it 's a game . It 's just for fun . With that in mind I try not to rate games too harshly and also because there is usually some reddemming quality that I come away with that is good . But not this one . The game just starts . No intro , nothing to show what is going on or why . Just straught into a Blood omen clone that ... There is n't any story in the whole game . Just move from place to place and kill things . There is no real reason for it . There really is n't anything good in this game . It is years dated and uses nothing of the ps2 power . Metro 3d just put this sorry excuse for a game together and then hoped we the gaming community would waste our money on it . There may not be alot of rpg games on the PS2 but they are coming . Save your cash for the good ones .	-1
Every once in a while you just go ahead and buy a game without knowing anything about it and you are sorry you did . I have had this happen to me once before with a bad game called Deathtrap Dungeon . Well I referred to this game as Deathtrap Dungeon 2 because it 's another mistake on my part.And believe me , I am not all that hard on games . I want to like games and I want to have fun , but there is n't much good about this game . First off , as the other review noted there is no story . You start the game off right in battle , and you expect the story to pick up after that right ? Wrong . Think a story is going to show itself at the beginning ? Wrong . I have yet to see any story . The only story you will get is from reading the book.The game kind of reminds me of a Diabalo/Legacy of Kain : Blood Omen , except both of those games were good , and Dark Angel is not . If they would have just thrown in some good voice acting like in Legacy of Kain then the game would be so much better , but they didn't.The graphics are definately subpar . The menu screen looks like something that could have easily been done on the PS1 . Actually , the whole game looks like it could have been on the PS1 . The only part that seems above par is the sounds and music . But there is only so many times you can hear a monster grunt , or one say & quot ; You 'll regret that & quot ; after you wax him before that gets old.They say this game is an Adventure/RPG . I do n't see much RPG about it . There really is n't much freedom to wonder around . Guess my idea of a RPG is Phantasy Star , Summoner or Final Fantasy . On Dark Angel you point a silver cursor to one of the areas on the map then it shows brown dots go to that location . There is no getting attacked on your way to anything . Then all you do is crawl around level after level of some dungeon killing lots of monsters , picking up weapons or stuff , hitting switches , and sometimes killing some monster that gives you some item to fullfill a quest you got from one of the towns . Then you take the item back to the town and they give you some money . You also can collect items to take to these shrine things in the towns and they can raise your strength or one of your other attributes.The towns are pretty bad too . There is very few people in each town , and probably only two of them are of any use to you . Meaning , there are probably only two of them that you can get a quest from and buy and sell items.I see nothing original or good about the game ( besides the sound ) . And unless you really like just mind numbing dungeon crawling , then I ca n't really recommend this game to anyone . I can see this game coming down in price real quick because once some people get the word out about how bad it is , people probably wo n't be buying it too much.Please rent this game if you really feel the need to play it . Then decide whether or not to buy it , I have a feeling that after a few hours of playing it , you wo n't want to waste your money on it.Believe me , I wanted to like this game . I really wanted it to be good , but it just is n't . Please do n't make the mistake I did and buy this game because you think it 's going to be good , it just is n't .	-1
I 'm not going to give you many of my opinions on this game because there 's no point . There 's no shortage of opinion as far as how this game is . If you want to see how absolutely outstanding this game is , simply look at all the reviews below singing praises about this wondrous game . Let 's just say , if you like repetition ( I.E . Dark Cloud ) times 30,000 , you 'll love this game .	-1
I thought this game said it had something to do with vampires . I been fascinated with vampire lore for a long time and love some of the games that follow the old stories . I guess I was looking for more of a Blood Omen : Legacy of Kain or Soul Reaver slant but guess what no dice . This game was n't by any means hard or challenging . Total waste of what I paid for it in my opinion . The sound tracks were well done but the storyline left a lot to be desired . I am a pretty avid gamer and have a good knowledge of a game that deserves to be played or not and this one is almost no worth renting . There are far better things to do with your time no matter how pitiful your life is trust me . Skip it Move on and get over it before it consumes you completely .	-1
You are always told this as a child . Well its normally ment that a good book will have a bad cover . Well a bad game can have a good cover . This is one of the first games I got when I got my playstation2 a few months ago . This and GT3.Well I played it alittle bit and burned myself out on it pretty quick . How many times can I go to a dungeon for the same item . Gets pretty boring fast.This was a big Stink Bomb	-1
I would rather play the original Pong or Space Invaders ! A great big stinko goes out from me to Metro 3D . Wo n't be buying anything from these guys .	-1
this game is not exactly top notch , hell its lower than bottom notch . i must say that Armorines is just as fun as this game , and thats not good in any humanly possible way ... Graphics-6 : the graphics ar pretty bad , Anna does random and stupid stuff in the inventory but the backgrounds are done fairly nice . its a 3/4 overhead view so you cant see much detail on anything , but the sheer number of monsters that can appear on-screen at once is amazing . but with a little down scale on monster # appearance and background textures and a little down-tweaking on character smoothness this could have been done on the PS1 , and it would have been better.Replay-2 : if you have the gut to play through this for an hour or more your a brave man who desreves thousands of dollars and a memorial all to himself . if you can pick up the game , play it for 5 mminutes and see that it wreaks ... then your a human being . if you play through the game once , all the way , your godly.Story-1 : what kinda ... game has no story ? this one is a good example , you immediately strat off in a fight ina village , the game will pick up after that right , umm NO ! ! ! if you hate story i suggest getting this game.Control-10 : if you can tfigure out the controls you should be shot and dumped in the hoover damn , after that your remains shall be picked clean by seagulls.Fun-3 : sometimes of your bored beyond humanly possible reason you might play this for a quick burst of enjoyment while you hack up endless streams of invincible monsters for about 15 minutes before you need to go puke for every minute of gameplay . also you might wan na hit your head so you dont remember ever playing the gme as it will shatter your humanity .	-1
Mix the item finding and collecting of Diablo ( no uniques though ) with the endless hack and slash of the first Gauntlet arcade game , and you have this . Great monster and item variety . If you know what to expect , then you can have a lot of mindless fun with the game engine.Probably the best part of the game is defending the villages , with the villagers fighting along side you . I thought that part was inspired , as far as hack and slash games go.On the flipside , the game was rushed into fancy packaging without being complete . The story is minimal . It 's apparent ( I 'm not an excellent coder ) that twelve hours ( one work day ! ) of touch-ups on the story ( have the villagers say different things each month ) and a bestiary like Castlevania : Curse of Darkness would have improved the experience . I did n't like the game because the slapdash programming was so obvious.This also reminded of the original Legend of Zelda for the NES and Gateway to Apshai for Colecovision . You can really get into the exploring aspect of the randomly generated dungeons . I thought the music was pretty bad ... I mean rock and roll in a dark ages type adventure game ? Did n't do it for me.So you who are reading this review , ask yourself this : have you played throughBaldur 's Gate : Dark Alliance , Baldur 's Gate , Dark Alliance II *may be expensive* , Champions of NorrathORChampions Return to Arms ( Norrath one and two are essentially the same game ) , Castlevania Curse of Darkness , and the computer version of Diablo ( one and two ) ? If the answer is yes , and you liked them , you 'll like this if you do n't expect a story . If the answer is no , buy one of the better games mentioned , you 'll like it more .	-1
At first when I decided to play this game , I thought that it would be like Diablo , but was I ever , ever wrong . There was no storyline at all , the bird 's eye view was horrible ( I kept straining my eyes to see the characters , everything was so dark , except for that strange light that seems to illuminating from Anna , which I do n't understand where it came from ) and the music was awful . There would be loud pounding music one minute and all of the sudden it 's silent for a long time ... .Strange ... . The action was barely there , just run up to the monster and hack . It was n't even fun after the first 30mins . The graphics is n't even worthy of PSone ( maybe supernintendo ) . Dark Angel is neither an RPG game or is it an adventure game , I do n't know what it is ... except that it is boring ! I wish I could give it zero stars .	-1
No story , character , graphics , controls suck . All I can say is that I 'm glad I found this at EB Games for only $ 5 . If I read all the negative reviews on here first before I bought it , I still would not have spent $ 5 . That 's pretty bad when a game is n't worth that and this is one . I played it for about 15 minutes and I 'll never play it again . Do n't waste your time on this one .	-1
Warning : This program , like many other recent games ( form Microsoft and others ) , will ONLY run on an account that has administrator privileges on Windows XP or 2000 . That means that in most common home settings , school settings , or in public facilities with shared computers most users will not be able to play this game . If you have configured your home PC , for example , so that only you can perform potentially damaging administrative operations and have protected it from accidental damage by your kids by giving them `` limited '' accounts ( a recommended `` best practice '' you should certainly be following ) , your kids will not be able to play this game . Similarly , if you have configured computers in a school in the obvious way , with only certain staff given administrative access and all others limited to `` user-level '' access , then only the administrators will be able to play the game.Note that although I agree with the general consensus that Mech Warrior 4 is a fun game , my feeling is that it this limitation is a fatal one that should have been noted on the box ( it is not ) and thus I can not give this product more than a single star , because it simply does not work in scenarios that it should be expected to work , and there are no warnings to this effect anywhere on the box or in the documentation ... .	-1
I bought UT for the PC and played that game to death . When I bought my PS2 , since I like FPS , I decided to rent Unreal Tournament for the PS2 . Let me say this : whenever PC games move over to consoles , they fail 99 % of the time , and this is no exception.The graphics are horrendous for a PS2 game , unlike the PC version , these graphics seem muddy and unclear . The other falling points of this game are the lack of levels and characters , and no on-line play is the final nail in the coffin . Buy Timesplitters or the PC Unreal , save yourself from this turkey .	-1
Terrible terrible terrible ... very very dissapointed with sony . I actually bought this game for ps2 even tho i had it for the pc . The graphics r terrible , the controls r demented , and it is no fun without playing it with atleast 10 people in the same map with people all over the world , which is a very lacking point of this game.. dont waste your money and time buying this game ... get it for the computer ... it is cheaper than this one , it 's still played , and is a great game ... the pc game is a classic , the ps2 one is no more worth a pecan 's droppings .	-1
When you think Unreal Tournament you should think of a PC and not a console system . While FPS games have a chance on the console , just think about 007 for the N64 , it 's difficult to make a winner on the console experience . Unfortunately , UT does not make it into winner mode.Play control is n't bad . There are a fixed number of pre-set ways you can configure the controller , and not everyone will find one that 's acceptable . I prefer setting J which makes it almost identical Oni style controls and seems to me to be the emerging standard control for first-person games.The multiplayer mode has too many problems to make this game enough fun . The levels are all pretty small and pretty simple . There 's no network play ( though you can hook two PS2s together with an i-Link for 8 player fun ) , so you 'll pretty much max out at 4 people on a split screen forced to use the controllers.If you 're looking for a good multi-player FPS , I 'd save your money . It 's only a matter of time before some company makes one . It takes a little patience .	-1
compared to it 's PC brethren , this title is sorely lacking.No online play = no fun without multi-tap and 3 extra dual shock 2 's ... Ugly graphics compared to PC , or even fellow PS2 First Person Shooter : TimeSplitters.Slowdown . Lots of it . Especially in multiplayer . Do not play with more than one other person or you will experience some serious slowdown . It 's not so bad that you CAN NOT play it , but it is very frustrating considering how powerful PS2 is ! You should n't have to put up with slowdown with this kind of machine . If you 've played Perfect Dark , the slowdown is comparable to that game in 4 player mode.Horrendous controls . The game gives me a migraine every time I play it because for some reason the controls are n't fully customizable ... .	-1
Unreal Tournament may have done well on the PC , but for PS2 , it seems dull and uninteresting . Although you can confiugure the controls to slightly resemble any other PS FPS game , they do not have the configuribility ( I think I just made that word up ) that Timesplitters has , and with my backwards lefthandedness ( now I am pretty sure you wo n't find that one in the dictionary ) controller configurability is an esential . Once you get used to what the controls do , you still have to deal with the speed of the game . I know that it is more realistic to have people die when you shoot them , but one shot virtually decimating your health just means that you are going to spend half of the game trying to get weapons because someone shot you in the face when you were looking for a weapon , because you died when you were looking for weapons . Sound a bit repetitive ? Well , this game is repetitive.Another feature this game is missing , that I much enjoy is the ability to choose bots , not just four or five different skill levels , but really being able to pick who they are , and their individual skill levels.If you are unlike me , and do n't happen to mind a limited control over your game , maybe you will like this game , but may I also point out that several of the positive reviews for this game are for the PC version . Something is apparently lacking from the PS2 version , and since I have never played the PC version , I am unable to tell you what the certain something is .	-1
It is a good game overall , however , if you want a good creat of boxer this is not what you want . I for one WOULD like to have a decent creat a boxer . this one does n't even beat The Greatest Heavywieght 's creat a boxer . They had to scan in people which to me was a total bad idea.I hope EA Sports makes 4 Major improvements on 2002 version.1.ALOT BETTER Creat of Boxer ! maby a creat of manager/trainer/cut man . 2.Creat Female Boxers . 3.LARGER line up ! 40 All Star Boxers my ... ! Get back to the basics and allow a 30 rank Heavywieght league maby 34 so 4 other people can be on at the same time , and if they wan na pass you there gon na have to beat yah . and 4 . ALLOW defending the championship belt ! These are what keep Knockout Kings from becoming the greatest Boxing game ever .	-1
As far as I am concerned , this game is disappointingly boring and just the same Playstation1 game all over again , where is the gameplay . If I may suggest : DO N'T BUY THIS GAME Buy Ready 2 Rumble round 2 , Its better and more realistic .	-1
I was never a fan of the Playstation 2 controller . I do n't like the fact that the analog stick replaced the directional pad . Using an analog stick is annoying because you do n't feel comfortable with it . Ask any older gamer- they will tell you that you felt more in control of your movements with a directional pad . With an analog stick , you slide all over the place . In addition to that disaster , the PS2 controller also suffers from `` too many buttons '' . We should n't have to have a degree in rocket science to figure out how to successfully figure out and complete a game . The Playstation One had the best controller ever . It was comfortable , you were always in complete control , and it just looked better .	-1
Most have claimed it works on ps1 but this one does not for any of my ps1 games . Meh meh .	-1
Hell you need it to play games and that is the only reason you need one of these , third party controllers are better and not as flimsy but most wo n't work with your ps2 so your stuck with the duel shock 2 . My main problems with this thing is how breakable it you ca n't squeeze it to hard accidently drop it because it will break it has bappened to me many times , you must be really careful with it or you will be stuck payin the outrageous price twenty bucks which is too much for how breakable it is . Other than it works .	-1
This controller is undoubtedly the biggest POS ever made . Since the PS2 came out around 5 years ago , I have probably gone through over 20 controllers through normal play and not from getting thrown into a wall ( well , not until they 're already non-functional ) .What 's worse ? It 's the best one out there . I 've had no better luck with any aftermarket controllers.I wish I could punch the engineer who designed this craptastic pile of poop right in the eye .	-1
The Playstation controller is nice . However the Nintendo 64 user would remember that the N64 controller was just a snazzy , maybe even more so . The XBOX controller is like a brick when compared to both . The PS2 delivered on a vibrating Dual Shock controller as standard with the unit . This controller feels great with the thumb pads / thumb sticks allowing for all sorts of movement . Suddenly in 2005 , four years after the PS2 was released , games like Metal Gear Solid III : Snake Eater and God of War improve on this thumb pad function with the new mini-games feature . The controller has been given new life because of this.The big negative is the problem that Sony PS2 controllers are extremely poor quality . This controller , for all its design , will give you a dual shock . First of all you will be shocked at how suddenly they break . Drop it on the floor and you will easily damage the L1 , L2 or R1 , R2 wing buttons . Even if you do n't drop it the wing buttons will usually break in less than a year if you enjoy gaming . The next shock is going through so many of these controllers because of this design flaw . Adding up the cost of each controller I could easily have bought myself another PS2 and then some more . The cord also has an uncanny ability to just wrap around itself and kink . I have never seen one that managed to remain straight . Also when a button breaks it tends to release little pieces into the controller so even if you do n't need that button for the game the controller feels like it has sand rolling around inside of it.For all its handheld conditioning the controller is far from robust . I have used a very similar Logitech Cordless Rumblepad 2 for the PC that is the same design as the PS2 controller and that is a proper robust model . Just comparing the two side by side makes the PS2 controller look like it was developed in the USSR in the early 80s or something . The fact that Sony have done absolutely nothing to improve on the quality of their own generic PS2 controller is probably the reason why they have made so much money out of the PS2 unit . It is a way too expensive even if the controller was more robust . I hope Sony get it right with the PS3 next time . Make these controllers more robust please . The PS2 controller was always far from a quality device since its inception and is the only item that let the PS2 down badly .	-1
I ca n't get through the simplest of battles because the buttons on this controller are so iffy . Makes game playing a real pain in the butt .	-1
I hate this controller . It is so small and uncomfortable to hold . The analog buttons are placed in the worst spots . It is WAY too small to support the anolog buttons ( 2 Fat Black Blobs ) , D-Pad , Triangle , Rectangle , Square and X .	-1
so i got this controller and i thought it would work since it was like buying one from a store but i was dissapointed because this didnt work and i wont buy anything else from this seller .	-1
I unwittingly bought a PS2 , not knowing that I 'd get a god awfull small game controller . I used it for a month and now I ca n't hardly move my hands or my fingers . Do n't buy Playstation 2 . They 've ruined my future . I 'm writing this review right now by using a voice typing program that Microsoft published especially for people who 've ended up in my poor situation . ( P.S . buy an xbox instead , their controllers are much bigger )	-1
To all that purchase pre-owned products . Please make sure you know the item works , so you do not have to return it . This memory card that I just bought does not even work . I just had to go buy another one that actually does . I would advise that you purchase through a Amazon fulfilled vendor and not anyone else . My kid was so upset at the fact that this item didnt work .	-1
At close to ( $ price ) Sony 's official memory card is way overpriced . It probably costs them $ 2 or $ 3 to make it but we end up paying dearly . Unfortunately you should not buy third-party memory products ; none of them offers complete compatibility with the PS2 . Sony 's memory is slow , but at least reliable .	-1
First , there is nothing about this to really write home about . It is a memory cart . You have to have it else your PS2 is worthless as a game machine . Most games wo n't even play unless you have one , so you have to have one.My main gripe is the memory size . 8MB ? C'mon ! WRC and GTA3 both take up almost 1/3 of the capacity of this cart for their save games . And it is going to get worse.Where are the 64MB carts ? Save yourself some money and do n't buy this single pack . There is a twin pack of cards for only a few dollars more .	-1
Do n't bother with this one . This game is no way near as polished as Madden 2001 . I think the only people who will enjoy this game are those who are die-hard fans of the Game Day series . The gameplay , presentation , and style is actually very similar to the previous generation Game Days , but the game just goes downhill in terms of presentation and graphics . For the first time , there simply is no comparison between Madden and GameDay . Madden 2001 . Hands down .	-1
This game in one word ... ! Get the Madden 2001 and do n't even bother with this game . I got it and played it once and had to take it out . Terrible graphics and shotty game play . Bottom line , do n't even buy it !	-1
I 've been buying football games since the NES days . As the gaming revolution brought us more and more graphics , the difference between today 's games evolves around gameplay . GameDay 2001 is an average game at best . In the two times that I 've played this game , I notices several errors . First , my St. Louis Rams ' roster is a complete mess . They had my defensive ends lined up in the defensive tackle position and vice versa . They have the wrong personel returning kickoffs ( Phroel ) and punts ( bruce ) . The QB , when he steps back and throws the ball to the right , his arm slings left . It seems clear to me that 989 rushed to finish the game and they over looked many of the small details that are important to the & quot ; hard-core & quot ; gamers like myself .	-1
NFL Gameday 2001- Bad graphics ( Playstation 1 graphics on the Playstation2 system ) o.k . gameplayMadden 2001 The best graphics yet for anything ( even computer ) Has to be the best gameplay of any football game yet.I saw a review of NFL Gameday 2001 in a Playstation magazine ... .and it showed a picture of a quarterback throwing the football ... The football , as it left the quarterbacks hands traveled right ... .his hand was throwing to the left . WHATS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE ? ! I do n't like putting games down , but buy Madden 2001 first , then rent Gameday 2001 after ... .compare , then write a review for both . : - )	-1
If you 're gon na get this game , get on PlayStation if you have the original system ! The controls on GameBoy are next to impossible !	-1
This game [ is horrible ] . IT is so incredibly horrible that it makes ET on teh Atarii 2600 look good.FOr a PSX game the graphics [ are bad ] . The over the top view is fine but it looks like it could easily be on the NES ( Conviently trannsfered to Gameboy COlor by the way ) I hate the music in it . The same style makes for a non stop bore fest . I took it back within three hours after renting it.The controls are what kill it though . YOu will smashj the controller in three seconds after playing it.Avoid with all cost . Trust me , as a hardcore gamer for 19 years you will trust my advice and avoid , go for Grand Theft Auto 3 if any of the series .	-1
This game , in one word , is & quot ; bad. & quot ; It just does n't have enough going for it to get over 2 stars . It is a button smasher , and should NOT appeal to any real gamers who have any respect for [ their ] skills . If you have no skills and ca n't DO anything besides button mashing , I recommend this game to you , you loser with no reaction time and no idea how to play a game . But here : I 'll explain the generous 2 stars I 've given this game - it 's beautful . The graphics are beautiful , and so are some of the characters *g* , but that does n't ( and never should ! ) make up for the awful gameplay . Firstoff , there 's the awful slow control characteristic of fighting games . Then there 's the button mashing . Being a gamer who relies on speed , I brought me fast moves and strategy to bear on my younger sister - and I was demolished for it ! ! She literally set her controller on the ground and began to smack it , and she beat my arse ! My recommendation is against this game , no matter how sexy the girls and how good the graphics !	-1
I 'm primarily a 2-D fighting fan that decided to try this for cheap . I put it in for 3 season plays & just did n't like it . Maybe I 'll get around to it again someday & reviese my review but for now I 've got a NeoGeo Battle Colliseum tourney to finish & King of Fighters 11 lined up after that so it 's not a priority at all .	-1
Following the trend of Gundam games in America , Battle Assault is terrible . There are , though , two ways to look at it : as a Gundam product , and as a fightin game.As a Gundam product , the game is terrible , because Bandai should be pushing the Gundam Wing series further , seeing as its the only series televised . Their last minute replacement of the RX-78 with the Wing Gundam ( which , by the way , plays identically to the Zeta Gundam ) shows their desire to market the game in America to the Toonami show audience . The poor kids wanting to see Deathscythe face off against Tallgeese will be confused when they can choose from several mecha never seen in America.As a fighting game , this product is just plain awful . All of the gundams have identical moves , with identical button input , and it appears that most of the damage dealing system is based on luck . Poor area recognition is a problem , as is poor control . Bandai 's attempt at realism with slow-moving mechs only serves to make the game worse . The ammo system for the projectile weapons is futile and ultimately needlessly limiting . The plotline is ... ok , I wo n't start on the plot . The hidden characters are uninspired and not very useful or fun to play . The regular characters are horribly unbalanced , with several characters obviously stronger and more effective than other ones . The multiplayer is uninspired . The graphics are lacking sorely . The music is terrible.In short , this game would be good if it a ) had gone into development 4 years earlier and been released 2 years ago , b ) featured more characters , music , and themes from the Wing series , c ) been fine tuned and playtested before release , and d ) been cheaper . This game is n't worth $ 15 , much less $ 40 .	-1
I recall playing this game years ago -- almost a decade . This game featured a cool cast of characters , but that 's it.For Gundam fans , it may have been somewhat of a treat simply because of the cast of characters and the Gundam title slapped on ; however , this Gundam game is more like a slap across the face . The story is drab , the gameplay is a little uninspired and generic ( almost a copy of the older 2D Dragon Ball Z fighting games -- which were also pretty poor as well -- replaced with Gundam characters ) , the game is horribly unbalanced , and the voice acting was sub-par . This was the first in a line of three Gundam fighting games to be horrible and the trilogy goes downhill with each sequel.Pros : +Fun for Gundam Fans+Lots of GundamsCons : -Generic Fighter/Another Game Using a Known Name and attaching to a bad game-UnbalancedI highly only recommend this game to hardcore Gundam fans ... and even then , I warn you to rent the game first if you MUST try it out .	-1
Why is it when developers unleash a franchise game they tend to get lazy and contemptuous with their design ? For years I 've been waiting for a good Gundam game , so it was with great excitement that I launched into this game . What Bandai delivered is a game that has great visuals and a wonderful cast of characters from past and present Gundam series , but a fighting game that is lukewarm at best , absolutely horrendous at worst.Badly balanced characters is the worst aspect of this game . I 've finished the game with every character by now , but every time I have to fight & quot ; Psycho Gundam MkII & quot ; , it 's still one of the most unpleasantly ill-balanced fights I 've ever come across . I know some gamers equate difficulty with fun and unfairness with challenge , but fighting a computer character whose every hit takes off about eight times more energy than you do is n't exactly my idea of fun ( and I 'm not talking about a Psycho Crusher-style , one-time-only super move either ) . Even among the usable characters , Zeong ( possibly my favourite Gundam character ever ) and Quin Mantha are quite weak , but The-O is lopsidedly powerful.There are n't that many playing options , either -- the Vs. mode does n't offer that many more characters to choose from ; the Story mode has laughable , generic Japanese anime cliche dialogue ( & quot ; I 'm as tough as they come & quot ; , & quot ; I 'll destroy you & quot ; , etc . ) , and the ending is so flimsy I would 've rather not had any ending at all.Being a huge Gundam fan , I still give this game an extra star . Based on gameplay alone , this is a real stinker . The only point of recommendation is really for the characters . Sure , it 's fun to play as Sazabi or Zaku II , but does that make up for a very bad fighting engine , dirt-poor response and careless design ? Not for me .	-1
I 've had 2 PS2 's so far and none of the blue discs seem to play in them . The first PS2 I had I tried to play tribes that did n't work . Then my second PS2 I tried to play ICO . The graphics were good i 'll give you that , but my PS2 has a hard time loading everything up . I 'll give this game 2 stars overall because of the graphis in the cutscenes that I did see . As far as gameplay goes could n't tell you the thing would n't work . I recommend renting this game first to make sure your PS2 is capable of reading the blue discs .	-1
I wanted to like this game , really I did . I love fantasy , books , games , movies etc . And the concept for ICO is a good one . But man , this game is painfully boring , and slow . Its one of the most boring games I have ever played . For hardcore puzzle lovers only .	-1
I do n't really consider this a game . Yes , it is very different . But , what is good in diffrence is bad in gameplay . The princess can not climb chains at all . Ca n't she feel a chain ? COME ON ! The combat is stupid . Look at me ! I 'm hitting black shadows with a stick ! WOW ! The puzzles are interesting , but i hate that call that Ico has when calling for Yorda . SQUAWK ! Also , PLEASE TRANSLATE YORDA ! Maybe i 'm not a fan of puzzle games . Oh well .	-1
i got this game a few years ago ... many years after it came out . so many good reviews , but when i played it i wanted to hurt the people that made it and not allow the creators to do make anything else ( but they redeemed themselves withShadow of the ColossusA+ . Pointless adventure , worthless story , hideous game play . SotC is where this company shines . forget this game , get SotC.they might be coming out with a ICO/SotC PS3 upscaled HD game ... i recommend getting that only for SotC	-1
VMU games are the worst thing ever . I dont know why I thought this would be a good idea to buy because its garbage . It features grade school quality acting . Maybe you could consider it to be one of those so bad its good kinda things . In that case 11 thumbs up .	-1
This game was a very fast , easy , boring game . It was n't fun because most of the game was clips from the Star Wars movies . The only reason I gave it two stars was because it would show some excitment to young begining players .	-1
I HAVE READ MANY REVIEWS ON THE GAME GEAR AND I AM DISGUSTED WITH THE REVIEWERS WHO DID N'T DO ANY RESEARCH ( ALL OF THEM ) . THEY INSIST THAT IT IS SOOOO MUCH BETTER THAN THE GAME BOY ADVANCE . THE GAME GEAR IS TOO BIG TO EVEN FIT IN YOUR POCKET . IT IS REALLY BULKY . SURE , THE BACK LIT SCREEN IS NICE , BUT THAT ADDS TO THE SIZE AND WEIGHT OF THE SYSTEM . IT ALSO TAKES 6 AA BATTERIES AND DRAINS THEM EXTREMELY FAST . THE GAME BOY ADVANCE RUNS ON 2 AA BATTERIES AND LAST 15 HOURS . THE REVIEWS STATE THAT THE GBA IS THE SAME AS THE GAME BOY COLOR AND THE GAME GEAR IS A BETTER SYSTEM . WELL , HERE ARE SOME EYE OPENERS FOR YOU : & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; THE GAME GEAR CAN DISPLAY 4,096 DIFFERENT COLORS , 32 AT ANY TIME . THE GAME BOY ADVANCE CAN DISPLAY 32,000 COLORS , 511 AT ANY TIME . THAT IS MORE THAN A 25,000 COLOR DIFFERENCE. & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; THE GAME BOY ADVANCE IS 4 TIMES AS POWERFUL AS A GAME BOY COLOR AND 2 TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN A SUPER NINTENDO. & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; THE GBA CAN DISPLAY 128 MOVING OBJECTS AT ONCE . LETS LEE A GAME GEAR DO THAT ... HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE READ THIS REVIEW AND MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE .	-1
First of all , I must say that when I was a kid , I had ALWAYS wanted a Sega Game Gear ! ! They Kicked the Gameboys butt ! ! Color Screen , and an eight bit processor that was every bit as good as the internal processors for the sega master system ( actually almost identical , in fact , you can actually get an adapter to play master system games on a game gear , and the adapter dose n't even take extra power at all nor have any processors inside of it , it just directly adapts a master system cartridge to fit a game gear , thats it ) and to be fully honest , when you play some games that were made for the nes and the game gear both , most of the games look better on Game Gear , just to be totally honest . ( I 've had both systems , more on that later ) . One flaw in the system is the battery life . Not good ! ! It takes 6 AA batteries and this sucker will drain them in 4-6 hours ( in my experience ) one day , I was at a yard sale and low and behold , I found a Game Gear ! ! For $ 1 ! ! ! No Crap ! The sound did n't work , but it did work out of the headphones . Everything else was perfect ! ! I played on this game gear for quite a while until the headphones stopped working as well . I looked it up online and discovered this is an EXTREMELY common issue with game gears . It turns out that when the game gear came out in 1990 , there were a bunch of bad capacitors on the market at that time . Most of the game gears got these bad capacitors , not all of them , but MOST of them . I must say , that I do have a very extensive background in electronics , ( I majored in computer hardware design and repair in college . ) So I immediately replaced all of the capacitors on the soundboard of the game gear . The speakers started working immediately , and the headphones started working great as well . In fact , when I got done with the system it was very LOUD out of the speaker ! I bought probably 20-30 games for the game gear and loved 70 % of them , then I started notticing that the screen was getting almost impossible to see . You had to hold the thing at a very odd angle in order to see anything , and the contrast had to be all the way up . I looked this problem up as well , and guess what . When you replace the capacitors for the screen , you really must replace ALL OF THE CAPACITORS IN THE ENTIRE GAME GEAR in order to get it to work properly ! ! ! I did this . For the longest time , I would even take my game gear to pawn shops just to show it off , time after time I was told `` this is the best screen I have ever seen on a game gear '' and `` I 've never seen one of these work so well ! ! `` I would ask how much they would give me for it , and I heard anywhere from 70-80 dollars . I loved the game gear , for another year if that ( or 6 months ) when the screen went out again . It was perfect after I replaced the capacitors , even better than the nintendo ds screens in terms of clarity and brightness in my opinion , now the thing was n't working . So I opened the thing up one more time , to see that the screen was leaking fluid ! ! Guess what , This is common as well ! ! Just replace the screen for 40-50 dollars for a good one ! I gave up on it ! So basically , I do love the system , but do research on it ! Not all of them have these problems , but MOST do ! ! If you have , or buy a game gear that has the sound going out of it , all of these other things WILL happen as well , its just a matter of time ! It may last a few years , or maybe just one year like mine did , but as I said earlier , do your research !

I bought one when they came out , and they were better than the gameboy and gameboy color , but not gameboy advance.The GBA has a sharper screen , much better graphics and sound.It is smaller and more comfortable , takes less batteries and lasts longer on those batteries . Also I do n't know of any game gear games that are 3 and 4 player capable , so you could n't ( and certianly never will in the future ) , play awesome multiplayer games like Mario Kart , Mario Advance , Advance Wars , Doom , and the new Zelda game with 4 player support ( I forgot the name of it . ) It really makes no sense why anyone would want one of these nowadays , unless your really poor and ghetto ...	-1
This game is has many things wrong with it . First of all , the controls are some of the worst that I have ever seen . There is no smooth movement in Oni . It is very choppy , making it hard to control your character . Second , the camera angles are horrific : there are parts were the camera decides to zoom and unzoom , especially when fighting and it makes it very hard to see who you are fighting . The graphics are halfway decent but nothing worth looking at . The best thing about this game is that I kept the receipt .	-1
This game is very strange . I 've never seen such strong elements in an overall pretty lousy game . With the & quot ; strong elements & quot ; I mean the fights . These fights cause a huge adrenaline-rush . There are a lot of moves and it looks and plays very good . But there are a lot of bad things about this game ... For example , the overall gameplay is very bad . 18 levels long you 'll have to pull a switch , go through an opened door , whack some baddies and pull a switch again and go through a door again and ... you get my point.This game has also got one of the worst save-options ever known to mankind . The game saves automatically at certain points , but you 'll have to complete the level because if you restart the game the save-points are gone ! This is only done because if you could save yourself you 'll finish it in about 8 hours . But there 's something even worse ... after completing 10 levels I took a break and when I came back I accidentally pressed & quot ; new game & quot ; . No problem , I thought , just load my old game again , but ... The $ ^ $ # & amp ; # & amp ; ^ # game ERASED MY SAVES ! ! ! The whole city trembled of the scream that left my mouth ( hmmm ... maybe only the neighbourhood ; ) The graphics are not bad , but very boring . The levels are completely non-interactive.It 's a shame that Bungie put such a beautiful fightingsystem in such a lousy game . So ... do n't buy this game ! ( ... . )	-1
Oni should have a lot of appeal : it 's got a pseudo-anime look , well-done 3D characters , a great hand-to-hand fighting system . Unfortunately , it 's got a horrible aiming system for many of the guns , an idiotic save game system , and wildly varying difficulty . And the character design for Konoko in the anime opening is 1 ) ugly , 2 ) varies within the movie itself , and 3 ) looks nothing like the character as drawn either on the box or the 3D polygonal Konoko . Most of all , this game has none of the gameplay magic found in Bungie 's other games , particularly Myth and Myth II.A little explanation of the problems . The save game system is easy enough : you do n't know when it 's going to save , there are relatively few save points , and the save points frequently do n't tie into the game world , so you 'll be stuck fighting some difficult point over again if you die . The aiming system for guns varies with the gun , but for the pistols and submachine guns , it 's virtually impossible to hit anyone ( thankfully , that 's true of the enemies , too ) . There 's also almost no ammo to be found in the game world . It 's easier to lure enemies around a corner and go hand-to-hand . More fun , too . The difficulty level is annoying : at first , it 's pathetically easy ; later on , you start facing three or four enemies , some of whom appear out of nowhere while you 're fighting.Frankly , Bungie bungled this game . Coulda been great ; came out poor .	-1
I 've never played the original Gangsters but I 've heard enough horror stories to know what was wrong with it , but despite all the flaws people complained of everyone still seemed to enjoy the original . So when I saw the sequel on the store shelf I thought to myself that it would probably have all those flaws improved upon while still keeping it 's great strategy elements . So I bought the game hoping to be able to live out my favorite scenes from the Godfather . At first the game was amusing , but after those quick 10 minutes , the game was quickly repackaged and returned ! First off , the strategy elements of the game are completely gone ! Everyone used to complain about the micro-management in the first , so I guess the solution was to completely erase all management . You 're basically told what business to buy and it just generates money.The graphics are a bit cartoonish , but fitting . Although the graphics are n't realistic or polygonal they match the theme of the game and give it the appropriate feel . Unfortunately , that 's all this game has ! Good looks , good packaging , no substance ! The gameplay is terrible ! You 'll pull your hair out as you order your goons to drive two blocks away and watch him circle around the whole neighborhood before finally going to his destination ... and hopefully he 's not there to do a drive-by ! The drive-by shootings in this game are just ridiculous . You 'll quickly despise watching your thugs drive past , shoot , make a U-turn , drive back , shoot more , make another U-turn , shoot ( you get the point ) . That does n't seem like a very effective drive-by to me . Also , the people standing on the side walk never EVER take cover , they just stand there shooting at the car until they are FINALLY gunned down . What kind of dumb gangsters are these anyway ? The AI definately needs improving ! Also , do n't get your car ruined . If you do , then you have the option of stealing your enemies car , but only HIS car . What sense does this make ? My thugs have no problem with gunning down police officers but they refuse to steal an innocent person 's car . I had to run 4 blocks ( past rows and rows of perfectly good parked cars ) to my enemies hideout to steal his vehicle . But basically what I am saying is that the AI in the game is pretty stupid.Another thing that ruins the gameplay is the tedious and repetative missions . The game is basically open this shop , do a hit on this guy , buy that building , place guards here , do a hit on that guy ... over and over and over again . And although carrying out a & quot ; hit & quot ; should normally be enjoyable , as you can tell from my paragraph above I found killing people to be quite the chore.So if all of the micro-management is now non-existant and all of the action is absolutely horrendous and silly , what does this game have to offer ? Simply put ... boredom . The game is just too easy , too simple , and too shallow . Perhaps for the third game they should eliminate the tedious missions and make it more open-ended . Just allow you to hire thugs and build your empire . Also , they need to work on that AI a little . Why do these guys get lost in a neighborhood that 's 5 blocks wide ? And who ever heard of circling back around , better yet , making a U-turn while doing a drive-by ? You 're supposed to shoot and then high tail it outta there ! Basically , it could have been a good game had they taken the time out to actually add some gameplay to it .	-1
I am an avid Myst/Riven/MystIII fan . I bought realMyst to see the advanced graphics added to it..ie : Day , Night , Rain , Sun , and special effects . The game is really choppy . I even advanced my system , but it didnt help . I believe you shouldnt have to go any kind of frustration when playing a game and this one had a lot of choppiness and delayed reactions even after I upgraded my system . Too frustrating .	-1
Do n't get me wrong , I consider myself to be a pretty die-hard Myst fan , and I love all of my fellow reviewers with as much of my soul as I can muster , but I feel the need to issue a complaint about this wretched piece of junk that calls itself a game ! When I first saw Myst , I thought it was the most amazing thing I had ever laid eyes on , I was reminded of La Jetee , the old Chris Marker film in which we are given thirty minutes of still photographs telling a love story across time , space , death and reality . The film as well as the game opened the door for a whole new kind of narrative , one that was not reliant on the spectacle of motion . So , when I saw and purchased this game , I was weary of its potential offense . My weariness was not in vain as I asked myself : DOES IT NEED TO MOVE ? Just because a picture is worth a thousand words does not at all mean that fifteen or more pictures a second , sixty seconds a minute , sixty minutes an hour , nine hours a typical playing session does not mean that the game is worth up to and including 500 million words ! Frankly , I can only think of two : PURE DRIVEL ! Anyone ever hear of the Kuleshov Effect ? The Homeric Exposition ? The Triptych Manifest ? The Neurological Function of Visual Closure ? No ? Well , basically they all refer to your brain 's ability to put two and two together to make four . You see one image immediately followed by another without viewing any of the action that exists between them , just like when in a movie our POV changes from one character facing right to another character faving left . This make sense to us because , by our brain 's ability to fill in gaps in the action , we assume that these two characters are looking at each other.What , you ca n't tell what has happened between two images of a library in which one image shows the library-as well as its surroundings-as appearing closer to you in the frame than in the previous image ? YOU 'VE MOVED FORWARD , ( ... ) Okay , perhaps I 'm being a little too cruel , but it just annoys me to no end that there are those out there who feel that making still images move ( rather than simply appreciate the beauty they present to you in stillness ) somehow enhances the visual awe of art . Maybe if you have only a passing interest in the Myst mythos , and you enjoy solving puzzles far more than viewing such fine specimens of computer aesthetics , perhaps you will enjoy this game , otherwise , stick with the original and its sequels.I 'm sorry I was angry , it 's just that , as a filmmaker looking to altnerative , mold-breaking techniques of entertainment , I felt the need to uphold the integrity of the Miller Brothers , and the good sir Marker .	-1
I had never played Myst before and I wanted to give it a try because of its popularity . My biggest gripe is that the game offers no options . Every game I know of allows a player to customize the controls . I always use the inverted mouse look -- pull back , look up ; push forward , look down . I use this in Quake , Unreal , Thief II , Hitman codename 47 , Forsaken , System shock 2 , Half-Life etc . etc . Real Myst does not give me a choice , and I am not going to change my personal style for one game . The mouse is too sensitive , and there is no option to adjust it ( as in other games ) . The & quot ; walk & quot ; mode is way too fast . So , just try playing a game where you seem to be running all the time , the mouse operates backwards , and is too sensitive in its left to right movement . Well , I can just stand there and admire all the scenery , I guess.My system is a Dell XPS B733r ( 733 Mhz coppermine , PIII ) with a geForce 256 , 64MB DDR RAM 3D card , 128MB RDRAM , Soundblaster Live audio . Actually , the music in the game is very nice , and the graphics great .	-1
Great concept , but if you do n't mind the game play slowing you down because the playstation ca n't keep up ( oh and by the way the person you are chasing does n't slow down ) then its a great game the will just frustrate the hell out of you .	-1
Driver 2 is a poor game for the Playstation.The Wheelman is back in driver 2 for playstation and who truly cares about it ? Why this game was produced for the Playstation is beyond me . This is a game that is meant for the PC and not the limited processor of a Playstation . I saw the difference in the orginal Driver for Playstation and Driver for the PC and the gameplay experience was completely different . I 'll wait for the creators to code Driver 2 to the PC , so we can actually enjoy the game . The graphics are horrible , horrible and horrible . Anyone who says the graphics are excellent must have some bad eyes or have never seen any other game system besides a playstation much less a computer . During the Gameplay it is very apparent that the coders of the game did not fully optimize the game for Playstation as you can see in many parts of the game where the framerate drops . The framerate drops ? What the heck is this on a Playstation ? I have not seen any processor or memory upgrades for a playstation , so why would a game I am playing be too much for the playstation to play without any errors or holdups much less framerate drops . This is totally ridiculous ! I have a very good feeling that the creators of Driver 2 made a PC version first then coded it back to Playstation format which would explain the buggy and slow gameplay in some areas . I do have to admit the game is very fun to play and would be even more enjoyable if the game would actually be better than the orginal . The mission are very good and you can pass them easily if your gameplay does not slow down , but if it does you will be pushing the restart button after you fail the mission . The cutscenes are ok and I just love the beginning scene where the man with the sawed off double barrelled shot gun fires off about 8 shots without reloading , very clever indeed . RENT , do buy this game unless the only thing you have in your house is a Playstation . And if I see a Driver 3 for playstation , I might just drive myself into a wall in frustation .	-1
The frame rate is realy bad , and the pop up is pure death ! Auto Destruct was a good game , it came out in 1997 , but it did n't have this much damn pop up ! The first Driver felt like it was based in th 70s , but this felt like it was based in the 90s , but with 70s cars . It 's just ugly ! I 'll sell it , if I can find anyone who wants it !	-1
Little phrases describe this game better than & quot ; waste of time & quot ; . Once players get past the needlessly lengthy ( and unskippable ) 2 minutes of opening cinematics , they 're 'treated ' to some of the worst gameplay , realism and overall fun on the otherwise fantastic Playstation console . Each level is filled with unnecessarily difficult quirks , ranging from invincible opponents to hidden obstacles . A picket fence now has to power to halt a speeding automobile dead in its tracks , as does a small dumpster . One level asks you to 'highjack a truck ' , getting to mention that this 12 ton hauler can out-accellerate and handle your 2-ton sports car . Adding to the & quot ; fun factor & quot ; is the unwavering , needlessly impervious opponent that starts directly behind you , pushing you out of control almost instantly . As a sort of cherry on top , you 're given a time limit . What fun . I enjoyed the original Driver , and found myself hoping for something similar here . Alas ; no such luck . Do n't make the same mistake I did ... you 'd be better off spending your money elsewhere .	-1
Driver 1 is one of my all time favorite games so of course I went out and bought Driver 2 as soon as it came out . When I played it I could n't believe that this was made by the same company that made the first outstanding game . The graphics are hardly impressive , the control is loose , the speed is sluggish and it 's just not a user friendly game . At some points you end up hating the game because you have to restart so much each time you fail a mission . They made this game extremely hard . My friend is a gaming fanatic . He plays games all day everyday . He 's an expert at them . But even he could n't get past the first disc of this game . We 've both given up . Now , if I 'm going to play Driver 2 it 's just for the free drives around the cities . I 'm looking forward to a Driver 3 on Playstation 2 but I hope Infogrames will fix all the problems this sequel had .	-1
This is a review of this product : Driver 2 ( PlayStation video game ) . Amazon may display this review on the page of another version of this product , for which this review may not apply . After reading this review , please click on the link so that you can be assured that the product this review applies to is the same one you thought it was for . ( This is a review that I originally wrote on 07/27/2002 ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I *LOVE*Grand Theft Auto 3 ( for the Playstation 2 ) and I wanted a game that would be similar to it . I know that no game , except for possibly GTA4 , could even come close to GTA3 , but I still wanted `` more . '' From what I read about this game , it seemed like a poor man 's GTA3 . I hadDriver 1on thePC , but could never actually play the game itself because I could not pass that stupid driving test at the beginning of `` Undercover '' mode . When I read that Driver 2 did not have a driving test , that gave me even more reason to want it.GAMEPLAYWhen I popped the game into my PS2 , I immediately went into `` Free Ride '' mode so that I could get a feel for the controls and check out the scenery a bit . I did n't even move one inch when the cops were after me . Yes , that 's right , I was STANDING STILL and the cops were on my b-u-t-t . If the cops are going to be on me like white on rice , I 'd at least like to know WHY . I gave the cops no resistance , allowing them the chance to come up to the car and pull me out ( like real cops would , and those in GTA3 ) , but they thought it would be best to just keep ramming me ! ? ! Since this game lacks the Police Bribes and the Pay And Spray of GTA3 , the only way I could get the cops off my tail and reduce my felony meter ( the equivalent of GTA3 's Wanted stars meter ) was to hitail it out of there in the hopes that I could lose them . Even though the game promises that you can wipe your felony meter clean by getting out of your vehicle and carjacking another one , since you ca n't get out of the car and switch vehicles while being wanted/chased , there 's no practical use of this `` feature . `` I decided to try the main `` Undercover '' mode , hoping that it would be better . The first mission was simple enough . Get from point A to point B . The first time I tried it I failed it because I did n't get to the place on time ( I was going the wrong way from the start ) . Once I figured out that all I had to do was make two lefts then go right every chance I could , I got to the destination with time to spare . Mission 1 Passed ! Perhaps this game WOULD get better ... until Mission 2 , that is ! Mission 2 involves you having to follow another car . The problem is , unless you 're ( at most ) two car lengths behind him , the game will say that you lost him and thus failed the mission ... even though his car is clearly visible on the screen ! After attempting this mission three or four more times , only to get as far as around the corner , I had enough punishment and immediately decided to bring the game back to the store with my Mom 's receipt to get a different game . ANY game would be better , even Barney The Dinosaur ! Not even cheats codes could help make this game playable . I used two Game Shark codes to unlock the in-game Invincibility and Immunity ( no felony ) cheats . However , neither of these would help with mission 2 . The Infinite Time Game Shark code would not work , otherwise I *might* have had a chance of barely playing the game ... the key words there are `` might '' and `` barely . `` GRAPHICSThis game has the WORST graphics ever seen in a video game of any age . Pong and Pac-Man look high-tech compared to this.There is more pop-up in Driver 2 than in a marathon of Pop-Up Video on VH-1 . You look ahead and see an open piece of land . You plan to cut across that land in order to make the turn at a high speed without having to slow down ( or just to take a shortcut ) . Just as you get within a car 's length of that land , a building pops up out of nowhere . BAM ! You crashed and damaged your car . Repeat indefinitely and you 've got the graphics of Driver 2.REPLAYABILITYIn order to have replayability , a game must first have playability.TO BUY OR TO RENT ? NEITHER ! I would n't even give the CD to my dog as a chew toy.If it were possible , I would have given this game a 0 rating . Then again , it kinda deserves the 1 because it has one redeeming quality : it makes a great coaster !	-1
Driver 2 was a good game when it came out . However , now that Playstation 2 and Grand Theft Auto 3 have been released , there is literally no reason to bother with this game . The graphics look bad , even for PS1 . The frame rate is choppy , and the missions are so ridiculous that you will find yourself doing them over and over again . There are many annoying glitches as well , like falling through the street for no reason ( game over ) , and cops that smash your car over or through walls and buildings , trapping your vehicle in them . Also , the vehicles seem to drive VERY SLOWLY on the streets . pedestrians run from your car to avoid being hit , and if your car does hit them , they pass through the vehicle as if through thin air.I will give some credit to this game -- the & quot ; take a ride & quot ; feature allows you to drive freely through very realistic renderings of Chicago , Havana , Las Vegas and Rio . The cops , however , will chase you for no reason and smash your car until it is destroyed -- that is unless you can outrun them .	-1
This is a wicked bad game . Its its also wicked hard . Basically all you do is run a round like a mad man and kill things . Sounds fun . Guess what . ITS NOT . I mean you have to repair your weapon ! ! What the heck is that all about . And theres boxes that you open and they turn into ENEMYS ! YUCK !	-1
`` Zelda Killer ? '' Only if that means copying Zelda in every way imaginable can make it superior . `` A league of its own ? '' Not exactly , file this one with Legend of Dragoon as a predictably unoriginal , mediocre RPG . If you 're looking for that game that will pick up this slump of good software for the PS2 , you 'll have to wait even longer.Now let me clarify this : I have not played Zelda 64 nor do I own a N64 . I did not hear about how this was going to be a copycat of Zelda until I finished reading someone else 's review a few minutes ago . That said , I still felt like I was playing a rather effortlessly made copy of it . For sheer curiosity , I tried Zelda at a friend 's house . Even the grunts Link makes in-battle seems to be stolen from this game.What is the gameplay like ? For `` Zelda-virgins '' such as myself , it was pretty good at first . It was easy to jump into , and hard to put down for the first 5 hours or so . Good , until , after quite some time in the game , nothing really happens in the storyline ( a Sony RPG trademark ) and after hours upon hours of repetitive gameplay ( yet another Sony RPG trademark ) , it failed to keep me within its grasps.The graphics , while good , are nothing spectacular . They quickly get tiresome when you 're in the same dungeon for 5 hours or more . Every level of the dungeons look the same , so if you have a high tolerance of environments as repetetive as the gameplay , you 'll have no trouble there.And here 's another staple , the immense amount of typing errors , the third sign of a Sony RPG . While there isnt much text , it was enough to make me want to send money to Sony to buy a spell checker for the sake of pity.Georama is almost innovative . It would be if Sim-City had n't done this general idea first , and if it gave you more freedom . The villagers are very picky as to where their house should be placed . So picky that you 'll wonder why Sony even bothered to let you build these villages at all.In general , buy this if you liked `` Legend of Dragoon '' or if you 've never even heard of the Zelda series .	-1
I can not believe how high a rating this game is getting . This supposed `` Zelda killer '' is nothing more than a dungeon crawl along the lines of Evolution on Dreamcast . Zelda tramples this bore into the dirt . It 's got many similarities to Evolution : randomized dungeon levels , repeat visits back to town to restock on supplies so you can go back to the dungeon , bland enemies , that feeling of inane repetition . As for combat , where 's the strategy ? Where 're the backflips , the dodges , the ability to take out an enemy in more than two fashions , the feeling that you 're actually in the middle of a fight instead pressing one button a lot ? Basically , you either combo them to death , or you use your charge up super move . Dungeons are bland . Basically , it 's a bunch of rooms connected by tunnels . There are no puzzles or unique obstacles that have to be dealt with . There 's no sense of discovery , no `` Aha ! '' moments that are the great moments of Zelda style games . Every dungeon just feels like a dungeon . You 're not discovering whole new worlds filled with nooks , crannies , and secrets waiting to be found , you 're dungeon crawling , looking for loot and the key to the next level so you can do it all over again . Gameplay is repetitive . Venture to the dungeon , find the mystic balls and key , go back to town , build ( which does have a minor appeal to it ) and get supplies ( did I mention your character has to have a drink of water every three minutes ? Or that his weapon starts to wear down and break after killing five or six enemies ? ) , venture to the dungeon and find mystic balls on the next level which looks exactly the same as the first . Ugh , ugh , ugh !	-1
Before the game was released , everytime the name & quot ; Dark Cloud & quot ; was mentioned , you 're bound to see the name & quot ; Zelda Killer & quot ; in there too . Well , I 'm sorry , but it 's not . Zelda , has a better story and better gameplay . Ture , the & quot ; georama & quot ; feature is cool , you get to build your own towns and place anything whereever you want but it 's just not enough . Most of the game , you 're going through dungines , looking for the pieces to build the towns . This could have been tolerable it the dungines had different looking rooms . They do n't . They graphics are n't what you would call a second generation . They would have been more impresive if this game came out when the PS2 first came out . Zelda is so much better because Zelda had so much more to do than just dungine crawling . It had a bunch of secret things and mini games , and it had a big world for you to explore . Dark Cloud has none of that . There is n't even an overworld or whatever you call it . You just go straight to the towns . And in each town , you have to find the stupid pieces and rebuild the towns , then repeat the process . Now , for the combat . It 's totally like Zelda , except you constantly have to go and buy repair powder because guess what , your weapons have a ceratain amount of hits before the break and disappear . Also , you constantly have to go and drink water because you get thristy . Sure , it 's realistc , but we get games to escape to a fantasy , to do things we ca n't do , and to have fun . You want thrist ? Go run 20 miles non-stop . The characters do n't look unique at all . The main character looks like Link except for the hat . And the flying god looks like the flying dog from the Neverending Story , if you 've ever seen that movie . This game was interesting for the first 30 minutes , but when I saw what you basically have to do for the rest of the game , it got old pretty quickly . I suggest you rent the game before you see if you can look past all these cons .	-1
I ca n't even really say this is a fake Zelda , because they tried to copy and came up with a repetitous counterfeit . Over 100 hours of the same thing , over and over again . I maxed out my sword and did n't even get a reward . I would n't wish this life stealer on my worst enemy , that 's why I through it in the garbage . Negative -5 and yes , I beat it . Ocarina Of Time a positive +1,000 stars .	-1
This was a BAD game . Graphics were sub-par . Gameplay was easy . After one weekend of playing , I almost completed everything . For an RPG , give me a challange , please .	-1
This game is absolutely horrendous . You go back and forth to the same ugly looking dungeon looking for georama pieces . On top of that he gets thirsty every 30 seconds and is sword breaks which makes it weaker . Very very annoying . What is up with the building of the town ? I want to play an RPG not sit there and build a town . If I wanted to manage a town I would go play Sim City or something like that . I bought this game a while ago , and played for a total of about 2-3 hours before saying & quot ; screw this & quot ; and shelving it forever . I recently bought a game called ICO , which is also made by Sony , now that is a masterpiece ( Sony 's redemption ) . This is a horrible title , go buy ICO instead you 'll be happier ... trust me .	-1
I 've played dozens of games in the this genre , and while this might have been great in its day , every mechanic in Dark Cloud is done better by another title I 've enjoyed more . Compared against other mystery dungeon runners on PS2 , The Nightmare of Druaga is much better , and Baroque just blows this game out of the water on style points . If you are an adult gamer who likes sci-fi , and wants a unique mystery dungeon experience , buy Baroque PS2 instead . `` Repetitive '' is the game 's theme . Graphics are n't varied -- only tunnels and the same rooms , with no secret tunnels/areas that make the genre surprising and enjoyable . ( Azure Dreams on ps1 does this so much better ... ) The `` lock on '' makes the camera go crazy , and crazy cameras give me a headache . So because this function was useless , I was forced into clumsily seeking after enemies , who often got easy hits on me , and that experience quickly bored and annoyed me because I fighting the controls , not the monsters . I only played for a few hours before I decided there were randomized mystery dungeon games I enjoy more with similar themes . ( This is no Zelda ... heck , it 's not even as fun as Dark Legion : Vampire Apocalypse or Chocobo 's Dungeon . ) Do n't buy this one .	-1
Well Level 5 had to start somewhere . So they gave us this ... a blend of a roguelike dungeon crawler and Soul Blazer town rejuvenating . This game has its charms , and in the beginning is actually kind of fun . Crafting your own weapons and designing the town layouts are the strongest highlights . However , about midway through the charm wears off , and the formula becomes all too tedious . Basically Level 5 took what should be a 12 hour game and used time wasting methods to stretch that out to 30 hours . To see things through to the end , you 'll need a mountain of patience and a bit of a masochistic streak ( especially for the last boss ) . Supposedly Dark Cloud 2 ( AKA Dark Chronicle ) fixes all the problems this game has . So I would suggest skipping this one and going straight to its sequel instead .	-1
I give the graphics a good grade . The story an F. This game needed more dialog . I did like how it was a lot like soulblazer or actraiser , building the city . the music gets repetitive . I dont really understand why this game got good reviews . Its mediocre at best ... .	-1
Dark Cloud is a Zelda/Actraiser hybrid that seems to try too hard to be perfect on the town buidling part and neglects some things in the dungeon battles . For one , having to throw powder on your weapon to keep it from breaking is stupid . What idiot thought that idea up ? Plus the weapon building system is long and complex and not really explained well enough . They should just have better weapons lying in treasure chests as you go along .	-1
One general word of advice . Whenever you see a game that says & quot ; randomly generated dungeons & quot ; ... ... ... run . A few high profile failures have tried this , ( Anarchy Online anyone ? ) . The problem with random dungeons is just that ... ... ..the whole game seems random . There is no sense of fighting thru the underlings , to get to the & quot ; boss & quot ; . Yes there is a boss at the end of every dungeon , but there is no progression that 's immersive.The graphics are also very & quot ; cutesy & quot ; . This is a good game for children under 12 or so , would be a nice first & quot ; RPG & quot ; for someone , but for serious gamers it becomes very boring very quickly.By far the most & quot ; fun & quot ; to be had in this game is goofing around arranging the towns you have to put back together . Unfortunately , most of your time is spent in random dungeons , fighting random mobs , and it all begins to look the same VERY quickly.Rental only	-1
Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec tries to hide its craptacular and atrocious gameplay with the looks of a gorgeous racer . But then it 's like when you look at a movie star on an HDTV , and you see its appalling horrors that lie within it . To start off the controls suck greatly . For example ; when turning a corner you will notice how you ca n't seem to keep your vehicle on the road , and it constantly slips and swerves like you 're driving in snow . Another problem ; the absence of a sense of speed . When I was driving I never felt the sense of speed that should be in racers . Instead , it felt like I was maybe only going about 40mph or less . Problem # 3 ; the lack of interesting tracks to race on . When going through the various tracks I never felt compelled to look at the environments around me solely for the fact that they were so boring . Problem # 4 ; crappy career mode . Never , in my years of playing various racers did I ever go through a career mode that was so dull and made me feel so unwanting to complete it one day . Problem # 5 ; crappy multiplayer . Wow , what a horribly dull and unexciting way to challenge a friend to a race ! Here 's how it went ; we raced around the boring tracks , swerved like we were driving in snow , and we were totally bored . So , then he took the game out of his PS2 and put in Kingdom Hearts ... that is how bad the multiplayer is . The only positive thing ; the amazing graphics , that was it .	-1
I do n't really understand why this game got so much hype really . It 's nothing special . There really is n't anything great about this game .	-1
Grand Turismo is the best racing game on earth . The cars are exactly like the real thing . The reflections onto the car are very realistic as if you were driving it for real . The creators of the game made the speed , handling , acceleration and braking exactly as it would be in real life . they have millions of cars in the game like my pesonal favorite the viper GTS . like the first one the drivers test part is complicated . This time there is a line for the drivers test part that tells you what to do with the diferent coloring of the line . They have these new tracks for of road races . The tracks are somewhat complicated yet fun . So if you 're a racing game freak then you 'll love this game .	-1
The graphics are stupendous . The images are great . The detail is fantastic . But it is n't any fun to play.The reason for this is GT3 's overburdensome menu system . You spend so much time tweaking your cars and going through the tremendous amount of menus and sub menus in order to qualify or enter a race , that the whole process kills the fun of the game . GT3 is basically GT2 with superior graphics . The courses are the same ... just better looking.Qualifiying for licenses is also a big chore . While it was fun during the first two GT 's , this third one is just another step that removes you from the action of racing . The experience is frustrating.I had high hopes for GT3 , but it fell way short of being entertaining . If a racing game prevents you from racing , then what is the point ? The game is beautiful graphically . There is no doubt about this . However , the game is pure frustration because you do more menu navigating then actual racing . If racing is your interest , check out WipeOut Fusion as an alternative .	-1
I just want to say that this is a racing game if u have n't already figured that out . If u like ur games to have a little more substance then u wo n't like this . I will admit that the built-in rumble feature on the controller really adds to the realism . It is very realistic , like when you get hit or go across a bumpy dirt road , you feel every hit and feel every bump , but that 's basically the only thing it has going for it .	-1
If you like advertisements at every turn , on every vehicle , in allmost every song played and know how to for real really race a car down a buteiful looping course with cutt out cardboard fans . Then for all means purchase this game , I 'll use it for charcol to barbaque some nicely portion pieces of slaughtered cow .	-1
This game is great if you have 12 or so hrs to spend getting your Drivers lic . There are a total of 42 test you must pass to get all 6 drivers lic . Infact , I would n't be suprised if it takes someone 24 hrs to pass them all . Should n't these test be optional ? They could award cash or the best cars after finishing each lic test . But they make you go through this [ garbage ] of taking these useless test . I 'm on the last test of my B lic . I spend nearly 5 hrs total . I doubt I will pass it . Sorry , but that is not fun ! ! I love a challenge but the developers made the test way to difficult..	-1
I hated the fact that you had to pass the damn license test before you could even race . Takes away the fun from doing what 's really fun in the game ... racing . There 's a point where realism can stretch a bit too far ... I know it would be realistic to have the liscense tests in there , as you would have to take them in real life . However , they are annoying and stupid and better off not being there in a game , something meant to entertain you , not bore and frustrate you to death.Also , there are the simulation of the handling and controls ... my bro says it 's for people who know how to drive well . Well , for the rest of us , could they not have implemented arcade style handling and controls ? It would have been such an easy thing to implement , and I know it 's not realistic , but it would draw more people to play the game that would n't otherwise.Finally , there is the fact that you ca n't crash , wreck or damage your car in any way , shape or form . This is supposed to be the most realistic driving simulation , yet I can hit a wall at 200 mph and just bounce off it and all that happens is that I slow down , maybe spin out or get turned around . Supposedly this is because the car companies that liscensed their cars for use in the game did n't want to see their precious pretty cars get smashed up in a freaking game . So it was either take damage out , or the game would 've never been released in its current form . The only thing that could have given this an extra star is the occasional fun you have racing against your friends , but sadly it is n't enough .	-1
I think this game has gotten good reviews . I do n't see the appeal . It is just a castle defense game . Nothing really special about it .	-1
This game is regarded as a minor classic . It put its then-young designer on the map , and became one of the bestselling adventure titles of its era . It certainly has great production values , an epic story , plenty of conversation and plenty to do . Other reviewers do a great job heaping praise on it , so I 'll just skip to the BAD part.The three basic elements that arguably make an adventure game tick are story , characters and atmosphere . So let 's see a rundown.Story : 'The Thirteenth Floor ' and 'The Matrix ' , two films with a similar basic idea both came out about a year before the game was released , but the 'parallel universes ' premise was already considered age-old in the 80 's ( 'Labyrinth ' , 'Ultima 1-6 ' etc. ) . This game turns out to be yet another variation on the theme . Nothing groundbreaking.Characters and Dialogs : this is a biggie . In terms of classic adventure games , it apparently takes a Ron Gilbert or a Jane Jensen to dream up memorable heroes and supporting players , and this game simply does n't have what it takes . The characters and their dialogs are either lifeless or even worse . In fact , April Ryan of The Longest Journey may well be the single most irritating protagonist in a major adventure game ever . For me anyway . The author clearly made a grave mistake by turning her both 18 and a bland partygirl . Her incessant cries and whines of 'Duh ! ' or 'That is so ... uncool . ' along with her overemphasized hipster attitude were probably designed to appeal to , well , fellow hipsters I guess . Monkey Island 1-2 or Gabriel Knight did not resort to similar gimmicks and still drew in quite a fanbase . Guybrush Threepwood in particular was 19 without being annoying . Gabriel Knight was a brooding charmer . Zak McKracken was something of a lonely young bachelor . My point is that if you ca n't grow attached to the protagonist in an adventure game , your experience goes downhill quick . That 's what happened to me here . April Ryan is the kind of vapid-girl-in-tight-pants that I would n't want as a steady girlfriend -- and even less so as a heroine in an epic adventure game I intend to play through to the end . She does write a diary throughout the story but the things she writes in it read like bits of throwaway chitchat from some high school party . The diary feature adds no layer of much-needed depth to the proceedings , because April has no layer of depth . In turn , none of her friends or associates are fleshed out either : we get two run-of-the-mill best friends who have nothing substantial to say or contribute at all.Atmosphere : starts great , goes downhill once I realized the earlier points . In other words , the combined lack of a tight , original story and that of full-blooded , endearing characters result an inevitable lack of a strong atmosphere.To sum up : I wanted to like this game , as fans of elaborate and serious-minded old-school adventure games are not exactly spoiled since the late 80 's to mid 90 's boom of those great LucasArts , Sierra and Legend titles . I think The Longest Journey was a nice try , but I could n't warm up to its semi-recycled story and especially to its blas & eacute ; hipster heroine . So it 's purely up to personal taste . Your mileage may vary , especially if you regard yourself a hipster , I suppose . Deck tassel , cronkite .	-1
This & quot ; game & quot ; hardly felt like a game . It 's more like a walkthrough movie . Check that . It 's more like a mediocre walkthrough novel , replete with unentrhalling dialogue and silly , ridiculous puzzles.The storyline is inventive and interesting , and it could have been a masterpiece , but the script writing and voice acting are so dreadful that it is very difficult to even care what 's going to happen at the end . When I say that the voice acting is bad , I do n't mean it 's the ordinary & quot ; bad & quot ; for a computer game , I mean that it 's pitiful , even for a computer game . The main character speaks all of her lines like a six year old child from Sesame Street . This looks extra absurd with all of the profanity in the game ( who wrote this script -- Eddie Murphy ? ) . I ca n't believe how much profanity there was in this game . It does n't fit in at all . Imagine the Teletubbies saying the & quot ; f & quot ; word to each other constantly , and you will have a feel for what the dialog of this game is like.More than half of the puzzles have no logic whatsoever to them . This is perhaps the biggest shortcoming of the game . Some of the solutions are terribly obvious , and others make no sense whatsoever . This game suffers pretty badly from the & quot ; you ca n't solve puzzle A until you have talked to person B about problem C & quot ; disease that strikes bad puzzle games . It also has a lot of puzzles where you only have to keep clicking on the 8 items in your inventory until you guess the right one . Good puzzles are the key to a good puzzle game . This one has very few.As far as graphics and sound go ? Sound is very good , and so is the music . The graphics and animation are VERY mediocre , and I think that I am being complementary . I ca n't believe all of the reviews that are saying what great graphics this game has . Give me a break ! ! On almost every screen , you are a small figure in a big environment , with only about two or three little things to look at or interact with . It might have been good three or four years ago , but it is subpar compared to the superb environments created in games nowadays like Thief and Deus Ex. & quot ; The Longest Journey & quot ; should have been a novel . It was a disappointment as a game .	-1
This is not a game . It is a soap opera with dialogue taking up all of the game play time . Granted , it is very well done , but I am at chapter 6 wondering if I have the patience to continue with the overly repetitve nature of the & quot ; talking THREADS & quot ; needed to proceed to the next 'scene ' . This is really a movie , with the pretense of being an interactive game . Granted , it is a well done computer mouse click movie , but why pretend it is a game ? To be fair , I am male , so nonstop chatting about everyting I see is not something that entertains me . I guess this is a 'chick flick ' sort of ? game ? .If you love to hear people blather on and on and on and on and on and on and on ad nauseum with nothing happening in between , this is for you.I feel like giving this one star due to the absolutely ridiculous amount of dialogue one must plod through ( fully 99 % of the 'pretend game ' play ) but I will be generous and give it 1 extra star for at least being creative . But I still insist this is NOT really a game , but a movie .	-1
I bought this game because the reviews I read were glowing and it looked like it had good graphics.When I got home and loaded it ( it took forever to install ) I discovered that the game was 95 % just walking around and talking to various characters . Some of the characters are homo-sexual and the language was terrible . I do n't want to listen to profanity or some gay woman telling me about her sexual life . I just wanted to play an adventure game . I did n't want to hear all the gay talk . After about a half an hour I had had enough of this game.This game was totally boring with reguards to gameplay.The content was vial.The profanity was plentiful and totally uncalled for.I give this game my lowest rating .	-1
This is the dumbest mega man title yet . I was floored when i saw the game and first played it , but when i saw that there were no bosses and no charge shot , i felt betrayed . i did finish the game as i did not want to lose the money , just a big let down .	-1
Nintendo in my words have gone downhill since the mid to late 90 's and now they 're mostly gone from the gaming industry . I have to admit though in the 80 's they were HUGE ! The Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) you can never diss . I liked the NES so much and even when the Super NES came out I still played with my old buddy . I do like Sega , Sony , and Microsoft but now I really have to interest with Nintendo . The Nintendo 64 was an okay system . It used cartridges and I wish Nintendo would have realized that now you can have disks ! PSOne was a 32-bit system while the Nintendo 64 was a 64-bit system . I really do not see the big difference with the graphics and I like PSOne 's graphics better than the Nintendo . Nintendo 64 has all the classic games as seen in the 80 's . Arcade games and Mario games are so old and I think Nintendo should go more to adults now . For children the Nintendo 64 and the GameCube are very good systems because there is no violent games or anything . When you get to be a teenager you start wanting violent games ( Grand Theft Auto ) . All around the Nintendo 64 with the wierd controller has n't satisified me but if you like it that 's your opinion .	-1
This game is so great it does n't have 2 player ... . That 's how awesome it is . I hate Mario games . Mario 2 to me at least is the best one . Where peach can hover an luigi jumps all high .	-1
They get in the way of the screen , and they show very little light.I recommend getting a Micro , SP , a GameBoy Light ( does n't work for GBA games ) , a DS ( only GBA games ) , or just playing in light .	-1
The Wormlight sounds good , does n't it ? & quot ; You can play your Game Boy Color in the Dark ! Is n't that cool ! & quot ; Yes , my friends , it is cool . That is , if it did n't use your GBA 's batteries . No big deal , you say ? What would your impression be if a drunk came up to your door and freeloaded off you for the rest of your life ? There . Now that we share the same point of view , DO NOT BUY THIS LIGHT . IT WILL DESTROY YOUR BATTERIES ' LIFE , AND TRUST ME YOU DO N'T WANT THAT .	-1
Save yourself the trouble of having to return it . The worm light puts out very little light , and you have to try to position it so the light does n't just reflect off the screen . The price is right , but these lights wear out very quickly . You would be much better off buying a light magnifier for your system .	-1
This light stinks . you barely get anything out of it and it wastes your batteries .	-1
This is a lousy product , period ! I purchased one of these cheaper memory cards and it worked for a month . I had the pleasure of the memory card breaking when I was over halfway through Oni on the PS2 ( you will have to have played ONI to know how upset I was because Oni is a really frustrating game ) . Needless to say , I went out to purchase a memory card made by Sony after I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Sony Technical Support . Oh by the way , Sony said to me that the 3rd party DVD remotes are not endorsed by Sony and they could potentially cause problems with the PS2 console , so I ditched the 3rd party remote I had too.Save yourself the time and money and just pay the few extra dollars for a memory card that is endorsed and manufactured by Sony . That way you wo n't have to spend hour after hour of sleepless nights just to get back to where you were in the game you were playing because you had one of these cheap memory cards and it crapped out on you right at the middle of the game .	-1
i bought this memory card yesterday . i took it home and popped it in.it did not work it was broken . took it back and got another one and it was broken.so i got the sony one and it works fine . i mean dont get me wrong the shipment could have been knocked around but 2 out of 2 broken ? ? ? ? my friend has one and a sony one . it seems that the sony one loads twice as fast as this one and its easier to get out of the playstation . this one is a little tight in the console . so just because its 5 dollars less dont think it is just as good . if you ask me i would spend the extra five bucks and get a memory card that will work when you need it to.thanx alot and happy gameing outhere .	-1
I bought this memory card and was sorely dissappointed . The salesperson told me that the Sony brand ones ( which were out of stock ) were better , and I dismissed it as a Pro-Sony sales pitch . I shoulda listened . This card & quot ; lost & quot ; three weeks worth of saved games and data . The company offered to replace it for free & gt ; if they find it to be defective & lt ; . Since it appears that the card only reformatted itself I ca n't see them replacing it , because & quot ; technically & quot ; it works . Too bad they ca n't recover all the hours of lost gameplay.I 'm sticking with Sony cards from now on ... . I 've been burned by third party cards one time too many .	-1
The online adaptor works great with any online game that came out before 2004 . DSL is not compatible with this adaptor on ALL games created after 2004 . Do not fall for these other reviews . I have DSL and I was able to play Madden 2004 online , but Madden 2005 IS NOT COMPATIBLE , I called EA Sports and a recording tells you DSL is not compatible with ANY EA games sold after 2004 . I tried calling my ISP as well as Sony but found absolutely no tech support on this subject . How can you have 10 million users who have DSL and possibly make games that are not compatible with DSL I ask you ? Sony found a way . Oh and do n't think you 'll be able to play SOCOM II online with DSL either , I repeat all newer games will not work with DSL . Do n't get me wrong , I love the PS2 , but man did they drop the ball with the online adaptor ! ! !	-1
This should basically be for a collector only because the Network is gone . I ca n't do anything with this product online at all . Sony is kind of bogus for shutting down the servers for the PS2 network because it would be fun to still be able to go on line and play with other gamers . Some one else should get something going again so this item is useable .	-1
The most important question concerning this product is , does it work ? The answer is yes and no.When I first got it and connected it to my cable modem , the setup disk work perfectly and I was on in minutes . Sweet ! Then I tried to set it with my router . I used the Linksys BEFSR41 router , probably the most ubiquitous router in the home market . Due to it 's monopoly , I was also using the largest broadband provider - Comcast ( Oh I how I hate them ) . So , in terms of home networking , it 's the most standard setup around . Anyway , I setup the router to work , and tested it with my Windows 98 machine . That 's right , the router and cable modem worked with 6 year old technology . Yet the setup disk for this brand new network adapter did not recognize the connection . It 's a simple DHCP connection that really should not pose any problems , but it does.I searched the web for a little while , but I could not find the right settings . The Sony website is absolutely useless . To get my PS2 online , I 'm now forced to move my cable modem to my living room , and I can not have my computer and PS2 connected at the same time . Sony should have tested it better .	-1
This product for the PS2 that enables you to play online is an absolute rip . I have pleanty of reasons but let me give you the jist of it . Now see first of the price of the adapter alone is pleanty enough to put someone down . Hell I love online gaming but 40 some bucks taken out of my pocket to do it is a little too much . The adapter is fine within itself . The problem I have with it , is just the online capabilities . Now first off installing and connecting the adapter to your PS2 ( ... ) takes way to much time . Another thing is the booklet which they give you and expect you to read it is like a chapter book not a manuel . In order to start playing you must put the disc in which is given within the package and sit through a long tidius process . It is not as simple as to plug it in and play instead they had to create a long difficult process.Another problem with this product is the capabilities with the games . First of the games are very limited ... From that I mean the choice in which one has to play from . Eventually I know more games will come out ... But eventually PS3 will come out wo n't it ? Nevertheless for the games that are compatiable with this adapter the connectivity servers suck ass ! ! Playing from several of my friends house and my own the lagging and time it takes to enter a game is extensive and overstrenuius . There are pleanty more things wrong with this including hidden fees with cables ( not included in package ) the games and routers ( Which I needed ) . I spent in total around $ 200 in high hopes of playing online . Instead I had the enjoyment of staring into the menu screen of the PS2 . If your smart you 'll spend your money on something else you want instead of this POS . By any means necessary stay away from this product ! !	-1
This game is the absolute worst Pirate game ever . It completely lacks the fun factor of Sid Meiers Pirates ! , or the polish of any many of the top quality games . This is headed for the bargin bin soon.It has typical Bethesda Softworks graphics bugs and other game crashing bugs . Ship control is horrid . Game play is non-existent . The interface is a cludge . The sound is good and the graphics are & quot ; ok & quot ; . Brilliant in spots , and simply ugly in others . There are quite a few graphics bugs . Even with patch 1.06 ( released 04/2001 ) . No matter how well you pound an enemy ship , they will never strike . You must board ( almost impossible ) . And then defeat the enemy captain in a duel . This duel is limited to a couple of crude keyboard strokes . And in the first 12+ I tried , I lost all 12+ . Oh what fun . So I had the joy of reloading the start postion a dozen times and experimenting with several different There is absolutely no game balance . There is no way to scale down the difficulty level . In about 75 % of the opening games , I was attacked by 3 spanish ships ( you always start with the Spanish as your enemy ) . No matter how much of their sails you shoot out with chain shot , they remain always faster and more maneuverable then you . Your ship has 3 cannons facing rearward for when you flee . I used those liberally for hours ( real time ) and was in the end caught and killed . ( repeatedly ) . This is a Simply STUPID way to begin the game . If you simply must own all sailing or pirate games get it . I tried to give it to a buddy I went to college with , and after trying it he gave back . Even free , it was over priced .	-1
I bought this game based on the enthusiastic reviews below , and now I have to wonder what these people were thinking . & quot ; Sea Dogs & quot ; is indeed 3 games in one . However , none of them is particularly complelling . They consist of:1 . A roleplaying game , which consists of walking around and asking people things . However you generally ask each person one thing , and they give you one response , so there 's not much room for thinking.2 . A naval simulator , which is mildly interesting for the first couple of fights . However , since every fight is basically the same , this quickly becomes boring -- endlessly sailing in circles and lining up broadsides against your opponents.3 . A video game style fencing sequence that is simply annoying . It 's ridiculously primitive compared to the martial arts style games on the market , and one has to wonder why it 's even in here.Over all , there was nothing particularly compelling about the game play . The graphics are pretty , but how long can you stare at the waves and the storm clouds when the game itself is dry as toast ? Also , the game is SERIOUSLY buggy , even with the new 1.4 patch installed and running . The game is completely incompatible with a number of video cards . So if you do buy the game , there 's a modest chance that it simply wo n't run on your machine .	-1
This game is not my particular interest . More involved than i would like to have it . And easier less thought provking game is what I was looking for .	-1
I just wanted a fun game , did n't have to be high tech , yet I was VERY let down with the game.I first of all went to the OPTIONS section to select beginner , as was advised by a supposed experienced player on Amazon , well there was NO OPTION to select beginner , or any other skill level.All the hype and info sites , these persons must have worked for Bethesda , the game maker , because the game does not perform as advertised.The cheat codes do not work , unless you need a patch , and the start ship , a Pink , just gets sunk by 3 Spanish Galleons or Pirates from the start , so you do not have a chance to build up money to upgrade your ship or frankly to continue playing at all ... your just dead in the water.There are no Treasure Galleons to capture , and only one pirate map at the end of a quest ... .Several efforts at making the game work for any length of time failed for the same game flaw of being attacked , ( overpowering attacks by Spaniards or Pirates ) All in all its very lame ... ... ... Maybe the game would be better labeled ... An Example Of The Worst Game A Company Can Make ! ! ! ! ! ! It wins First Place for the WORST PIRATE / TRADER game since computer games were developed..Thanks Bethesda ! I could only give one STAR to reflect my opinion , but I would have given it a NEG . 10 STAR if possible.So life goes on , look for another Pirate/Trader game in the future .	-1
Why spend [ money ] on something that does NOTHING for you except possibly make your PS2 look better . The PS2 is in no danger of falling over when it in horizontal , so whats the point of putting it verticle , now you controller ports detract from the look even more than having it horizontal . Spend this [ money ] towards a new game .	-1
First of all , why the HELL is this thing $ 15 dollars PLUS tax . I have PlayStation2 , and I do n't generally like it . I thought Microsoft was trying to steal your money , but now this PIECE OF GARBAGE comes along and it is a JOKE . Why is Amazon selling this for $ 15 dollars . i got mine with my PlayStation2 and now they are selling it just to keep space . This is a total joke ... ... ... ..Now that I have cooled down , this can be space saving . If it was free , well , it would be a good buy . PlayStation2 is not THAT big , and if you do n't have enough space 1 ) Your poor and can only put everything in one room or 2 ) You have those TV 's which have a million plugs . That is why it gets at least two stars , because nothing is THAT bad , ( well ... some games and equipment have gone over the edge ) .So , instead of wasting $ 15 dollars , go out and save up for some games . The blue color is not impressive , and it does n't cool down and it does n't scratch your discs . Actually , it only does one thing , wastes your money .	-1
I was going to buy this way back when but I decided to rent it first . Beat the game in less than an hour . Not worth the cash . At least the Xbox version has online play .	-1
As a huge fan of parts # 1 & amp ; 2 , I had high expectations . Granted , game play is with much the same physics model & amp ; powerups . There are plenty of new cars available , with a smattering of the good , old cars , too . Curiously absent is ` Die Anna ' and her car . You MUST play as the character Max Damage.But the sticking point for me is the peds in part # 3 , they 're hostile . No bikini girls & amp ; grandmas here . More like crazed green mutants wielding lengths of pipe who 'll attack en masse and pound you on the fender until you 're toast ... just try stopping your vehicle in the midst of a group of crazed lead-pipe hooligans , you 'll see ! TDR was coded in Australia , and there 's an & quot ; ozzie & quot ; level where you can run down 'roos in & quot ; Mad & quot ; Max Rakatanski 's MVP interceptor or Humongous 's custom ride from Road Warrior . There 's a Thunderdome of sorts , and a Bartertown , as well . Z.Z.Top seem to be driving one monster truck . These little touches are nice , but the lack of innocent peds screaming & amp ; pleading in terror , as in parts # 1 & amp ; 2 , is too great to overcome . The peds in TDR hurl epithets about your mama 's sexual history along with their molotovs . Bring back the grannies with walkers !	-1
As a longtime fan of the Carmageddon series , I have been and remain quite disappointed with this third incarnation , no matter how hard I try to like it . Carmageddon has always been about running amuck on city streets , in construction zones , and through mountain communities , running over cows and men and grannies with stretchers , and pulverizing your opponents . Carmageddon is all about racing , `` challenging '' missions , and frustration . If you try to play the game as it is apparently designed to be played , you can not possibly have any fun . You start out with a limited time and have to struggle to add any bonus time before your experience is aborted way too early . The map feature , which was quite good in Carmageddon 2 , is cartoonish and aggravating . The powerups and surprise bonuses along the way are n't very impressive or extensive ( although the designers unfortunately felt compelled to leave the silly Bouncy Bouncy feature in the game ) . The racing environments are nowhere near as extensive as I was used to , which is a further criticism I have of this game . The only new touch I really liked is the tendency of pedestrians to jump around on one leg after you put the other one out of commission ; overall , though , running over pedestrians here is just not as much fun as it should be.The fatal flaw here is the emphasis on objective missions . It takes so long to figure out the challenge race and somehow miraculously complete it that your disgust with the whole business overweighs any excitement you may have about finally getting a chance to race on a new track . It is hard enough to figure out what you are supposed to do , let alone do it in the minimal time allotted . Once you think you have it , another extra requirement pops up to dash your hopes ; if you could save a race or challenge during the action , it would do much to help alleviate the problem . This game really betrays the wonderfully fun Carmageddon tradition and makes this a game quite unable to offer enough positives to outweigh the many negatives . The result is the death of a great gaming series .	-1
Carma II was GREAT ! I loved it ! A great way to take out my aggressiveness at the end of a hard day ! And nobody gets hurt ! Carma 3 SUCKED ! I 'm not even going to be kind on this one . I was VERY disappointed with the entire game and trashed it within a half hour after installing it .	-1
A friend of mine has this game . i found it really annoying and frustrating . It 's to difficult to play . i could n't even get past the first level . i recommend borrowing it from someone who owns it or rent it somehow instead of buying it .	-1
I was unable to get past the frustrating `` Parappa '' style first level so I ca n't recommend this game . After 20 minutes of not getting anywhere , I gave up and threw it away . ( And I was able to beat `` Parappa '' so I know I 'm not totally inept at this sort of game . ) There 's no difficulty option , nor is there a way to skip levels . Do n't waste your time .	-1
I have n't purchased this yet but this review can still be EXTREMELY helpful.I was Playing my PS2 on my 56 tv and I said to myself..wow . that quality ... . I went on to amazon because I had heard about these new cables that improved quality . I found one ( this one ) and it looked great ! I hurried back to my Sony receiver ( It connects up my DVD player , TV and surround sound system ) and looked at the back . No S-Video . I got a flash light and searched it over again , hoping I missed it . No signs . I moved my tv over so I could look at the back . WHAT ! There I see them , 2 s-video imputs . That makes me mad . How could monster assume that everybody is going to be playing this on their TV ? Dont they realize that some people use home theater receivers ! ? NOOO ! Theres no way I 'm giving up my great surround sound for this . If you want to buy this , I would check your receiver first . If you dont have component cables , ( which I DONT ! ! THEY ALSO ARE ONLY ON THE TV ) or S-video on your receiver , I would suggest getting a 200 regular AV cable from Monster . That one still improves quality quite a bit .	-1
Honestly the cables that come with the system are fine . I wasted money on this one .	-1
I bought this cable to hook up my Playstation 2 with a Promedia DD-5.1 ( Digital Decoder ) . The Problem is that the cable I bought did n't produce 5.1 Dolby Digital or DTS , just stereo . Read the reviews for the X-box Lightwave 100 cable ; they are the same cable except for the color . Some people maybe have n't figured it out yet because they do n't use a Digital Decoder , but all they are hearing is Stereo sound . Im pretty upset because I sent my Digital Decoder back to Klipsch thinking that was the problem , but it was actually the cable . By the way the customer service at Klipsch is simply the best , they produced high quality equipment , not like over at monster cable . So beware ! If you are paying big $ for a cable should n't it at least work or do what it say it does ?	-1
Maybe Im just a rock but how are you supposed to connect your system to both a TV and a audio reciever/decoder ? There is not enough play in the end to allow the video cable to go to the TV and the audio cables to go to my sound system . So after trying to slice the individual cables apart with my kbar I finally gave up and just used regular AV cables .	-1
The cable does offer superior picture and sound quality as the product claims . There is a flaw with the cable however . For almost [ money ] you would expect a better connector from the cable to the PS2 system . The monster cable connector is not quite a tight enough fit which causes it to make a bad contact . The symptoms you might get are flickering on the screen and slight loss in sound or sound quality before the connection is lost without warning while playing . Not only is this annoying but it is also frustrating when you hit a tense spot in a game and then have to pause it to correct the problem . I would have expected a lot more for my money ! I should mention that my PS2 is ALWAYS stationary and is not moving at all when the connection is lost . This situation while aggrivating , is not all that bad but I would recommend a different cable for anyone who has all of their A/V equipment jammed in a cabinet and can not get to the connectors easily .	-1
Who said this was scary ? Must 've been a real whoosie ... The game is awkward in it 's controls and it 's annoying trying to recharge . The graphics are good , but scary ? C'mon ... If you think this is scary you must 've led a sheltered life ... I love exciting games and this one bored me ... I would n't reccommend it to anyone who has a short attention span ...	-1
A friend gave me this pad before considering throwing it in the trash . After two days of having it , > I & lt ; threw it in the trash . The D-pad has got to be the worst thing about it , its a D-pad that wants to be an analog stick . So its never fast enough on oldskool games because of all its `` give . '' It has the right ammount of buttons ( Start , Select , L & R ) but that D-pad is soooo hoakie . I 'd rather have an old Turbo Touch 360 's flat touch panel from my Nintendo days . Atleast those actually worked . If you want console quality but on your PC , do n't bother with flimsy copycat PC gamepads because they ALL suck . Get a Lik-Sang adapter and you can use PS1 & 2 pads on your PC ! Download Joy2Key and you 'll have awesome Keyboard and Mouse mapping software just like any Saitek or Logitech pad .	-1
Although it has 10 workable buttons which come in handy for some games , it has some major flaws . On some games , if you press Up on the gamepad you go Down , and when you press Down you 'll go up . The directional pad is totally useless , games where you need to move the D-pad rapidly , forget about it ! ! The buttons in the back eventually get stuck . You ca n't use any other Gravis controller while this one is in use . And on top of all that , not even the uninstaller works right . When you goto uninstall the controller , it screws up your computers registry files . It was a nightmare just to get my computer working again . I 'll never buy another Gravis gamepad again .	-1
This is a great game but these Amazon sellers are charging over price for this game . The extra levels you can get on Xbox live Marketplace if you have the regular edition . Do n't pay unreasonable prices.So buy the regular version . Then download the extra levels on xbox live . Have fun and do n't let these sellers take advantage of you . They should n't be overcharging in this economy ; )	-1
And I give them one star for trying.The game really does LOOK good . And it seems like it would be a great game . But it is , at this point , almost completely unplayable.If you buy this game before they fix it ( which could be months from now ) , here 's what to expect : lag ( VERY often ) that can last longer than a minute , crashing to the desktop at least once an hour , computer lockups at least once every few hours , occasional inability to log in at all , items which do not work , missions which do not work , character death due to lag , and countless other minor and major bugs.I was actually very patient with these problems until the publisher lied to its customers . First , they told everyone the & quot ; free month & quot ; ( your purchase price includes one month of online play ) would not begin until the game was playable . Then , six days later , with almost no changes to the game , they declared it playable and began the billing cycle.To make matters worse , I ca n't even cancel my account . I 'll probably have to dispute the charge with my bank . But at least I 've already returned the game.Maybe I 'll try again in a few months , but I do n't really have a whole lot of faith or trust in Funcom right now .	-1
Take a look at the date of my review , because as of this date , many magazines and websites have claimed that Anarchy Online has fixed most of its problems . HOWEVER , I just joined the game , and am unable to play for longer than 5 minutes without getting kicked off . Yet I still play . And I still get kicked off . Over and over.It is a shame that a game this much fun is so difficult to play . I will tell you that I witnessed many other players who did n't seem to have any difficulties at all playing , so maybe you might not either ... But it is still a gamble ... Bugs aside , this game is brilliant . Brilliant in a thousand little ways that only a massive online RPG can be . I know because I 've played the other games before , and I can see how AO has reduced the repedativeness and boredom of some of these other games . Custom missions give players their own private dungeons , so they can play without competition for loot . Apartment buildings give every player their own space , right off the bat . Various transportation networks give different professions different abilities to travel , and 3 major factions have split the world apart such that one character will never be able to see everything . Add to this little things like built in scripts , macros , reduced healing time , blah blah blah , if you do n't know what I 'm talking about , just take my word for it , AO is the best online -game- there is , if it only were n't hampered by its bugs . Veteran players , most of the requests I 've seen for other MMORPGs are in AO , in some form or another . Check it out , but at your own risk .	-1
I will never EVER buy a product from funcom EVER again.This is the WORST developed game I have ever played . It devlievered on nothing it promised . It had horrible crashes for at least 2 months and now they reintroduced even more problems.Worst of all they have NO customer service . Something goes wrong with your game ? Tough ! Wait for a patch . No quick fixes and completely moderated forums so you ca n't even voice your complaints anymore ! I canceled my account and I urge you to never EVER buy this game . That also includes any funcom game including their upcoming MMORPG .	-1
Anarchy Online invaded my life for several months , unfortunately . It was my first MMORPG so this game took me by storm at first , and exploring the beautiful world of Rubi-Ka was a long venture in and of itself.The skill system is great , combat is genuinely suspenseful and fun for the most part , and the people in-game were helpful and mature most of the time.But ultimately AO became nothing more than some idle chat with others and running on the leveling treadmill . I would go to a mission booth , run to mission cave , finish it , go to shop , wash , rinse and repeat . It can take a couple of hours early on to level up , and as it goes on it can take several hours at a time . I felt like I was getting nowhere and the missions were incredibly repetitive and dull . All of them looked the same and behaved the same , and you always fought the same handful of creatures or people.To add to the frustration Funcom constantly tinkered with the game 's balance , almost literally ruining the game with one patch , it created so many new bugs and problems people jumped ship big time.I joined a guild which was nothing more than a private shopping chat channel and team matchmaker . PVP action is filled with no-lifers who & quot ; tweak & quot ; their characters with the help of higher level players and & quot ; implants , & quot ; and Funcom has let this go on since the beginning.The game is repetitive , frustrating , buggy still , and has the worst lag of any online game I 've ever played , that alone was enough to make me quit . I wanted to like the game and make it a long-term habit , but the game would n't let me.And judging from the new & quot ; ideas & quot ; being considered for the game this summer , I do n't see any hope for this game at all .	-1
While Anarchy Online is an exciting new concept in online gaming that could replace the standard swords and sorcerors in the current & quot ; Big 3 & quot ; online games ( Asheron 's Call , Ultima Online , Everquest ) , this game IS NOT READY to go online.Anarchy Online is another online game that was rumored to have been released before it was ready to help the cash-stretched company obtain quick income . I played the Beta version up until the week before the game 's release and while I was impressed with the sci-fi theme ( and new online concepts such as everyone owning a house for their possessions ) even with the smaller number of users in the Beta stage , the server ( s ) could not take the strains of running the game.In other words , if you purchase this game right now , you can expect huge lags ( This is the game pausing because the internet connections are n't working properly . ) , resolution problems and other frustrating dilemmas . These difficulties are even more frustrating when you consider that you 're paying a monthly fee . During the game 's initial release , the company did not start charging accounts because of the problems but as I write this review , the company has decided to start charging accounts which has many current owners of the game angry as they have yet to experience a & quot ; working & quot ; game.It looks like a great concept for an online game , but the best bet would be to wait awhile and explore internet sources to find out the current state of the game .	-1
What is interesting about Anarchy Online is how much potential this game had . Great Graphics , a solid story line , and promises that players would be able to alter the course of the game 's storyline all added up to an incredible dream for many gamers . The problem is , the game failed to deliver in most areas BESIDES graphics , leaving us with just another & quot ; interesting for a week & quot ; piece of software that will be popular only until the & quot ; Next Big MMORPG & quot ; comes around . If you like running out in a big field , clicking on a monster , killing it , clicking on another monster , killing it , clicking on another monster , etc , etc , etc ... then this game is for you . If you 're looking for an engrossing RPG , look somewhere else.One more important note : This game DOES contain & quot ; easter egg & quot ; nudity - that is , in certain extremely rare situations , you are able to see the genitals of some of the & quot ; avatars & quot ; in the game .	-1
I honestly wanted to give Anarchy Online a chance . The massively multiplayer genre needs some new blood , and there were some interesting things in this game when it first went live : good graphics , promising character classes , and a sci-fi setting ( though really not very 'hard ' sci-fi , more like fantasy with some 'futuristic ' touches ) .However , the developer , Funcom , has demonstrated truly astonishing incompetence and bad faith since the launch of the game . All games of this kind have rocky launches , but do n't be fooled : the problems of Anarchy Online go far deeper than a rocky launch . Each patch has actually introduced serious new balance problems and several , including the most recent patch , have reintroduced old bugs and added some new ones . These are not just garden-variety bugs , but game-stopping ones , mind you.Now Funcom has taken the extraordinary step of shutting down the support bulletin boards at its own site , which is always a sign of imminent disaster in the gaming world . It 's the equivalent of a toxically bad film that a movie studio tries to keep away from critics hoping that they can just get one weekend of good box office before the word gets out.AO 's European launch is imminent . If our good friends in Europe have any sense , they 'll give this game a wide berth , whatever its price . The sooner Funcom closes the lights on the few remaining players in this flaming wreck of a game , the better . Perhaps they can sell the remnants of their tattered code to a real developer and someday we 'll see the game reach its potential . It 's a certainty that Funcom itself ca n't pull it off .	-1
Review - Anarchy OnlineI am currently a member of the Beta community for Anarchy Online . For weeks now many of the community members have spent hours upon hours trying to solve countless unaddressed problems that FunCom are ignoring . To sum it up . Anarchy Online is an advanced and very graphical RPG , if you can get it to work . I personally believe that no self respecting programmer out there that would launch a game in a state like this . If you want to buy it , wait a few months .	-1
I was in the beta ... well ... I never actually played in the beta because I could never get the game to work . Then I was dumb enough to buy the game ... lol . After about a week of hair pulling , countless crashes to desktop , a few re installs , I actually got into the game and played..for about 10 minutes at a time or until I zoned and crashed to desktop . But these problems are covered in other reviews , let 's get to the real problems.1 . BORING : Once you get past all the bugs , ( if you can ) , you find out what the game is really all about . Well ... not much . One of the main selling points for this game , is that camping would be eliminated by the & quot ; random missions generators & quot ; . The key word here is RANDOM . Everything about this game is random and generic , and that 's it 's biggest downfall . There is no sense of purpose , no sense of direction , and no sense of accomplishment.The missions all start to look the same after about the 10th one , and you 'll be on hundreds of them if you ever want any cash . This also ties in to the lack of boss mobs , and lack of dungeons.You fight mostly outdoors , or in the & quot ; missions & quot ; . Which are randomly generated & quot ; dungeons & quot ; . The implementation of which is absolutely horrible . Mobs are spawned with no ryhme or reason , some dungeons have ZERO mobs in them , some have 5 that will all rush you at zone it.2 . SERIOUS coding and engine problems : Not even going to go into all of these as they alone would take up the 1000 word limit on reviews , needless to say it 's overwhelming.3 . Crashing , crashing , and more crashing : Self explainatory.4 . Character creation : Suppose to eliminate cookie cutter characters , but it does n't . Sure , you can train anything you want , but because of the skill system , and the way the points you get to spend must be distributed to make your character viable , you end up with really only one path you can take per given proffesion.5 . Monster AI : The single WORST programming of AI I have ever seen in any video game ... and that 's saying a lot.6 . Exploits , cheats , hacks : By the time I left , which was under one month into release , there were already players that were level 150+ . Being that this is a PvP game , that 's not good . Exploits were RAMPANT and numerous . Exploiters went scott free.7 . Balance of proffesions : Non existant . The game is so unbalanced it 's not even funny . There are 2 viable classes to play if you want to live PvP , forget it if you play any of the others.Just a note about me . I 'm an avid gamer , and have 3 characters over 50 in EQ , and 4 over 50 in AC . So I obviously have the patience for online gaming ... lol.This game fails in every single aspect of gameplay . It 's boring , repetitive , buggy , unbalanced , and just plain no fun . Avoid at all costs , you have been warned .	-1
In theory , combining Capcom 's and SNK 's characters into one fighting game would be an awesome idea . Both companies are held in high regard when it comes to the fighting genre , but Capcom Vs. SNK suffers from too many gameplay and animation problems . First off , the gameplay favors SNK heavily . Capcom 's characters are watered down to only 4 attack buttons because of this , and that alone is enough to disappoint me . The SNK characters remain intact for the most part though , save for a few missing special moves . Plus , the whole & quot ; ratio & quot ; thing ( being able to choose how many characters you can play as based on their rank ) is just a confusing mess . The animation is also cut tremendously , and the whole game is set at a low resolution so that each character looks pixelated . I believe the bottom line is that if you are a devoted Capcom fan , you will most likely be let down by Capcom Vs. SNK . If you like the SNK games however , such as King Of Fighters and Fatal Fury , you may want to check this game out .	-1
broke after about of month of use and wont but another because of that.just becaise of the poor build quality	-1
This is a review of this product : Super Bust-A-Move ( PlayStation 2 video game ) . Amazon may display this review on the page of another version of this product , for which this review may not apply . After reading this review , please click on the link so that you can be assured that the product this review applies to is the same one you thought it was for . ( This is a review that I originally wrote on 07/04/2003 ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I ca n't believe all the good reviews this game is getting . I just have to chime in with my opinion on this game . Simply put , they broke Bust-A-Move . They removed almost all of the game play modes ; they removed the edit mode ; they made the controls unresponsive ( they take a second to respond ) ; they added annoying and distracting backgrounds ; the bubbles have been graphically-enhanced so they they , too , are now annoying to look at ; they took away all the cool characters and added a bunch of Pokemon rejects ; and they added a TON of long loading screens.Most of that is pretty much self-explanatory , so I do n't need to elaborate on it . However , I will give you a list of what few game play modes there are in the game : - 1 Player : Training / Normal / Classic- CPU Battle : Normal / Expert- 2 Player Battle : Normal / Expert / Chain ReactionYup , that 's it.I rented this game to see if I had made a mistake buying Bust-A-Move 4 ( for the Playstation 1 ) . Well , I can tell you this , my purchase of Bust-A-Move 4 was definitely well worth it . I haveSuper Bust-A-Move 2on my rental list . Although I suspect that it wo n't be much better than this one , I 'll still be optimistic and give it a try.If you want a good Bust-A-Move game to play on your Playstation 2 , get yourselfBust-A-Move '99orBust-A-Move 4 ( both for the Playstation 1 ) . Both are essentially the same , though 4 adds pulleys to the puzzles . Sure the graphics look like they came off of a SNES , but is that really such a bad thing ? ! ? The load times are short ( to non-existent at times ) , the characters look cool ( in that odd-Japanese way ) , and most of all , the controls are extremely responsive and there are a ton of game play modes .	-1
Do n't buy a ps2 just becuse it 's style How can you know it 's the best if you are one way minded what about dreamcast gamecub xbox Is dreamcast dead hard to say when sonic aventrue 2 come out sega ca n't make enough of it it 's so good	-1
I 've tried many times to play this game , and did n't get to even play it the first few times as it would just say that it 's saving and would stay that way for an hour or more.Then I kept trying , and finally made it past certain points , but then the game screwed up again.So , I gave up on it.I am hoping that the seller was n't being a snake and knew this game has a memory card glitch and still sold it.I wrote a review for this game a few days ago and I guess amazon would n't let me post for some reason.I was just trying to warn people of this game problem and possibly the seller I had ordered from.I did n't get very far in the game.Only a couple of missions before I have up ! MAKE SURE THE ONE YOU 'RE RECEIVING WORKS ! Watch out for some sellers on here ! I would return it , but I 'd rather not waste MORE money.It 's too bad I was really looking forward to playing this and this game had a different twist to the series which I liked ... .Oh well !	-1
After reading a lot of the reviews here , it convinced me that this next version of Rouge Sqaudren was just as good , or even , better then Rougue.Well , I 've played Rougue Squadren many , many times , again and again over the years.. and I just recently bought this game expecting a game thats just as good , but I have been let down dramaticly.First off . You need to know passwords to access things to help you to get through a lot of the levels , it 's too hard without them . The game play is sluggish at times , but a lot of the feel of R.S is lost in this version . There is no veiw from inside the cockpit in this one either.Secondly , there is hardly any ships you can use . Even when you unlock all the crafts , there is only the Naboo fighter ( which is in Rouge Squadren if you use the code to unlock it ) and it 's just the same as an X-wing . There is a Naboo Bomber . Which is just like the bombers in R.S only it 's a four engine Naboo plane , very slow , hard to monover and almost useless at times . There is a Naboo Police fighter or something that is just a Blue Naboo fighter with less capabilities , you can also unlock the Sith fighter , which is probably the best one to use on mission thats you can use it in . On other levels there is ones where you use Speeders , there 's 3 speeder roughly the same with diffrent speeds and guns but all handle about the same , plus you can unlock an ATT tank which is fun , but not helpfull in some areas . And there is a boat sort of thing you use on a couple of water levels . This game lacks fun with the ships because most of them are the same with different speeds.. at least R.S you knew which ship was best for what and could use them on most missions , this one has a few levels where you can use ships , but without codes you can only use 1 per level , and when you get the medals you can have about 3 to choose a level , or 4 if you have codes.Gaining medals in this one blows , because in R.S you needed the infinitie lives code to win , but in this one you still have to have 3 lives left to achieve it , because even tho you wont get a game over , the end stats still say you crashed or died -3 times , which makes it annoying to stay alive and not commit suicide to get your rockets , or missles back to hom ein on enemys for a much easier and quicker win.When reading things here I thought when they said you could change ships during a mission meant during the game at any time , but thats not the case at all . In a couple of the missions you start off with a ground patrol , or a flight patrol and find your way to a hanger and THEN you select what craft you want to continue the mission with . That idea is ok , I guess.. but doesnt make this game better then R.S.It 's very hard to see vice droids when your shooting at them . They blend in with the back ground color , and there not easy to target for some reason untill your up close to them.The 3 bonus missions arnt much , the most fun I had on one of the missions was the last one , the battle above Naboo . You have to take out the sheilds and radars of that ship Aniken blows up from the inside . It 's short , but not too bad.There are a few changes from R.S , but this one is a downfall compared to it . It 's not as much fun , there not enough crafts , it would have been nice for codes to enable the Falcon or Tie Fighter or X-wings or something ... it 's imposible to get the medals above the Gold rank.This game lacks the fun and adventture the last one had .	-1
I bought this game because people said its better than SSX . Not true at all ! This game is nothing compared to SSX . You should rent this before you buy it ! I am glad this game is so popular because I was able to sell it very easy and fast ! !	-1
Well the answer is in this game . The racing itself as a sport is nothing that makes the player happy , but this game ruins any chances for ATV racing . Its hard to turn and all the cars stink . In freestyle mode , the lamest tricks are only successful when you land it just right . The reason why I did not give it a one is because the graphics are above average and the vast freestyle levels are nice and a little more interesting than the actual racing , which will tire out after ten minutes . If you want a racing game or offroad game wait and rent something like 4X4 EVO or just buy Gran Turismo 3	-1
I bought this game because the sales charts revealed it was a top-seller ... But now that I 've played it , I can only assume that everyone else was as duped as I was . This game is terrible . The graphics , I will admit , are amazing , but the game play is just down-right uninnovated . You ca n't take shortcuts ( even tho the box says & quot ; careen off the dirt path & quot ; ) and the machinery is n't different enough.They did spend a lot of money on the music and instruction booklet , as the first includes tracks from Alice in Chains and Soundgarden and the later which is a full-color 49 page manual . But if you want a good off-road racing game , buy Rumble Racing .	-1
I have no doubt that this is a totally accurate simulation of riding a 4 wheeler . Unfortunatly , the game is not fun at all . It 's totally slow-paced ; the play modes and tracks are all very similar ; the trick-based game is a complete letdown and the game is very difficult . After spending a week trying to get past the third track in pro mode , I gave up on this game . Yeah , maybe I'not good at video games , but SSX was a billion times more fun . I struggled on some courses , and eventually got through . Same experience with Tony Hawk . This , however , is just not a fun game .	-1
Now this game has gotten great reviews . A lot of my freinds have it and love it . But I just dont understand why . Wiping out is cool and a lot of fun on the stunt mode and thats why I gave it the 2 stars . Racing is boring . I tjought ATVs would of worked but I guess they didnt.Better just stick to cars and motorcycles .	-1
Keep in mind that it is an older game and that newer games have spoiled me a bit.The graphics are ok at best , even when comparing it to other games which are about 10 years old . The story is lacking and the game is very linear when it comes to options.I probably would not purchase it again . Not really worth the time .	-1
I just could not get into this game . I really liked Riven , but Myst III does not , in any way , compel me to keep on trying to solve the puzzles in order to get farther . I solved the first major puzzle , which involved lining up reflecting lights in order of color to open a door on an island . It took me a while , but I finally figured it out , and opened the door ... only to find another puzzle preventing me from opening the NEXT door . I mean , come on . I guess I 'm just not a big fan of puzzle games anymore , or something . The story does NOT make me want to solve them , at any rate . It 's slow and sluggish , at least at first ( I never got past the first part , because I was just too bored . ) So , the eagerly-awaited Myst III : Exile is sitting on my desk , collecting dust . I feel absolutely no urge to go play it , although I will give it one star for the pretty graphics.Buy this game only if you really , REALLY like thinking and solving almost-impossible puzzles . Everyone I know who has this game was forced to buy the guide to go with it .	-1
The flower zone is too dull , in fact this whole game is dull , dull , dull . There is no story , and the puzzels are just plain stupid . Spend hours arranging reflectors . I do n't think so.And let me tell you about the flower zone . First of all , the graphics rely on 'jumping ' to the next point , so there is little pathway to follow , given that there is no 3d progress to take you to the next point of play . The screen jumps to your next location in even a more lazy way than Riddle of the Shinx did . Plus , once you have 'landed ' at the next point in the 'jump ' , the stupid game has you turned off the point you 'landed at ' so that you are looking cockeyed . I really hate how that happens ... programmers , please place us facing the way we landed . I am not anal enough to want to figure out how I can go down a path and end up facing a direction I did not turn to face ... I hated Schizm , but I think I hate this more . It is really a bad game . I have played many adventure games , but this is really lousy .	-1
I bought Myst III over one week ago . Until now , I have not been able to play this game at all . Here is why : After installation , the game needs CD-ROM disk 2 in order to start the game . However , after I loaded the appropriate disk , the program did not recognize that it was , in fact , in the drive and kept requesting it.I finally went to the Myst website for assistance . There , I found that Ubisoft & quot ; is aware of the problem and for now recommends to the user to change the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive to 'something lower than H ' & quot ; . Added is a small , short note with a warning that & quot ; changing the drive letter could cause other programs to not work correctly & quot ; . It continues with & quot ; ... We are working on a better fix for the problem ... & quot ; . So of course I am not going to change my drive letters around - who knows what that will do to my system ! While I am happy that Ubisoft apparently is aware of the problem , it bugs me immensely that they would throw such a game out on the market which obviously is n't up to today 's systems . My CD-ROM drive is drive letter N , and I can honestly say that no game I have played in the past has ever had trouble recognizing it.I have now shelled out money for a game that sits on the shelf until Ubisoft comes up with that promised fix - inquiries about how long this will take were not answered to this day . I can only imagine how many more troubles are waiting for me once I 'll get around the disk 2 problem.As to the game itself : I wish I could say something about it . I really do !	-1
Hi , When I first loaded this game I could n't get past the title screen . I e-mailed support and had no luck getting it to work . Based on my negative review here on Amazon , Greg Uhler , one of the games producers , e-mailed me PERSONALLY to try to help.As it turns out , I e-mailed all my information and he gave me a solution right away ! Now the game runs great.I can not thank Greg enough for his personal help ! In case you would like to know what I did : I manually set my monitor resolution to 640x480 and 32-bit color . That 's all it took . BTW I have a voodoo2 12MB , so if you have had any troubles try this ! Rich Rossi -- -- -- -- -- -Old -- -- -- -- -- As many of you know , this game had some serious support problems . I was never able to get it to work even though my computer exceeds all the system requirements . I talked to support , and recieved an answer and a follow up answer ... then nothing . ... .Now I am stuck with a game that will not run on a computer that it is advertized to work on . ... . You have been warned .	-1
I really should not write a review but I am because this game did not in it 's description that is is NOT for Windows 7 ! !	-1
These games expect too much from you . What I mean by that is that everything has to be perfect in the city that you are building in order for the people who live there to be happy.You have to build their houses in a desirable location , otherwise the houses will be of poor quality and the people will move out . You have to make sure that the people have food , water , jobs , are healthy , have a source of entertainment , and have access to religious services . Providing these things for the people will cost money . If you run out of money , you have to find a way to make more money . One way to make more money is to establish a trade route to another area to trade your goods . This can be hard to do because you will have to find an area that will accept your goods and will trade them for other goods that are useful to you but that you ca n't produce yourself . You have to make sure that your city has a strong army of soldiers in case of an invasion . Even if you are confident that the people are happy , it seems like they will always have something to complain about . It seems like businesses always complain that they have too few employees . It seems like no matter how many firehouses and architects ' posts you build , buildings will constantly be bursting into flame or falling to pieces . Your entire city that you have worked so hard on will be in ruins in just a matter of seconds even if you have the best fire and damage protection . And , you have to make sure that the gods are happy . You need to be constantly throwing festivals in their honor , otherwise they 'll do things like send down plagues of locusts or what have you to wreck havoc in your city . What I 'm trying to say is that these games are a little too hard . Also , the games have lots of typos , which can be annoying.These games belong in a 6th grade history classroom to teach kids how hard it was to rule one of these empires . I would not recommend these games to anyone , especially people who are easily frustrated . If you like city-building games , I would recommend Majesty , the Fantasy Kingdom Sim . Now that 's a fun game .	-1
There is no sound . Graphics is very very bad . This game is too old to be played .	-1
I love & quot ; Star Wars & quot ; and related games ! I recently bought & quot ; Rebel Assault & quot ; for the PC , and , frankly , it is an assault on my good taste as a gamer ! I would rather play the original & quot ; Space Invaders & quot ; . This game is horrible and should have been removed from sale years ago . The graphics are poor and lack any finesse , the controls for the ships are slow and useless , the colors are gaudy , and , combined with the lack of definition caused by the poor , smugdy graphics , really hurt your eyes . & quot ; Rebel Assault II & quot ; has to be better than this . I wish I has that instead !	-1
Ok so i bought this from gamestop used for like 5 bucks.And im not gon na complain and say that i wasted my money or anything like that but this game is n't that great.Sure i played it for awhile but it just got to boreing for me.I 'm not gon na explain what you do or what its all about but i will tell you that the gameplay pretty much sucks especialy if your the type that likes free roam games.There are these mini games or whatever you wonna call them i gues to train your character or something i dont really know i did n't play it long enough.Well anyway the bottom line you should really really try before you buy .	-1
This thing is about as ergonomic as a prison bench . The ability to change it from a right handed controller to a left handed one seems like a good idea , but it came with too high a price . -Four of the control buttons are located directly in front of the stick , hard to reach anyway , but they 're only about a mile away from the throttle control ; useless for those ` I got ta hit this button now or I will die ' moments every gamer faces . Because once you move your fingers from the throttle waaaaayyy down to the f1-f4 buttons , its all over . They did this , logically , to save the expense of having to place opposite , mirroring buttons beneath both the right and left throttle ports.Speaking of throttle ... .the wheel based throttle control has about 45 degrees of travel between zero and maximum , way too much for comfort . It forces the user to stretch out the arm too far , which , over hours of gameplay can really become uncomfortable.The stick itself : No doubt you 've noticed from the pictures , there 's this strange looking protrusion from the back of the stick ? ` What could this be ? ' One ponders upon first glance . Well , I shall not keep you in suspense ... .This little plastic protrusion is an incredibly intelligent and novel idea gone sadly awry . The upright ` u ' shaped piece is designed to nicely support your hand , the big muscle beneath you thumb sits atop it , while the flat portion of this device supports the edge of your hand . It 's a great idea executed poorly . Because of its placement , your hand always ends up coming away from the most comfortable resting position in favor of better stick control . It would work very well , if the human body did not have shoulders , that is . This resting point can be moved up and down according to you preference , but it 's just another feature I found completely useless-it stayed where it was when I took it out of the box ... All this thick quagmire of discomfort results in one thing- sore wrists and elbows.The trigger is pretty nice , performs well and is , unfortunately , the most functional thing about this controller . There are three buttons atop the sticks head , they 're very easy to hit , in fact , too easy to hit . Often the user will find themselves executing commands because they 've accidentally hit one or more of these buttons . Like most controllers , there is an eight way point of view or ` hat ' switch up top too . -It works , but it too is much too sensitive due to the length of its design , which gives your finger too much leverage on it and makes it very easy to press sideways when you wanted to press upwards.The customizable features of this controller make it unique ; It 's a fantastically intelligent idea . Too bad Saitek did n't do some research and development utilizing HUMAN hands . The head has three positions : Straight up , angled left , and angled right . I found it to be absolutely , positively , useless . -It stayed straight for my gaming needs ; the angled positions just made it easier to accidentally hit the three buttons up top . Not something this controller needs . There are also three up and down angle positions , which is nice , because you never know when you might want to put the top control buttons as far away as possible so you can place your hand in slightly different uncomfortable position to even out the aches in your wrist , elbow , and shoulder . I mean , hey , why not make your thumb uncomfortable too ? Just to be consistent.Overall construction is n't terrible : It wo n't fall apart if you drop it . But if you 're buying this for your teenager or tend to destroy controllers yourself , look for something a little more substantial . Even the base is lightweight plastic.Now that I 've said everything bad about this controller , how about some of the good : The handling of the stick is very good . There is a nice spring at the base of the stick , making excellent , consistent resistance ... .which translates to good in-game control . The spring also is responsible for returning the stick to center , and it does a dang fine job of it . Twist control , too , is very responsive , and it returns to center very well , which means your gaming screen only rolls or twists when you want it too . ... The only other good thing I can think of about this controller is ... um ... well ... it looks cool , does n't it ? To summarize things : This controller incorporates some very novel , intelligent ideas but executes them about as well as an albatross makes a landing .	-1
This game is not worth your money . Seriously . Consider buying another ps2 game or even 2 dvds . You are almost sure to get a better movie/gaming experience somewhere else . Let me tell you about the game . It takes 4 hours to work your way through the first time ... but actual gameplay is only 1.5 hours . The sad thing is , you wont want it to be longer . The repetitive nature of the game is just awful . Seriously , this game is not nearly as entertaining as double dragon on the super nintendo . You basically take your wooden , stiff character into fights against even less natural opponents and kick butt . This would be fine , but it just goes on and on , and without any real special skill or matters of interest . The graphics are great and the story is only half bad ( which for a game is fine ) , but seriously the gameplay is horrid . Ill give it a star for the graphics but that is IT . Save your money . You would be MUCH better off purchasing DOA : Hardcore or Tekken or even zone of enders . Do not buy .	-1
Do n't get me wrong -- I love Square 's & quot ; Final Fantasy & quot ; RPG 's and was one of the few loyal defenders of the Square / Dream Factory fighter & quot ; Ehrgeiz & quot ; . So I 'm strongly inclined to like this RPG'ish slug-fest.But oh my gosh , is this awful.The gameplay here is a variation on old-school beat-em-ups ( use simple fighting moves to dispatch hordes of drones , move forward through a level , fight a boss , yada yada yada ) . The controls are similar to Ehrgeiz and the Tobal games : full 3-D movement , high/middle/low attack buttons , a simple block button . But there are few combos , the fighting and movement feels slow , and there 's some genuine cheapness to the bosses ... blech ! The graphics , both in-game and cinematics , are wonderful -- in fact , the visuals created by the game engine are often as good as the pre-rendered stuff . And the story , for what it is ( sci-fi action fodder ) , is perfectly agreeable . But you ca n't help but think that the presentation is where all the development time went -- busy as they were with all the visuals , somone forgot to make sure the thing was fun to play.The core of the game is a story-mode , billed on the package as & quot ; Play the action movie ! & quot ; . More like watch some stuff , play a little , watch more , play a little . What 's really painful is when you die in a particularly hard battle , you have to go back to the title screen , reload your game from the memory card , and watch or skip however many movie-scenes transpired between that save-point and the fight you want to restart ( you 'll also suffer the loading-screen between these skipped movie scenes ) . You can literally play for 30 seconds , die , and spend 5 minutes getting back to where you were.Beyond the story-mode , there 's a 4-person slug-fest and a survival mode , neither as engaging as similar modes in real fighting games like & quot ; DOA2 & quot ; .Despite the awesome presentation , this is n't even as good as & quot ; Dynasty Warriors 2 & quot ; , Koei 's far less ambitious PS2 beat-em-up . At least that game could keep the action going for longer than two minutes without becoming boring or stopping for a loading screen.I 'd love it if Square 's & quot ; Final Fantasy X & quot ; had the production values of & quot ; The Bouncer & quot ; ... but I hope it has the gameplay of & quot ; Chrono Cross & quot ; instead of this ambitous train-wreck .	-1
I thought Bouncer might be the perfect game , in which I could sit back between the action and watch hours of beautiful Square full motion video . Sadly the -- game -- part of the Bouncer is pretty darn boring . You fight bad guys in an old school Double Dragons sort of way , wave after wave of them , but it just is n't that much fun . No challenge , no great skill required , except that you must be prepared for pain from your thumb mashing the buttons for 2 hours.The graphics are beautiful , no , beyond beautiful . These graphics are the reason I bought a PS2 in the first place . The story switches back and forth between rendered FMV and movies the PS2 generates itself , and at times I ca n't tell what kind I 'm watching . It does n't matter , the graphics are the best I 've ever seen . However , the story they tell is n't all that interesting , and I always skipped a movie if I have seen it before . Ultimately , the weak story , poor gameplay , and the terrible pace from the combination of the two pretty much make the graphics uninteresting . Pretty , but not worth buying.Do n't buy this game ...	-1
I will start off by saying SHORT . 2 Hrs max . The concept of building up your characters is nice but not worth playing through 3 times to max them out . Also the Story lines for each character are n't worth playing them through either . When you 've seen one you 've pretty much seen them all except for a few scenes and different phrases . The graphics are nice which they should be . Expected more from Square but wait I usually do ... ... and they usually do n't .	-1
The Bouncer has been one of the most anticipated games for the PS2 , and it being a Square title , you 'd figure that it 's well worth the wait ... but dear sweet lord , it 's not . It 's actually the worst excuse for a game that I 've played in years , and Square should be ashamed of even putting this thing up for sale.Basically , The Bouncer is a fighting game with hardly any actual combat ... just loads and loads of cinemas . It 's mostly a non-interactive , interactive movie , with a terrible story ( something about a girl getting kidnapped by some mega-corporation with evil schemes ) , uninteresting and under-developed characters , and an awful game engine . This thing seems to have been created as an show-off vehicle for Square 's art department , and it seems to be little more than self-indulgent demo . If you skip the skads of cinematics , you can breeze through this game in under an hour ( ! ! ! ! ! ! ) and once you 've beaten it , you 're supposed to go back and play with other characters to unlock more hidden features , but once is waaaaaaay more than enough . Combat consists of hitting a few buttons over and over , with little strategy involving moves , because once you gain one decent attack , you 'll pretty much stick with that one time after time . The combat sequences are n't even that long , and you 'll be watching two or three cinemas longer than the actual battle once you 've beaten a level , which is completely absurd . If you 're looking to play one of the worst & quot ; games & quot ; released this year , then RENT but do not buy The Bouncer .	-1
The only good think I have to say about this game is that is does look really good ! The graphics are great but that 's the only great think about this game ! I am totally disappointed with what they did to this game vs. what they could have done ! If you are expecting to see a `` double dragon '' kind of 2 players with out a split screen type of fighting then think again . Next to that , you get the cheesy characters with the same ole cheesy names and cheesy story line ! If you like story based fighting/action games that are very poorly thought out then you will like this one ! Other wise , rent it , play it 2 or 3 times and then promptly return it and count yourself lucky you did n't waste your money on this stink bomb of a game !	-1
Ideally , this is a game you would buy with 2 other friends , each chipping in about 15-20 bucks . Ideally , each of you could play one of the 3 characters as you advance through the story . Ideally , this game -- which is really quite eye-catching and fun to play -- would last you a few weeks . Unfortunately , the latter 2 are not true and you 're definitely better off splitting this game with some buddies rather than plunking down all of the cash for this yourself . I beat the game sitting down with it one night . It is an incredibly short game.That 's not to say it is n't fun . I ended up playing it over and over again to buff up my characters ( you really have to run through the game a few times to get each of the Bouncers pumped up to enjoy it ) . Still , I could n't help but feel cheated that a game that is as expensive as this one is should have lasted longer . When I played Ps1 games like Jedi Power Battles , the Resident Evil series , etc. , they would take me 1-3 weeks at least to finish . Sadly , most of the & quot ; first wave & quot ; of Ps2 games are & quot ; wham bam thank you sony & quot ; .Like any of the first year games , this one is good for the combined fighting tactics you and the computer use to beat the bad guys . It pains me that you could not get that 2nd joystick to work and have a buddy at least partner up with you . If Jedi Power Battles can do that , why could n't this game ? My expectations were set for a & quot ; team up & quot ; game -- and this game allows up to 4 people to play but only in the & quot ; match & quot ; mode.As with any of the new Ps2 games , the story here less coherent than a Goddard film , but it is fun nonetheless . Some of the combat and movie sequences are really cool ( I 'll nominate Dominque 's & quot ; coming out of the closet & quot ; scene as my favorite ) .Although I just got done rating & quot ; X Squad & quot ; with a 3 , and I 'd give & quot ; Warlords & quot ; a 4 stars , this one sadly deserves only 2 . I would buy it used or buy it with a friend so that after the adreniline high of the game is gone , and only 4-8 hours have passed , you 're feel that it was worth it.Oh , this one truly has some of the most absurd & quot ; movie & quot ; moments you 're likely to see in a videogame . I would swear that videogame scripts and plots have a weird aestethic up there with the films of Roger Corman and Ed Wood : dialogue and plot connections so bizarre and painful that they are funny .	-1
Boot-up of SquareSoft 's The Bouncer shows that even a few short months after the Playstation 2 has become available , developers are making games that look great , meaning that even more great looking games are yet to come . Unfortunately , The Bouncer looks amazing , but that 's mainly what you do in this `` game '' & # 8212 ; look.The graphics , both foreground and background are completely amazing . The character designs are first-rate , with details adding to the realism , like the wisps of hair that bounce around on Sion 's head , to the spiked horns sprouting from Volt 's head . The emotions revealed through facial expression are great , but I really felt that I was watching a movie , rather than a PS2 game.Intros ranged from a few seconds to several minutes . They were great to watch , but as the game progressed , they became longer while the parts where having a controller in-hand became shorter.When the controller was in-hand , fighting enemies , the fighting is n't much ahead of Final Fight , or even as far back as the Double Dragon series . While you did have the incentive of beating them to see some more breath-taking scenes , the more you play , the less you want to watch , or even play.Additionally , the camera angles often were pretty bad , with you running toward the camera , making it impossible to see where the enemies were up ahead . There were also times in the subway scene , where you 're running aimlessly to keep ahead of the closing doors and out of the times I did , it never got caught once . There was little challenge here . I think they were included so they could add more time to what was actually interactive on this title.Even though the fights are few and far between , it still gets old pretty quick.Had I bought this one , I 'd be sorely disappointed , because a DVD action movie has a cheaper price tag . SquareSoft incorporated Dolby Digital 5.1 sound during the cinematic scenes and it sounds wonderful , but again , the Matrix is cheaper and more entertaining.The game is n't even that challenging . I 've beat the game with one character within a couple hours of booting it up and am working through with another , but the storyline really does n't change enough ( there are parts , but it 's just not enough ) for this one to be worth much more than a couple hours of play . The local used game store had several copies of it , and now I see why . There 's little replay value in this one.The Bouncer really makes a good showoff piece for the PS2 , but SquareSoft forgot about putting some game in there . If the cut scenes had ended up having more actual game play in between , it 'd be a must-have for the PS2 collection , but as it is , it 's a maybe-rent . ( ... )	-1
The story begins at a bar as a bouncer named Sion is beginning his shift for the day . A quiet morning is abruptly interrupted when a break-in occurs and the intruders manage to kidnap Sion 's friend Dominque . This begins a dangerous rescue mission , as Sion and his fellow bouncers travel far and wide in search of Dominique 's kidnappers.This is the setup to one of the sweetest looking games to come out in a long time . That 's right , Bouncer produces some of the most astonsing visiuls ever . The graphics are topnotch and all the cinamas happen in real time ... cool stuff.While the graphics are good , the major flaw comes with the gameplay . Its mindless button massing , nothing more . The game could be beat by press one button the entire time . This causes the game to get boring and repetive , thus making you want to turn off the game.If the gameplay was good I would n't have mind playing it for its 2 hour playtime . Yep , 2 hours , and that 's it . The game is way to short witch could be good or bad depending on how you look at it . Good side , you do n't have to play this bad game that long to beat it and you could also beat it in the time you rent it . Bad side , its only 2 hours long ... .not worth the money at all.So in the end , you could rent it and beat it just to see the graphics but other than that you could advoid it all together .	-1
This game looks fantastic . It 's visually stunning and works the PS2 's capabilities to a great extent . The sound and cinematics are nice too ... .but that 's about where the fun stops . This is a brawling game where you get to pick one of three fighters in single-player mode . The controls are limited and clumsy ( but the buttons are pressure sensative , which is kind of cool ) . There 's not much in the way of skill here ... mash mash mash , you know ? I was excited about this game , but got instantly bored when I played it for the first time . Thank goodness there 's a return policy at Babbages.Do n't buy this one . It 's short and boring..and pretty slow . Not good for a fighter/brawler .	-1
I have never been a fan of this series but not because I have some bias towards EA . ( I like Madden and other cool EA games ) .Wanting a good baseball game for my overrated PS2 system , I gave this game a shot . First of all , the one good thing : the graphics . I think it has the best graphics out of the three PS2 baseball games.Now the bad : If you want a 1-P game , this game may suit your need if you just want to smash home-runs after another . But for a 2-P experience , DO N'T EVER BUY THIS THING . The batter-pitcher interface has a major flaw which essentially tips the hitter of the pitch location . The end result : games in the 20 runs are not uncommon . This is not baseball .	-1
After playing the outstanding Madden 2001 and the fast paced NHL2001 and NBA 2001 , Triple Play Baseball for the ps2 is a major disappointment . First , the fielding in the game is awkward and slow . It was a major mistake of EA Sprots to drop the automatic fielding option in the game from previous years . Second , there are no historical players , like in Triple Play 2001 . I always thought it was fun to be able to get Babe Ruth off the free agent market . My advice : stick to last year 's version . The improved grphics do n't make the game more fun .	-1
I 've been playing Triple Play Baseball since the 1998 edition . Each year as baseball season rolls around , I 've been duped ( yes , duped ) into buying the latest edition of Triple Play baseball.Never again.Now , let me say this : if you 're not a true , diehard fan of the national pastime , if you do n't get goosebumps at the conclusion of the of the Star Spangled Banner , if the thought of a dog and a beer and the pastoral pleasures of a 2-1 pitchers ' duel do n't appeal to you , then this game may be for you.In short , if you 're looking for a baseball game with all the trimmings of an arcade game on steroids , then you will enjoy this game . On the other hand , if you 're looking for a true baseball sim , then you 'll want to stay away from this game.There are no injuries . There are very few extra base hits . The pitcher/batter interface is simply remedial . ( You know *exactly* where the ball is going to be pitched before it 's thrown ; all you have to do is make sure your cursor is lined up right and gauge the speed . ) You do n't have to warm up the relief pitchers . It 's impossible to strike out the CPU . ( To the other extreme , on All Star Baseball , I had 14 K 's with Greg Maddux , who is NOT a strikeout pitcher . ) There are no walks.In addition , there is no franchise mode . Will we EVER see a game that combines great graphics , actual baseball simulation , great gameplay AND a franchise mode ? On the positive side , the graphics are terrific , and the controls are better than those on All Star Baseball.Simply put , all that 's missing is the keg . Afterall playing this game is no better than playing in an industrial league softball tournament.If you 're a casual baseball fan , this game 's for you . However , if you 're a baseball purist , this game is not for you . Unfortunately , there 's not a single baseball game currently out for the PS2 that 's worth the $ 50.We have to wait until 2002 ...	-1
Wow , where to begin . I popped this game into my PS2 after several months of Sammy Sosa High Heat Baseball 2001 . I had forgotten how crappy the Triple Play series had declined to , but was almost immediately reminded in full as all the bad memories came back . I had to force myself to finish a season last year with TP 2001 . I finished 1st with 116 wins ( only because I quit trying after the all-star break to try and make it a little more competitive ) . I had 95 homeruns and 196 RBI 's with a player I created . I could mention the errors in TP 2001 all day but wo n't because I am reviewing Triple Play for the PS2 . The graphics are a given , as is true with every PS2 game , so there 's no need to goo goo ga ga over good graphics . The gameplay is virtually UNCHANGED from the PS1 series ! ! ! I ca n't believe with today 's technology , they could n't produce a better product . I have n't played the game very much because of terrible boredom , so some of my facts may be inaccurate , but I doubt it . The baserunning still feels like you 're playing T-ball in kindergarten . If you hit a line drive to the wall in right-center , most of the time your runner only gets a single because he 's too slow to make it to second . Not to mention that the runner on first can be thrown out at third ... . on a ball hit to the wall that should be a stand-up double for the hitter , and should score the guy on first with no chance of a play at the plate ! ! ! Instead you end up with a guy on first and third and your next batter will likely ground into a double play to end the inning , which explains why you can have 3 runs on 25 hits when the game is over and batting averages over .700 for the season ! ! The AI ( Artificial Intelligence ) is absulutely horrible . Ex . The computer has a runner on second base . The hitter hits a slow roller through the left side that escapes the SS . It takes the outfielder 10 seconds to get to the ball , which has completely stopped rolling in the outfield , and the runner rounds third and goes back to third every time . EVERY TIME ! The runner never scores from 2nd on a single . The computer never steals bases . The only time you ever get a triple is when the ball is misplayed and rolls to the wall . Then you almost get thrown out trying to stretch it into a triple when it should be a stand-up . At this point I was looking for a single sign that this game was improved from last year 's PS1 version . If there is an improvement , it 's that you have to place the cursor on the ball when you bat . That may help control batting averages a bit . You can still get 3 or 4 hits in an inning and not score a run because of the horrible baserunning and double plays . I almost forgot . I was looking for a way to give me complete control over my baserunners and could n't find one . So every time I hit a ball to the wall and want to run for a double , the AI retreats my baserunner for me and I get one of the longest singles in baseball history . There may be a way to change that but I have n't found it . Nor will I because I 'm probably not going to play it again . The game still seems very choppy . The player movements are still sub-par . Ex . You have 2 outs in the inning and you ground to the first baseman . He snags the ground ball and quickly runs to first base , taps the bag , and jerks back into 1st base position without breaking stride . He should be going to the dugout , the inning is over . I have n't played to game enough to know if it still freezes with 2 outs in the 9th inning . It probably does . Ok , the commentary . When are they going to quit saying those same stupid things that they 've been saying for years . The little stories that Buck Martinez tells over and over again during the same game . The sound of the game blows too . I use to play baseball and never did I hit the ball so hard that it sounded like a blast of dynamite . Is this what EA Sports has to resort to to make thier product more interresting ? You also ca n't change settings in the beginning to turn the stupid soundtrack music off . It plays the same verse over and over and over again . You 're ready to heave the game into the wall before you ever begin . It 's worse than the & quot ; Magic Carpet Ride & quot ; of last year 's . At least Madden 2001 allows you to turn that crap off . There are almost no options in this game . You can not customize your gameplay . No franchise mode ( not that I 'd use it anyway ) , or customized level of play . I could easily win 150 of 162 games with an all-star setting . I think EA Sports has sunk it 's ship with this one . The only EA Sports titles even worth playing are Madden and NHL , and both of those have their problems . Do n't waste your money even renting this one . I 'd love to have my $ 6.35 back . So far I 'm not impressed with PS2 sports titles , but their day is coming . 3DO 's High Heat Baseball 2001 for PS1 is by far the best Baseball Simulation I have ever played in terms of realism and gameplay . Awesome . I have heard great things about Akklaim 's All-Star Baseball series for the N64 . I am eagerly anticipating the arrival of both , but if HH 2002 follows it 's predecessor closely with a few minor changes , I will never need another baseball game . As for EA Sports , sorry , but you need to get on it or get passed by your competition . You no longer reign and your reputation is headed south .	-1
This game is classified as an RPG right ? ? ? ? Well where is the RPG in it ? ? I 'll I see is a Shoot'em up game . I was eager to play this game due to the fact the previous Phantasy Stars were really good . If I wanted a shoot'em up game I would have bought Quake 3 arena . It is an absolute disgrace to call this an RPG . If you are a die hard RPG , which I am , do n't bought this game . Sell you 're dreamcast and get Psx and buy Final Fantasy 9 instead . The only cool thing about this game is that you can set your characters weight , height and features . that is about it . So bottom line is that Sega flopped this one just like they do everything else . I 'll stick with my Psx and Final Fantasy 9 thank you very much .	-1
I bought Phantasy Star Online after Sega shut their servers down and never experienced the online play but from what I read it was the only way to play this game.The graphics are good and the story could pass but the gameplay sucks if you have to play alone . I do n't know why Sega put 4 controller ports on the Dreamcast if I got ta be online to experience the multiplayer aspect.A HUGE disappoitment avoid like stale toast with rotten eggs ! !	-1
... what & quot ; Final Fantasy Tacitcs & quot ; was to the Final Fantasy series ! They both did n't have a lot to do with the series they were based off of . Yet they are both so addictive and fun you just do n't care ! & quot ; Phantasy Star Online & quot ; is one of Dreamcast 's best game and it 's a no brainer as to why it was ! First of all it was made by Sonic Team ( Which is lead by video game master Yugi Naka ! ) , who has a record of making games based on how fun they are ( Games like & quot ; Sonic Adventure , & quot ; & quot ; Samba de Amigo , & quot ; and & quot ; Chu Chu Rocket & quot ; to name a few ! ) , and not on how good they look ( Although they do look good too ! ! ! ) ! The main idea is to log online with up to four friends and chat with them as you kill monsters , unlock doors , find rare weapons , and blow up boxs ! ! ! Although this sounds like it would get boring fast it actually keeps you entertained with the chating part as you and your team-mates can make jokes , flirt with each other , cuss out the bad guys ( Although there is a cencor that blocks cussing ! Sorry , but kids could be playing ! ) , creat your own charicter , and blow up boxes ! ! ! Sound fun yet ? Well if this does n't sound fun to you yet make sure you still have a pulse , you may be dead ! Although I do admitt that unless your online this stuff will be more than boring after 30 minutes ! And since the story is so non-existent playing this game for the story does n't make much sense either ! Basicly , unless you plan on playing this online , you wo n't get your moneys worth if you play it offline ! But Sonic Team has proved one thing : They sure do make some darn good games !	-1
Now , I 've played the later iterations of Phantasy Star , and I loved them . So I bought this to go with my shiny new Dreamcast , thinking I 'd like this one as well . And I 'm sure I would have ... if it worked at all.Let me be the one to tell you , fellow shopper , because no one told me : to play this , you need a Dreamcast modem , which is quite frankly impossible to find anymore , a constant wired connection to a Sega server , and a special serial code , both of which do not exist anymore unless you want to go the hacking route and use cracked codes and private servers , one of which I 'm fairly sure is still illegal and the other of which is time-consuming and requires lots of programming knowledge . In short , you can boot it up , and you can look at it , but there is nothing short of hacking that will allow you to play this . Do not buy , this is a collector piece ONLY , because it has ceased to be functional .	-1
This was one of the more expensive expansion packs I 've ever seen , but sadly , it was also one of the shortest . Though the story of the game is okay , there is really not much new for this , other then the graphical enhancements made in Baldur 's Gate 2 that they back ported to IWD . The new monsters ( actually new , not old ones with a new skin ) can be counted on one hand , and other then one of them - the final boss , they are kind of boring . Unless you have money to burn , this game should be passed on ...	-1
Thats pretty much all i can say	-1
This & quot ; game & quot ; is simply a point at the monster and click and click until he is dead . I custom created the characters but played the actual game for all but 30 minutes and yawned and went to bed . Bor ing . The voices were stupid and not funny at a all . I personally think they should have been left out ! They completely ruined the game for me . Dwarves do n't sound like teenagers , and that 's what the voices were , just like Might and Magic VI+ . Get some serious actors in there or do n't even bother putting voices in at all ! As for the interface , it was tedious and could only be controlled with the mouse , no hotkeys . You click on an envelope and out comes a smiling face saying & quot ; let 's get dangerous & quot ; or & quot ; I 'm yer worst nightmare.. & quot ; something equally stupid . You then deside wheather you want to attack with sword , gun or magic then click on the monster . What a teenage concept , I think I 'll stick with the classic games . Dark Savant , Bane , ect .	-1
I have no idea why this game is so highly recommended by so many.The graphics are dated , and I ca n't imagine why directx 8 is needed for this game.I tried very hard to enjoy it but I ca n't see what 's there that 's new or different.I hate the interface , and have found no way to see your stack or even your own character.In a first person view you should be able to see your other party members , decide who you like , check out their skills and move them around in position , but not possible in this world.I have n't played the previous Wizadry games , and maybe if I had and come along with the story as computer technology progressed , I might find it more interesting , but I do n't really think so.If you are looking for fast paced action , great graphics , and an engrossing story Do n't look here.All in all , Wizardy 8 's only wizardry seems to have been in the pr.1 star	-1
I guess if you spent the eighties playing Wizardry this game really does it for you . For the rest of us it just does n't cut it . The graphics are straight out of 1992 and the control options are sad . You 're forced to pivot your POV around with keyboard keys like a tank turret which completely kills any feeling of suspense . The character development within your party looked promising , but that 's not enough to cary the dated game play . I ca n't believe companies make games like this and put them on shelves next to modern titles and expect to make money .	-1
At first I was very excited about this game . The graphics , combat system , and character development system are well made . I quickly found the battles to be time-consuming and boring . I would sit there while my party battled group after group of wandering monsters , when all I wanted to do is go somewhere nearby . The monsters automatically get stronger as you gain levels . This is a [ jterrinle ] feature , I think . RPG 's should get easier as you gain levels , not more difficult ( it made me not want to raise levels , because the battles only get harder ) . Another annoyance is the way your party is interrupted EVERY TIME it 's your turn to walk or run during combat.I do n't think that anyone could figure out the many clues and quests without the hint book . I certainly could not , and am not about to waste ten or twenty bucks to explore every nook and cranny of this game . The game world itself is small when compaired to simular games . After a week , I have been just about everywhere I can go ( and that 's only after playing about two hours a day ) .	-1
There are a number of people like myself experiencing a slowdown bug that makes the games all but unplayable . Every few seconds the game will pause for a 1/2 second or so ! You might want to wait until a patch is released that fixes this annoying problem . Check the publisher 's message boards for more info regarding this known annoyance . When I get this game working , I 'm sure my rating will be 5 stars once i 'm able to run this game as what i 've seen and heard have been great .	-1
The first thing that comes to mind when a reviewer claims a game is terrible is probably `` oh yeah mister smarty pants , you better be able to back up why you think Mega Man X5 is such a bad game '' . I will try my best . : ) First of all , the gameplay . Being a Mega Man fan since 1993 , I grew up with the original Dr. Wily *and* the X series . I love both . People constantly pick which one they think is better , but in the end , I always found shooting robots incredibly fun and I still find it rewarding and addicting to play through a Mega Man game over and over searching for the very best way to blast through a stage and eliminate the enemies , along with finding the best way to defeat the boss at the end of the stage . Mega Man is mainly supposed to be a side-scroller shooter . THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ( sorry , big words make it easier to get my point across ) .What does Mega Man X5 do ? It mostly abandons the need to really use your X-blaster for anything important , except for the stage bosses . It makes me absolutely SICK TO MY STOMACH ( sorry , the big words need to return ) that Capcom chose to make at least half of the stages almost completely empty . I do n't know the name of the stage , but the forest level has almost NOTHING TO SHOOT . You basically spend the entire time in this level just dash-jumping your way through , until you arrive to the end boss . Oh okay , there are a couple things to shoot . Lazily-designed and completely unmemorable bad guys are featured inside this forest stage ( did I mention the backgrounds are bland-looking ? ) When you arrive to these enemies ( I think one of them is some kind of robotic plant , but I may be wrong ) you actually have to wait a few seconds for them to shoot something uncreative and boring at you ( which incidentally does very little damage ) . Why am I WAITING for a slow-poke enemy to shoot something at me ? And in a MEGA MAN game , where speed and avoiding attacks is supposed to be the key to completing the game ? BORING ! Anyone who tries defending the stage enemies in this game is going to have an extremely tough time.I wish that forest stage was the only problem with Mega Man X5 , but sadly it 's just the beginning . I ca n't stand this game . I ca n't stand the fact that Capcom removed *every single thing* I love about the Mega Man series . It 's like the company has something personal against me.What to talk about next ... okay , everybody hates the fact that the stage bosses are named after Guns 'N Roses band members . This does n't really bother me ( even though I passionately hate Guns 'N Roses and think they are nothing but a sorry Aerosmith imitator rock band with a whiny , overrated lead singer ) . I hate the fact that every stage boss can be defeated with *just* your X-buster . Remember how important it was in past games to find the right weapon to successfully destroy the end boss ? Not now . Each stage boss has ugly and lazy animations , and they move across the screen so slowly that it 's very easy to just continue shooting at them with the X-buster while avoiding their lazy , slow attacks . Believe it or not , all eight stage bosses can be defeated this way . So much for strategy . What a worthless game.Whenever Capcom tries to make a Mega Man game tell a good story , the gameplay suffers as a result . This game is the biggest offender . The worst part is that they removed the cutscenes you were introduced to in Mega Man X4 . Now you have to scroll through boring text as the characters have their boring conversations , building no suspense whatsoever during critical moments . Lengthy and frequent text-scrolling is what X5 is all about.Oh , and let 's not forget that Capcom just threw in a bunch of new friends to help guide Mega Man through the game . I highly doubt anyone cares about these characters because Capcom just PUT them in the game and expected us to care about them without any kind of interesting history or connections to other Mega Man games . Does n't work that way . Even if they were returning characters from the Wily series it would n't have bothered me . The fact is , these new characters are a bunch of nobodys and even when you beat the game , they will remain nobodys.Speaking of characters guiding you through the game , your female friend Alia INSULTS YOUR INTELLIGENCE numerous times throughout the game . While you dash and shoot your way through each of the eight unmemorable stages ( that is , when you actually arrive to something worth shooting ) she will CONSTANTLY appear on screen to bug you and tell you *exactly* what it is you have to do . This means more inconvenient text-scrolling . Sometimes she interferes with your progress so often that you just wish there was a way to shoot and kill her . It 's incredibly annoying . After finding out how disappointing X5 turned out to be , the LAST thing you want to do is put up with someone like Alia basically calling you a moron.Alia insults your intelligence by telling you to do VERY simple things that anyone with ANY past experience with a Mega Man game would be able to understand without needing any pointless instructions . She actually has the nerve to say things like `` jump over that wall '' . I THINK we already knew that . Why ? BECAUSE WE 'VE HAD TO DO THE SAME THING *MANY TIMES* IN THE PREVIOUS FOUR X GAMES AND *MANY TIMES* IN THE WILY GAMES . WE 'RE NOT DUMB ! ! ! The challenge in each stage ranges from very easy to incredibly difficult , which is quite surprising to me because the challenge in past X games was a lot more consistent . The already mentioned forest stage is worthlessly boring , but more specifically , a cakewalk . However , the flipside to that are really frustrating stages that require excellent , fast-moving timing in order to complete . So throughout the game you will go from incredibly simple stages where you do n't even have to shoot at anything , to incredibly difficult stages where you are sure to die many times until you get it perfectly right . I LIKE FUN MEGA MAN GAMES . Not this inconsistent mess.The game becomes almost excruciatingly difficult when you arrive to the very first stage in Sigma 's castle . The stage is ripped off completely from the Quick Man stage in Mega Man 2 . Remember jumping down and avoiding those laser beams ? Same thing . In this game , trying to complete this task is MUCH harder.At least three stage themes are pretty good . That 's it . That 's the only thing Mega Man X5 has going for it . Oh , and speaking of music , the theme in one stage is just an updated version of the water stage theme from Mega Man X2 . I especially hate this stage because it 's one of those stages where the screen pushes you to the right , and you have no control over it . You are forced to go with the flow while avoiding shots from a giant underwater robot . So much for fast-pace shooting/dashing action . I hate this underwater stage more than the previously mentioned forest stage . At least with the forest stage I can go `` duh '' and daydream my way through the empty thing . Stare at the ceiling while you play through the forest stage . I bet you can make it to the end boss ! Look , I love Capcom and think they 're a wonderful company that does a fantastic job with action games , but they really screwed up with Mega Man X5 . Please avoid . I ca n't be angry at a company that gave us so many good games , but when a game is rushed to the market and I believe no creativity or effort whatsoever was involved during the process of creating the game , it HAS to be mentioned . That 's what I did just now . Told you why Mega Man X5 is so freakin ' awful . A lazy and unremarkable experience . The game has no life.Every company has their bad games , and this is clearly `` the bad game '' from Capcom . Just pick up Mega Man X4 to find out what a really good action game should be like . I can only imagine what X6 must be like .	-1
Nothing could have prepared me or any other true Mega Man X fan for how much they messed this game up . Apparently there was a staff shake-up before it came out , something that would not surprise me one bit . It seems that these new people wrote up a list entitled `` Ways to make the players hate us . '' Here 's why.1 ) Why did they mess up the armor system ? I was surprised and disillusioned to see you start off with the X4 armor . Was n't a lot of the fun in the first 4 games starting off with nothing and finding stuff as you went along ? It also does not help that they RUINED the plasma gun from X4 and no longer let you shoot through walls . Sure there are capsules in X5 , but now it 's eight instead of four for two sets of armor . That may sound cool , but acquiring them is more annoying than fun . You ca n't even use an upgrade when you get the capsule . You have to wait until you get all four pieces to the SAME armor before you can use ANY part you get . Of course it does n't help either that both the armors suck . Neither of them looks appropriate for a general armor that would come to mind if you think `` Mega Man X5 . '' When you think about the first game , you can think of the completed armor he had in it . In X5 , both the armors look too specialized , and that 's exactly what they are . The Gaea Armor has kind of a cool gun that of course breaks certain blocks , but it is no fun to use because you can only move very slowly in it , and you ca n't even mid-air dash or use weapons in it . The Falcon Armor lets you fly for a period of roughly five to ten seconds , but when I first saw the powered-up gun for the Falcon Armor , I was n't sure if I was kidding myself or not by what I saw . It is the worst gun X has ever had . Mega Man 's Mega Buster from Mega Man 4 back on NES would blow it off the face of the planet , even the universe . How they could make a gun this pathetic is beyond me . Simply put , one armor 's all gun and no movement , and the other 's all movement and no gun . Where 's the balance here ? A good armor would have at least SOME balance.2 ) For those who have n't played X5 , you will be stopped frozen at least five times a stage forced to read annoying text messages transmitted to you from some stupid new ally named Alia who you 'll just want to kill more than anything else . Think of Navi or the owl from Legend of Zelda Ocarina of time except 100 times worse . No , there 's no way to skip or shut off Alia unless you 're revisiting the stage and already listened to it ( with the same character ) . If the text messages were interesting and useful , it may have been pardonable , but no . Instead we 're babysat with lectures like `` Do n't jump on the spikes . You 'll die ! '' `` Get off the train ! It 's exploding ! '' I do n't ever recall playing a Mega Man or X game to be babysat . The new staff must have thought that all of us Mega Man veterans out there never progressed beyond 5 years of age . They obviously never did , so it 's quite possible . Alia is shown with her with her mouth wide open wearing some sort of earphone device in the mission report screen in between stages ( a part that has the some of the worst Mega Man or Mega Man X music ever created ) . I 'd love so much to stick a piece of dynamite in her wide open mouth and never have to listen to her again . I 'd love to do even worse to the morons who made this game . Where did Alia , Signas , Douglas , and all these other dorks come from anyway ? Even at X8 it 's a mystery.3 ) There is absolutely NO creativity or set of new ideas in this game . This is quite obvious considering that they brought back the Rock Monster for the boss of the first Sigma stage , the eye boss from the first game for the second Sigma stage , a time stopper weapon , the Quick Man laser beams , the Mega Man X capsule music for capsules , Bubble Crab 's music for Duff McWhalen 's stage , and much more . Yes , you read correctly . There is a boss called Duff McWhalen . This brings the review to the bosses . It 's hard to contemplate how much they must have thought about different ways to make the bosses suck . Just look at their names . Izzy Glow ? The above mentioned Duff McWhalen ? Dark Dizzy ? The Skiver ? Axle the Red ? Are these supposed to be cool boss names ? The bosses in battle are not exactly inspiring either . Most of them are just so ridiculously slow . How long does the fat bear boss float through the air with his arms shaped as if he wanted to give you a hug ? I 've lost count ... How long does the bat boss just slowly fly around the room and shoot NOTHING at you ? It can vary , but either way it 's awfully long . And did they even know that the firefly boss IZZY GLOW looks like he 's defecating when he does his laser attacks ? Did they know that the fight with the horse boss of the sky stage is on an airplane much like Storm Eagle 's from X1 ? Did they know this boss even does some of the EXACT SAME attacks as Storm Eagle ? If I wanted to , I could find something bad to say about EVERY stage , boss , and weapon ( of which X 's none are cool or original ) in the game , but I 'll let players deduce that for themselves . The only good thing I can say about the bosses is that I wish the squid boss were in another game because he 's the only one close to cool ( but not the weapon he gives X ) .I have never heard worse boss music before X5 . You can disagree with me if you want , but I really thought the boss music in X4 was exceptional , at least for Mega Man X boss music . It was energetic and put you in a fighting mode . X5 's goes to sounding like some AWFUL messed up version of some dumb pop song . I really wonder if they tested this game at all . They obviously did n't test their own intelligence or capability.4 ) X5 is simply almost no fun to play . X is just horrible . His attacks and weapons suck , and he does practically NO DAMAGE to bosses , even with the right weapon . You 'll be fighting bosses for ten minutes in the later stages with X unless you use the restrictive Gaea Armor or pick up the Ultimate Armor . Having X and Zero available the whole game instead of choosing to play the whole game as one or the other may seem like a good idea at first , but it ended up being more frustrating than beneficial . You have to figure out how to divide up the heart tanks , and Zero ca n't even get some of them . You also have to revisit nearly every stage if you want to get everything , taking away from the players any motivation to form their own strategy , order , or way of playing in general . There were absolutely NO new ideas or stage creativity or at ANY point in the game . Some of the stages could just be cruised through with the Falcon Armor in under a minute . Stage brevity has always , in my view , been a problem of these games , but X5 is the only instance in which I would not complain . Wonder why ... The whole time limit thing was also retarded . All it did was prompt more annoying speech from Alia such as `` You do n't need to be here '' if you picked a stage that did n't have a part for whatever you needed at the time.There are not a whole lot of good things about this game at all . Zero 's crescent saber from the bear boss is cool , but that 's about it . This game is a miserable excuse for an addition to the Mega Man X series . I wish I could have flown over to Japan and fired every single Capcom staff member who had anything to do with this game . X5 is not a good game on any terms . People who write reviews saying it 's good or `` Just another Mega Man game , '' do NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT . My guess is that the makers probably thought about `` innovation , '' a word I have grown to hate . `` Innovation '' in the modern sense of the word , does not have a place in the formula with the Mega Man X games . The `` innovation '' in these games should come in the stage design and background , boss ideas , and weapon ideas . It should NOT include messing up a whole foundation . They put all this garbage in X5 and expect players to be happy because of a new ability to duck ? ? Sorry , I 'll take no ducking any day . As the result of this failed attempt at `` innovation , '' X5 was the beginning of a period of disappointment that would last for the next few games . I 'll admit that I own the game being a fan ( though by now possibly a former fan ... ) , but even now I still want some form of brutal vengeance against Capcom for this bitter disappointment .	-1
I suppose I felt gracious that Capcom felt the need to bring the X series back after so many months ( and years ) in between 4 and 5 , but THIS is n't what I had in mind . X4 was such a mind-blower that I was worried that any successive X titles would n't be able to hold a candle to it , and dammit if I was n't right . Thanks to the `` efforts '' of Capcom Production Studio 3 , there 're just too many things wrong with this title , namely a few too many changes in the formula that were both beneficial ( the ability to duck ) and problematic ( not being able to shoot through walls ? ? ? FAIL ! ) , and some of the worst boss designs and weapons made for the X series up to this point ( I also was n't too pleased with every boss being named after members of GUNS AND ROSES ... I hate that band ) . Then again , the level designs were pretty good , the switching between X and Zero between levels was a nice entry , the visual effects were n't bad , both armor types had their definitive uses and the plot was nicely done , but the influx of new characters , all those changes and the whole sense of finality made this the worst game in the X series and thus kept me from enjoying this as fully as I'd 've liked ( Inafune wanted to end the series on 5 , thus all the attempts at tying up the loose ends plot-wise ) . I was actually quite glad , in the end , for the introduction of X6 , as I wouldn't 've wanted the X series to end with such a flop .	-1
this expansion pack [ is really bad ] ! the livin large one was great but this one has nothing more than music and food . the dancers u can higher dont take off NONE of their clothes and u cant higher more than one entertainer at a time . the things that ARE good in this game are a birthday cake , punkin and the campfire.and also the all girl and all boy bathroom . once u buy the birthday cake , you are already starting a birthday party , u can choose who 's birthday it is that day . this expansion pack doesnt come with the vibromatic heart bed either . when u get the sims house party you will feel like you are playing the original sims .	-1
What 's new ? You can screw up your Sims ' lives , inject some romance or have them partying like wild dogs , other than that , what 's new ? Sadly nothing . Nothing at all.The Sims Expansion : House Party is basically an add-on pack that focus on the social interaction of your Sim ( s ) . New Party items such as costumes , toys and an & quot ; improved & quot ; way to call your Sim friends are in this package.This is what I liked about this package . The new items , such as those electrifying cages , the time-saving pre ordered meals , the groovy disco floor tiles and the mechanical rodeo that somehow really add a punch to the whole & quot ; party & quot ; package , but that is all I find interesting about the expansion pack . To tell the truth , I kind of regretted buying it .Here is what I hate about this package . Unlike the previous expansion pack , The Sims : Livin ' It Large ( which I enjoyed tremendously ) this expansion pack does n't have new neighbourhoods to build new Sim homes for . Sadly , most of the & quot ; new-items & quot ; in The Sims Expansion : House Party does n't seem to be a big help to throw parties at all ! And let 's not talk about the party crasher ! Instead of adding fun to the game ( hey , it is fun to see your Sims screw up you know ) , this guy adds frustration ! The gameplay is still basically the same . Click to have your Sim do this or that . Take care of their needs or forget about it to mess up their lives . Yawn . Intially , half the fun of playing The Sims comes from the humorous ways your Sims acts . Unfortunately , the game actually gets boring after playing it for a long time.The Sims Expansion : House Party could have been a great expansion pack to buy if it ACTUALLY had some new features ( hey EA ! Why not make the Sims fly ? ) . Same old boring game with same old boring concept.Do n't get this game unless you are a die-hard Sims fan . Save your money for something else .	-1
This game is the worst in its genre . After the 2nd quake , which was also bad , came something even worse quake 3 arena . After playing the pc , then renting the game for ps2 i realized that both were bad . Terrible controls , you ca n't win on normal diffuculty since the guys kill you easily , and the arenas are small and are terrible-looking graphics . Do n't buy this game , it is a waste of time and money !	-1
Fortunately , I bought this game at Half-priced books , used . Mind you , I 'm an action/adventure gamer , so you folks who love these kind of games might find it fantastic . To me , it 's absolutely and painstakingly slow ! I thought something was wrong with my mouse , because it took forever for me to turn around in a room . Nope . I checked it out and the mouse is fine . So it 's something to do with the game . It 's one of those games you ca n't interact with . You have to find the clues and sometimes when you aim the cursor at the clue , it does n't highlight , so you miss it completely . Not good for THIS type of game . I have to say , I 'm just starting the game and using a walkthrough . Still , even with the walkthrough , the clues are n't showing up and it takes forever to get them to show up and work ! The graphics are pretty good . I 'll give it that . But holy perogies ... How do you people enjoy these types of games ? It 's so damned boring ! I like games where you can interact with the environment ; where you feel like YOU are part of the game . So far , this does n't cut the mustard ( whatever that means ... ) . I 'll probably try a little more tomorrow and the next day before I finally get tired of wasting so much time just trying to move around . Click here and wait ... Dum dee dumm ... Ok finally . Now , click here and wait ... Dum dee dumm ... Thanks but no thanks . I 'll stick to my action games where I can at least move the character at will . I had to give it two stars because the graphics were good and the atmosphere WAS spookey . But , in my opinion , do n't buy this game new . Unless , of course , you 're the type who enjoys these tedious , slow , poorly controlled games . I can usually tell within a few minutes whether I like a game or not and I do n't like this one . Nope . No questions about it .	-1
I just received my Dracula 2 game from ... today . That 's the good news . When you open the box the only thing inside is the jewel case which contains the two CD 's and the worlds shortest & quot ; manual & quot ; .There appears to be no way to change the resolution settings , color settings , sound or anything else . Or re-map the keyboard . Keyboard ? There is nothing in the & quot ; manual & quot ; which shows keyboard assignments . How do you move forward ? Who knows . Backwards ? Run , walk or jump ? Who knows . Want to use mouse invert ? Sorry about that.Having played PC games for a couple of years now I am conditioned to the fact that you 're gon na get ... sometimes , and this is one of those times . Think of it this way : I get to have turkey in April , because Dracula 2 : the Last Sanctuary is a turkey ( and it 's not even Thanksgiving yet ! ) .	-1
Welcome to the worlds most boring game . When I ran this game for the first time I was very impressed with an introductory movie that was very long , detailed and creepy . I could n't wait to start playing to see more of that . However , once I started playing I was dissappointed with this game and it 's over-simplicity.There are only certain places that you can move to . Want to go check out that dark corner over there ? Forget it , you ca n't . You can turn around 360 degrees but only move in one direction , go figure . You collect different items and solve different puzzles and that 's all this game really is . It 's a pretty puzzle game . There are no special effects and no movement by the monsters . They just stand there and grunt at you.Not to mention this game is so pathetically easy that my four year old son could play it with no problems at all.Do n't buy this game . ... .	-1
First I want to say that I am a huge baseball fan , and that WSB 2K1 was completely underrated and 2K2 is equally overrated . 2K1 had hands down the BEST GRAPHICS I 've ever seen in a sports game . The pitching and batting of all players was right on the money , a perfect 10 . Full motion , breaking pitches looked so sharp , you could even see the seams ! While the fielding was automatic , the plays looked realistic and had full motion and extreme detail . The editor was fabulous too , although I would n't mind changing the height and weight too ! It 's wrong to call 2K1 a failure ( an example of failure would be all 3 baseball games on PS2 ) , because if only the fielding were changed to manual , that would have been the greatest game of all time . Meanwhile in 2K2 , I lost hope . To start , the graphics are n't even close to 2K1 , pitching and batting motion is strange , even cartoon like . Also , pitches do n't break AT ALL- a fastball looks just like a screwball . Batting stances are n't correct ( especially Bonds ) , and balls outside the strike zone are still strikes . To continue , yes , you have manual fielding , but a normal 6-4-3 double play is almost impossible , because it seems as though everyone is as fast as Maurice Green . Plus the fielders dive way too far , but at least they can jump . To add to that , the editor is [ weak ] too . You ca n't even change the faces , pitching stance , or batting stance , so it 's all a clone team . Then to top that off , as the GM ( who 's suppose to have control ) ca n't even trade half the people you want to because of NO TRADE contracts . That 's poor . Hitting is far too difficult , and in 2 player mode , you ca n't even hide your pitch . The only pluses I can give are exceptional commentary , online play , and home run derby . This game needs much improvement .	-1
My goodness ... all these five star reviews really awe me ... I 've been a strong dreamcast player even years after it fizzled out early in the previous console wars . Sonic Adventure one was very fun game to play , but like most other dreamcast titles it was flawed . Those flaws were strongly outweighed with the many upsides of that title . I did n't give Sonic Adventure 2 a 1 star review because many people , including my own brother enjoyed this game . It also had a decent following.On a personal level however I feel they kept all the flaws from the original game , took out all the previous positive changes , and slapped a title on it . I was very disappointed . If you own the dreamcast I 'd recommend getting the original before this one .	-1
If you already own part one ( like I have ) then do n't expect to be blown away by part 2 . The arena is a similar & quot ; city & quot ; setting , with no time differential . You 're still driving during daylight . You can not drive at night . So the only difference is the fact that your car can jump.My biggest complaint is about the mini games . In order to unlock the hidden stages , and scecret characters from part one , you are forced to play the mini games , which are VERY ... VERY ... VERY ! ! ! difficult to beat.Why did n't the progamers include easy button entry codes , like they do with other games ? I like challenges but why should I spend 4 hours trying to get my car to jump from one rooftop to another .	-1
I did not enjoy the controls on this game . The only entertaining part with the somewhat nudity that came with the game . You know what they say , `` Sex sells . '' Well if that was their only selling point then I wo n't hold my breath for the next one . I would rather get a girlie mag for excitement . Definatly not for kids . I must say though , this is the first game I put down in one day . I gave Batman and Robin a 3 day chance before I put that one down .	-1
This is a comic book . With too much plot . Endless pages of text dialog you must scroll through before getting to even a very short action sequence . Even the action is dull and has too much dialog . After a while , I quit reading and just kept pushing the buttons to get through the text and get to some action . If you 're looking for action - look elsewhere .	-1
I just bought this game because I needed a baseball game for PS2 and I 'm a big Guerrero fan . Oh , how I was disappointed . The game play is actually pretty good . I like the fact that there 's no cursor for batting . It really feels like it takes some baseball knowledge to play , as you have to guess kind of pitch and location , which I actually got pretty good at after playing about 20 games . However , this does n't overshadow the many cons of the game.There are a laundry list of problems with the game . The scenes where the players walk to the plate is choppy . The dugouts are empty . Sometimes when you hit a homerun it looks like the guy is running across the plate from the first base side . The pitcher is choppy when throwing a pitch , and after throwing a pitch he goes straight back to his original stance , so he 'll go instantly from crouching forward in front of the rubber after a pitch to standing on the rubber with no transition . The batter goes from the end of his swinging motion right back to his original stance ( pretty much the same as the complaint about the pitcher ) . The umpires spin around as the & quot ; camera & quot ; spins around them , which looks stupid , but not as stupid as the fact that they have faces on both sides of their head . If the camera is rotating and you are pressing forward , your player runs in circles , because the controls are in relation to the view on the screen . I know there 's more , but I do n't have all day.The problems seemed insignificant at first , but they pile up quickly and become very irritating . The game play is good , I do n't know why 3DO had to cheap out when it came to touching up all the graphics parts of the game . The most irritating part is that the problems would have been easily fixable with a little bit of work . It 's not like they were major bugs in the game . Neglecting these problems just looks like laziness on the part of 3DO , and it is that fact that will lead me to buy All-Star Baseball when the 2003 baseball games come out .	-1
If you buy a game for graphics , then this is a game to buy . However if you buy a game for game play then this is not the game for you . Do n't be fooled by other peoples reviews , well over half the game is movie , and I for one did not buy the playstation 2 to watch movies . The entire game you just run from one movie to the next , never really doing anything except maybe picking up a key . The problem solving is very simple as well , so simple in fact that it took me an afternoon to complete the game , my total time was like a little over 10 hours . Save your money and do n't buy this cheese fest of a game .	-1
I remember playing this game when I was very young at my brothers friends house , and I was addicted to it . I have fond memories of it and wanted to play it again , but good lord , how ... how did I play this when I was little ? Its very annoying . You ca n't save your progress , if memory serves right ( I have n't played it in a while , though still have it ) , and it automatically saves as you progress through the game . Well , for me , I do n't know what happened , I was at one part of the game , progressed , and then the timer kept running out before I could even walk anywhere and the character dies . So , this means I have to start the whole entire game over again , because each time I load my saved progress the a few seconds and boom , I 'm dead . GRR ! But , other than that , the plot is just plain amazing . If you 've watched , and are a fan of the anime `` Full Metal Alchemist '' , you 'll probably love this . The main character is basically trying to defy his fate of death , trying to find out who it is who keeps trying to kill him . During your quest you 'll find some ties to the scientific religion of alchemy , and meet a lovely woman who somehow becomes involved in this scheme . Every choice you make in the game determines the ending , if memory serves right there are 3 alternate endings ( I would n't quote me on that ) . You must travel to different times , some quite distant ! And defy your fate . I do adore the game , and the plot , but argh , its so frustrating !	-1
Snore fest . Maybe this would have been fun in 1995 , but here in 2009 this game is a bore . You 're limited to 3 weapons and this has a very 80 's arcade feel to it , only even more lame . This game is a wast of time and effort . Pass on this one .	-1
This is the worst shooter game I have ever played . Weapons are pathetic , movement is akward , and aiming is purely painful . When I see the name KOIE on any other game I will certainly know not to by it . Seeing the 4 star average rating on this site makes me think that most of these reviews are bogus . ( Has anyone ever seen a game with a poor rating on this site ? I have not . This game diffenitly deserves a zero . ) It disgusts me that there are games of this crappy nature allowed on the market . Give me a break .	-1
So get this , I play this game on normal the second to last level . Meaning one more and it was the final boss . I went through hell.The game has you go through really tough things , and really boring environments . The hard part of the game is really the backtracking . I never needed a strategy guide , but jeez man what is this . Once I got underground , I had to backtrack like 8 times.So the second to final level had me going under lasers again . After I narrowly got by the lasers , I had to go on a catwalk to a small room . There was no cover across the catwalk , and it was easy to die . I ran across for my life to the room which was to the right of the catwalk . Right when I step in the room a missle comes at me and I lose all of my health , and my place . I had to restart from before the lasers.The games mechanics are fine , the bots are boring though . The longer you play , the more times the nuclear bomb thingy goes off . It went off once during my whole time , and that was right before getting to the underground.The game itself is boring . I hated bactracking , and I hated how the enemies always had the upperhand . It was relatively easy somewhat , but powerups and life refills were hard to find , so alot of the time I was at low health , knee deep in baddies.Again , the backtracking is horrible . But also the lasers . My gosh , you have to avoid these lasers on a roof and at the second to last level . The lasers are HARD to get by . You have to do split second reactions.You can only save once a level is complete , so get ready to make commitments . You ca n't reload from continues so you better finish that level.Again , I hate this game for making the second to last level so hard . Honestly , keep the level of difficulty at medium . How hard is it to make the game easier . Koei decided to make all that time I spent worthless , o and there was no way to beat the guy with the rocket launcher unless I had thousands of health , or a cheat on . I will never cheat , so that is that .	-1
I rented All Star Baseball 2002 by Acclaim as everything I 've read thus far puts it ahead of the other two baseball sims available on the market , but let 's hope the reviews I 've read were wrong , because there 's not much here that I liked about the game.I will note that I 'm writing this review after playing it for an hour and a half against my roommate . To be fair ( and also to get my money 's worth from renting the game ) , I 'll dive into the game again tomorrow morning , but initially I was pretty appalled at the product that Acclaim has released here.As soon as we finished playing , I sat down and wrote up the good and the bad about this game , and found I had trouble finding much good in this game.One thing that I liked a lot and my roommate liked very little was the batting and pitching . The batting is a lot different than Triple Play was on the PSX . ( I 've yet to play Triple Play for the PS2 , but think that 'll be one of my next reviews ) . While other games tend to make hitting overly easy , this sways a little too much in the other direction , but I think it 's a good thing . Rather than swing high , mid or low , you have total control in two axis and you get an idea via the pitching cursor where the ball is starting out and then as it approaches the plate . I applaud Acclaim for this interface and I think with a little practice , this control scheme would be my interface of choice for my baseball sims.That being said , the rest of the game is garbage . The controls are lame . Partially Blockbuster 's fault , we did n't have a manual , but the base throwing is different and it seems it 's different simply to be different . Every baseball game out there PSX , PC , NES , whatever used the control pad and a button to throw - down and X to throw home , left and A to throw to third , or something similar . ASB 2002 uses X , Triangle , O and Square as the base throwing . After being trained since back in the 8-bit days to use the control pad , using the buttons seems unnatural . Had using the buttons given some advantage or speed increase , Acclaim would be revolutionary , but just to be different to be different is lame.Eventually one could get used to their control scheme for that , but there are more controlling woes . Another unwritten rule is the fact that Triangle is used to back out of menus . This is true for 99 % of American games out there . Acclaim uses O to back out of menus , which is more the standard in Japanese games , but Acclaim , this is the United States . Again , this is a little thing , but it 's just another annoyance.My real lament here is the game does n't feel like the PS2 . I pulled up Triple Play 2000 for the PSX and yeah , textures , characters and shadows are head-and-shoulders above the PSX stuff , but I 've seen Madden and SSX . The PS2 can do more than what ASB 2002 is doing ! The animations in the game felt very amateurish . A fly ball to the warning track had my roommate settling under the ball . It looked decent , but he had no control . I 've got to vote for total control over pretty animations . Also , in terms of the outfield , there was some noticeable blur/jitter-type distortion when the fielder threw back to the infield - unacceptable in anything but a beta version of a game.Additionally , a grounder to second and then the routine throw to first never looked routine . Every time , the second baseman wound up to throw , he faced toward home , making me fear I had accidentally told him to throw home . Magically , the ball would throw to first though . There 's no excuse for animation like that with present-day technology.Another thing that should be long forgotten in present-day gaming systems is crappy commentary . The commentary was reminiscent of Hardball 3 back in the day for the PC . There 's no color or any real chatter . A lot of the sentences sounded pieced together and I ca n't remember hearing anything that bad since back in the days of 286 computers.Overall , this game is lame . Once I play it more , and also check out Triple Play for the PS2 , I will consider revising my opinions , but based on my first play , I do n't think I 'll be getting a Playstation 2 baseball sim until at least next season .	-1
[ ... . ] Any team can become the champs of all the teams . You can be the darn expos and be about 100 games above 500 . The sliders break too much and the curveballs are just between a change up and a fastball . the first one you throw is always awesome . Acclaim needs to make the game a little harder . The batting stances are outta wack . The brewers my favorite team is underrated ( of course ) . With good players you hit 500 homeruns a year . on the back of the box they say franchise debut but there is no franchise [ ... . ]	-1
There 's good news and bad news with Z.O.E . The good news is that MGS2 will be the greatest game ever . Heck , the extremely short demo packed with Z.O.E . is currently the greatest game ever ! The control is a dream , the graphics are poetry in motion , and the re-playbility is unheard of . When Metal Gear Solid 2 : Sons of Liberty rolls around , the PS2 will be THE place to be . That 's the good news.The bad news is that Z.O.E . is none of the things MGS2 is . The story is melodramatic , the voice acting is horrendus , and Leo is the most unlikeable hero in video gaming history . The graphics are good and there is a great attention to detail , but there is no variety . Every level has Leo 's bot simply destroying the same three enemy bots and the occasional boss . The control is excellent , but this game is ultimately just NO FUN . The selection of weapons is sub-standard and fighting through level after level of the same old thing is down right boring . Finally , for a game with a rating of & quot ; M & quot ; , Z.O.E . should have had a more mature storyline . The main characters are pre-teens with incredibly annoying , horribly high voices . Z.O.E . is like a bad episode of Digimon or Power Rangers . Do n't let the good graphics fool you , this is a horrible disappointment of a game . Buy it for the excellent MGS2 demo , or save your money or a video game that 's fun , because Z.O.E . is NOT !	-1
once you end it youll never play it again , just the first part of soulreaver its & quot ; half a game & quot ; we as the consumer should sue them for making 50 % not 100 % percent of a game .	-1
Well , It seems that you ca n't trust Konami . They come out with great games like Metal Gear Solid , but also produce [ junk ] like this . The demo disc , well it 's worth it , but you can buy the game now . The gameplay is horrible . It 's just a giant robot collding into other robots in order for them to explode . WOW ! And that awful awful AWFUL soundtrack . [ Bad ] techno with a singer who 's genitals were ripped open by fishing knives . The voice acting [ stunk ] , espicially Leo ... Bad game . Do n't waste your time .	-1
This game was too ambitious . By including so many ages , it spread itself to thin to greatly capture the essense of any particular age . The economy design is a stripped down version of Age of Empires , and it remains the same throughout every age . This game will be fun for kids , but the build build , build , attack , attack , attack game has gotten really old with me.My rating may be biased because I prefer turn based strategy games . I just found this game to be kinda boring .	-1
'Empire Earth ' is n't the EASIEST game to learn . It actually has a high learning curve . And it does n't look that GREAT . But there 's something about it . All these different epochs you can play in . It is worth checking out now if you can find it in a bargain bin .	-1
Perhaps I 'm just not enough of & quot ; hard core & quot ; gamer , but I foudn this game too difficult to be enjoyable . While I enjoyed building and advancing my civilization , there 's just no way to avoid doing battle and play a simply economic game . So , about the time I get a wonder built or a couple started the AI kicks in and stomps the bejeezus out of me . I 've had the game for a year - even bought the strategy guide - and I 've yet to play complete a scenario succesfully , and this is while playing on the easiest setting . Perhaps I 'm more used to simulation/city-building games than RTS games , but it seems to me that for the game to be enjoyable the average use ought to have at least a reasonable chance at success.Technically , graphically , it 's a great game . No complaints there , but the level of difficulty makes me unlikely to want to continue playing .	-1
A great way to waste [ ... ] , or how about [ ... ] . This game has little to no graphics , gameplay is nothing anyone should want , it lags all the time , even in story ( hows that supposed to work , do n't ask me ) , and the only good thing about it is that you can outfit your character.Cons : Almost EverythingPros : The Outfitter	-1
This game actually came to me cracked , so i had my money refunded . Stuff happens sometimes . It has good games on it , but where 's the Sega genesis classic Pac Man adventures game ? Does anyone remember that game besides me ? We 'd like to play that again .	-1
This might have been a great game : if it had been released about six years ago . This game is a Myst clone that came out about five years too late . `` Clone '' is a bit too much of a compliment . ... is a slightly better phrase , because this game falls short of the excellent series that it aspires to be.The graphics for the game are simply awful . The screen looks like a drenched comic book that just got pulled out of the gutter . Perhaps it is because the game is fixed at 640X480 resolution when most computers can go way higher . It looks like some effort was put into the artwork for the game , but it is spoiled by the smeared-out , grainy look that occupies every screen . `` Riven '' is much older and looks better . So does `` Grim Fandango '' . The voice acting is abominable , and so is the acting for the game 's in-game movies . I thought that we got rid of those years ago when everyone realized how cheesy they were.If the game had a good premise , then the poor production values would n't matter very much , but it does n't . It 's another `` abandoned world full of weird machines '' game . This time , it 's an alien world . A good puzzle game has to have puzzles that fit into the virtual world . Unfortunately , `` Schizm '' has lots of contrived puzzles that do n't make sense . Want to walk across a bridge ? Figure out how to push a series of 20 buttons in the right order . Do n't expect to just push one button . Apparently , aliens are extremely bored geniuses who have nothing better to do than build complicated contraptions that confuse Earthling scientists . I wonder if aliens have to push a series of color-coded buttons in a special order to operate a toothbrush.I 'll give the game props for having good music and , yes , the puzzles are very difficult . If you are up for a challenge , they will definitely do that . It 's hard to get interested in them though , since the game always constrains you along a tight path instead of letting you explore a 3D world . That 's another big fault that this game has when you compare it to other adventure games . Here 's a tip : skip this one unless you have played all other adventure games that you want to play first . I played `` Myst '' , `` Riven '' , `` Sanitarium '' , and the `` Syberia '' demo , and they are all better than `` Schizm '' .	-1
This is an absolutely horrible game . The first thing you notice , though fairly trivial , is that the graphics are bad . There 's no changing the resolution or the color depth , so it runs at what appears to be 640x480 or something with a very low color depth . Everything 's grainy with banding due to lack of color.The next biggest problem is that the navigation is terrible . You move forward by clicking when you randomly pass the cursor over the right spot and the cursor turn to the right shape . But , to turn , you either have to use the cursor keys ( which do an instantaneous turn instead of a pan , so it 's hard to hold an image in your head of where you are ) , or you click and PUSH the mouse in the direction you want to turn instead of clicking and dragging the window in that direction ( and the pan is so fast you ca n't see the scenery go by ) . There 's no cursor change in those cases . Then , if you can look up or down , the only indication you have is a change to an icon down below the scene in your inventory . Plus , the cursor shape indicating a possible path is very easy to confuse as to where it 's really pointing . In some cases , clicking forward will turn you 45 degrees before proceeding to take you somewhere nowhere near where it looked like it would take you . In other cases , you think it 's pointing somewhere you 've been , but it 's not ( so you miss a path ) . You end up watching the cursor and thinking about the mechanics of movement instead of looking at the scenery and tying to figure out what 's going on . Also irritating is that once you click to go forward , it will stop at multiple , non-significant spots ( even on straight , non-divertable paths ) . So , you spend time sweeping the cursor over everything in every direction wondering what 's so important that the game stopped you here.But , the biggest problem is the puzzles themselves . The charitable description would be that they 're impossibly hard . A more accurate description is that there 's neither rhyme nor reason to them . In some cases , there 's no indication that a device IS a puzzle and not just a static display . If you do n't have a necessary inventory item , you ca n't do anything and there 's no indication that you could EVER do anything in it . If you have some random inventory item that it expects , it just changes the cursor in the right place ( if you happen to cross the spot ) and you drop it on . In others , the puzzle is so vague that you 're not even sure what you 're supposed to be doing with it or why . Then you have to work your way through multiple , non-easily-written notation systems or phonetics . In my case , I uninstalled the game when it became obvious that it wanted me to reproduce some long string of barely heard , non-phonetically-writeable , background-noise-filled , alien speech on a set of devices strewn in four or six places about a very large room.Impossible . Not fun in the least . Do NOT , under any circumstances , buy this game .	-1
If Einstein is on you cellphone 's & quot ; friend & quot ; list , then you will have fun with this game . & quot ; Schizm & quot ; has a & quot ; I think I heard this one before & quot ; story plot . Alas ! I do recall . Remember & quot ; Aliens & quot ; , the movie , where the colony is mysteriously empty ... The one where we send people to look for them , and they disappear too ? So what do we do ? SEND MORE ! Yup , except for the excitement of aliens , you basically have the premise of & quot ; Schizm 's & quot ; storyline . An empty planet-nobody around . & quot ; Schizm & quot ; IS beautiful . Remember when & quot ; Myst & quot ; came out and following it 's success , every company released their own version of the game ? Well , this is the latest . At least in & quot ; Myst 's & quot ; defense , the puzzzles were well-thought through , made sense , and you got that great feeling in your tummy when you solved a major task . Forget it with this game . Only original concept : You actually play with two players..each landed at a different destination in the beginning storyline . You can switch back and forth between them . In order to solve many of the puzzles , you have to use the knowledge between the two players to complete each puzzle . If you are armed with a degree in Math and Engineering , you will work your way to the lousy ending . Not so fortunate ? Join the other 90 percent of Schizm 's players who admit they needed a walkthrough or a website with hints . Pass on this , unless you feel good about yourself incessantly cheating and feeling no reward for accomplishing a difficult game . I promise , there are better ones out there . A great anonymous quote I read online : & quot ; After playing this game , even the word & quot ; Schizm & quot ; gave me irritable goosebumps. & quot ; To be fair , if I could , I would give it 2 1/2stars . I know there are people out there who love the ultimate challenge ... If you are one of those people who never gets bored with impossible , countless , and meaningless puzzles ... this could be the one for you .	-1
Wow . The title of the review is pretty much the sum of the parts . Excessive-compulsive cd swapping . Two characters so you can play the same game twice . Puzzles that you simply did n't know existed . `` Einstein could n't solve the puzzles on Schizm '' , the quote is true . But what the previous reviewer failed to point out is ... ... ..why would Einstein even bother ? Schizm is lacking in so many areas that adventure games are expected to have , it is a shock that I continued to play this game for the sheer beauty of the lands.However shocking it may be , Schizm starts off suprisingly strong . The puzzles are difficult , but fair . You 'll be pleasently suprised if you choose to play the first two lands . All I saw was a four star rating from this point in time.But then ... ... the game continues . And as it continues the game proceeds to lack a plot , an experience , and a grip of logic.The puzzles fail at this point because the player is always lead to believe he or she is doing something entirely different than what is intended . And there will be no hints ... ... .One puzzle involves changing a scattered code of Arglirian numbers into a different set . Never does this game even hint to the fact that this code is not an access key . Looking at the strategy guide I can tell you I was appalled to see the steps I would have to take in order to continue.And have a geometry/calculus book handy as well . Does the game give you hints to lead you on the geometric triangle puzzle ? I think not.Last but not least , there are double character puzzles . This means you must traverse the same grounds to get to the same location with both characters . And they have to go all the way back . And then one of the characters will have to go to the other side of THAT land , and so forth ... . I was in shock the game creators actually thought this COULD be fun.All that negativity being shed , however , I liked the puzzles in Schizm ( the first two lands ) . They were made for the experienced adventure gamer and any adult can appreciate that , as games like Syberia and the Longest Journey hold your hand all the way through the game.But frankly , an adventure game can not be fueled without a good plot , and the only chance you 'll get at that will be the end ... ... . ( the best part of the game ... ..it is SO CHEESY ) . I had no desire to wrap up the puzzles , and that 's a shame , because I 'm sure this company is well aware Prima Strategy guides are upwards 20 dollars.Two stars says you should just steer clear . This game turns into a chore , and steals any chance of redemption .	-1
Schizm is a beautiful game , but not without its problems . First of all , its navigation is cumbersome . Unlike other adventuregames of today , it does not allow 360 degrees movement , wich is a bit of a let down . The movement by mouse is tricky , and often irritating - you ca n't stop the movement in time . Freezing is frequent , saving every two minutes imperative . The storyline reminds ( to say the least ) a lot of other games in this genre , especially The Journeyman Project 3 , by Presto . I would say , it 's almost identical . And then there 's the graphics , wich , at least on cd-rom , are not quite the quality I 've come to expect , having played Exile and Riven . The puzzles defy logic . I would say the 're undoable without hints , nudges and pushes , or even een detailed walkthrough in times . That said , Schizm has a beautiful atmosphere , great music and superb sounds . The different worlds are stunning , although , again , a lot has been borrowed if not copied from either Riven/Exile or real life ( Gaudi 's architecture , for example . ) Is it worth the money ? Yes , well , maybe . But be ready for some major irritations and resorting to walkthroughs .	-1
I bought this game from the `` bargain bin '' not realizing that there was a DVD version of the game - in the long run it probably would not have made a difference . With the CD-ROM details are fuzzy . I 'm sure this game is beautiful with the DVD version since there are some spectacular colors even on the CD-ROM . In any case , this does not take away from the fact that I loathed this game.In Schizm there are two characters - Sam and Hannah . At times you play Sam , other times Hannah . One of the difficulties is knowing who to play when . As we all know , there is a lot of running around in adventure games . That 's just the nature of the genre and true to form , there 's a lot of back and forth to various locations . That 's OK but sometimes you have to do this with both characters - the exact same locations , essentially repeating all that running around . But that was n't what did me in.What did me in were the puzzles . I 'm not big on puzzles that do n't seem to have any relation to the story . In other words , finding clues , putting them together and solving the puzzle . No - some of these were random puzzles . Just keep on plugging in numbers over and over again until you come up with the right combination . The puzzle that truly tried my sanity was a maze-type puzzle - basically finding a route from one place to another while the game blocks your moves eventually cutting you off from reaching the end . The puzzle is random so it 's a new route everytime . It 's not as easy as it sounds . I probably attempted this puzzle 30-40 times until I got it right . But guess what ... you do n't have to do this one time , but twice and you have to get it right two times in a row . One walkthrough ( I had to use three different ones ) stated that if you kept track of your moves on the first successful attempt all you had to do was repeat the results on the second try - nope . Oh but guess what ? ? ? Once you are successful with this puzzle , you get to go to another location and do the exact same puzzle again . Sorry - not me . That 's when I quit . I was able to finished 3/4 of this horrible game but I just could n't go on.I would only recommend this game if you are some kind of masochist .	-1
I have been waiting months for this game to come out , and the day the local software store got it in I rushed out and bought it right away . I was so excited , I could n't WAIT to play ! Thank god this store has a great return policy on open software.I am a HUGE fan of High Heat , but this year took a step backwards . The graphics , while improved in some aspects and worsened in others are alright . The animations seem too fast , I liked the & quot ; tight & quot ; feel of 2001 . I also do n't like the new blue stat/score boxes in-game . They look blocky and the font is bad.The sound has really not improved . All of the sounds from 2001 have been carried over to 2002 with the exception of new announcer voices . The Main Menu and Options screens now have varying musical themes following a rock/techno theme , what they have to do with baseball is beyond me.My main problem is the differences with the difficulty settings . If you play on & quot ; Rookie & quot ; level you are pretty much going to win no matter what . Bump it up to & quot ; Triple A & quot ; and it 's pretty much the same ( I have had 10-16 run innings many times , I even won a game 46-0 ) . So go up one more notch to & quot ; Pro & quot ; and all of the sudden the computer is pitching one-hitters and nailing every pitch you throw to him no matter how much you switch it up . And what 's even more bothersome is that there is 2 more difficulty levels above that ! Better balance with the levels would have been a nice touch.More minor problems include your baserunners with a mind of their own even when you specifically state in the options that you want full control . Announcers saying things at the wrong times or audio being cut off half way through their sentence . I even had the game dump to my desktop right as I hit a game winning homerun before.I 'm not saying that this game is absolutely terrible , I just do n't think it was an improvement over 2001 which I belive is one of the best games I have ever played . High Heat 2001 never made me pound on my keyboard or swear at my monitor in frustration ... .every single game of 2002 did . *Word of note for anyone who is having a problem with their graphics when a ball is hit into the outfiled . There is a box in the & quot ; Preferences & quot ; screen right underneath your Video Card selction with a check mark in it . You need to un-check it every time you go into the Preferences screen because for some reason it likes to automatically re-check itself every time you enter Preferences .	-1
I love strategy games.I still play CIV2 , Master of Orion2 , CTP2.And remember others fondly.This is n't one of them.This one is just a lame game.It 's slow . Game play is close to non-existent.conquest is not fun , but tedious.Marching a group of your soldiers from one of your towns to another and a significant percentage of them will die.Same with sailing your ships . If you had 3 ships and sailed them from England to Germany , how many would you reasonably expect to make this short voyage ? How many if you controlled all the coastal regions in northern europe ? If you think all your ships should typically manage to sail for an entire day without sinking , your vision does not agree with this game.As I said , it 's a very lame game.Save your money for CIV3 or Arcanum .	-1
EU is heartbreakingly close to being one of the best computer games ever produced . Economics , religion , warfare , diplomacy , and exploration have never been so successfully integrated . As several people have pointed out , however , the manual and tutorial are woefully inadequate for such a complex game . You 'll find yourself learning this game largely by blind trial and error . But I could live with that , given this game 's many other terrific features . The thing that destroyed my interest in EU is the fact that this game cheats OUTRAGEOUSLY in combat . It is not uncommon to lose battles even when you outnumber the AI 's forces by 10:1 or more . You can spend game-decades building up your armies and planning campaigns , only to watch your entire empire 's armed forces get brutalized by inferior numbers of inferior troops . As long as you never fight another major power you 're fine , but should you become involved in a war with another power , expect to do a lot of save-and-restore-ing to counter-act the senseless combat resolution . In my opinion , the game is not playable in its current state .	-1
This one of the worst games I have purchased for my computer . ( I have well over 500 . ) 1 . The tutorial is worthless . It tells you to perform a certain function , but it does n't tell you how to do it or why to do it . 2 . The manual , although chock full of information , is terrible . I guess it would be OK if you are using it as resource material for a Masters Thesis in History . All in all I have to say I 've wasted my $ 40 , but hey , it 'll make a nice coaster for my beer glass .	-1
This game has so much potential , but it is filled with fatal bugs and no patches have yet been announced to fix them . It constantly seizes and freezes , forcing you to reboot your whole system each time so saving often is key . However , in one hour of gaming , it froze 5 times on me , making it hardly an enjoyable experience . It is a shame that it does this , for it looks like it will be better than AOK . Nevertheless , the constant reboots are infuriating and will make me question ever buying a game from this company until I see the patches are out.For those who wonder ... I have a 700 Mhz Athlon with the latest 3dFX and 128 Mgs of ram . It is less than year old and is able to easily handle such games as Baldur 's Gate II , Deus Ex and Mech Warrior 4 . Hence , I can only blame the game .	-1
When I first got this game I thought it would be just like a pre-colonial version of Age of Empires 2 . One brutal defeat after another told me one thing : that this game was not nearly as good as AOE2 . I consider myself a very good AOE player , ( I can beat 4 hard enemys in less than 2 hours ) but this is simply an hard . The main reason is that it 's simply unrealistic . I build a whole army of soldiers and they get gunned down before they get half way to the enemy town . At the beginning this game can be fun building and gathering . Some of the missions are good also ( including combat ones . ) But like another reviewer said , & quot ; This is n't strategy it 's a race. & quot ; And I could n't agree more .	-1
I 've played and liked ( and usually loved ) every Sid Meier game.This one is not on the same page as CIV , etc.poor graphicspoor balanceabsolutely horrid game playThis is one annoying stinker.This is one of the rare games that makes me wish that I could return software .	-1
After the excellent Command & amp ; Conquer , I 'd hoped Westwood would come out with something just as good as the original . As usual , I was wrong . While the story and FMVs are as good as ever , and there are plenty of units to choose from ( including welcome sea and air units ) . There 's just one problem to the game : IT 'S A TANK RUSH . Prepare to test your & quot ; strategy & quot ; by seeing who can get more resources to fund medium tank production , because nothing else is worth building for the first 20 minutes . Unless you and your buddy are at the same skill level or you 're playing a premade mission where the computer starts out with enough defenses to trash basic tanks , all you 'll see is hordes and hordes of them . If you 're not going to play this online and just want to try out cool missions , go ahead and buy Red Alert . Otherwise , get something worthwhile like Total Annihilation .	-1
And I do n't mean it on a `` mature content present '' way . Actually quite the oppposite . This is a game aimed towards children , I would say younger than 15 . Not a very good or entertaining game for anyone older . The PSP Camera on itself is very good quality , but the game is simply shallow . I came here expecting a good Pokemon ripoff , and leave dissapointed . There 's a lot of wasted potential on Invizimals.I would suggest against purchasing it , the PSP games that are a lot better than this . I only give it 2 stars because it comes with the camera , otherwise it would be 1 star for sure .	-1
The only reason I play this game is because it 's pretty addictive ; however , it has many flaws : The music is extremely annoying , the sound effects are n't at all notable , you hardly get any points for clearing viruses , you get no points for just matching 4 regular pieces , and the graphics on this game are no different from the regular Nintendo . Come on ; this is supposed to be a newer and better game system ! They made Super Mario 64 look a lot different and better from the original , so why could n't they have improved this game ?	-1
This game is Exactly like Tetris ! So do n't get this game .	-1
What a shame ! I had high hopes for PGA 2001 . Unfortunately , EA spent a lot of time ( and money ) motion capturing Tiger and not enough time re-creating courses . Surely , something with the potential that the PS2 has could have handled more than 3 courses , at the very least give me some variety . TPC at Sawgrass anyone ? I really did like the use of the analog sticks to swing , that 's one of the nice aspects of this game . However , I expected a lot more depth from the company that released Madden 2001 , no season , no stats , no MONEY ? It 's ironic that the much-maligned & quot ; Swing Away Golf & quot ; has more detail & amp ; depth than a PGA licensed product . Rent it , or buy mine when I take it to the used video game store .	-1
three hours after i bought this game i had beaten every stage . i like to focus on the positive , so i will say the colors and graphics , though cartoonish , are eyecatching . other than that its not much more positive about it . i believe if it cost maybe $ 15 or less , i would feel better about it . i believe if you spend $ 40 on this , when you play it you are going to be upset . unless you have 40 bucks to throw away . nice simple fighting game , yes . worth 40 dollars , not even close .	-1
Lets be honest here , I have been playing fighting games since Street Fighter was released in the arcades , and I am talking about the first one in the mid 1980s . Then of course the titanic Street Fighter 2 came out and changed the face of fighting games forever in around 1991 . Well anyways it introduced a system of special moves that required fancy joystick movements and a series of button presses to pull off . The fighting genre was nothing but punches and kicks until SF2 came out . Well after the success of SF2 CAPCOM made Darkstalkers ( Vampire Savior in Japan ) , which fused those special moves with over the top monsters from hollywood films like the wolfman , mummy , etc . with that special CAPCOM styling . It is an awesome series and in some ways I like it much better than SF2 . But herein lies the problem with the PSP treatment , as much as I try to love this game for the rare gem it is , I ca n't . The control system was not tweeked enough back at CAPCOM to make it function properly with the PSP digital pad ( directional pad ) , and thus we are left with essentially a button mashing mess . I am sure some will be unable to see past this flaw but when you are talking abut taking out the very foundation of a game series , in this case special moves , then you are left with a shell of what could have been the best 2D fighter ever released on a handheld system . It pains me to say that but it is true and I think if your honest with yourself you will appreciate that I hate it that this game did n't turn out well because of something so fundamental . CAPCOM please be wary next time !	-1
I think I bought this purely out of some nostalgic sense of duty , as the professional review I 'd read of it was unflattering . I should have listened to the pros on this one . This game presents nothing new to anyone who 's played a Darkstalkers game in the past , the graphics definitely do n't come close to other titles available for the PSP ( which tells me the developers do n't even care about this product ) , and some of the button combos that you are required to punch through are near impossible to accomplish . All in all , the only challenge I got from playing this game was to get the characters to do their more advanced moves , but even without them I could still win through and beat the game . Total waste of hard earned money .	-1
I do n't like Frogger . Never have . This version was received to me as a Christmas gift ( gee , I seem to say that in EVERY one of my reviews ! ) and I hate how difficult it is . Yes , the difficulty lies in maneuvering , but it 's *really* hard . Even the very first level ( the street level ) is pretty tough . Finally reaching and failing the cloud level ( over and over again ) is when I finally said `` no more ! '' and pulled the game from the computer . This was 5 years ago and I 'm still happy about the decision .	-1
if you like a simple game of monopoly then you would probably like this to me the graphic looked old and i just like the newer stuff like here and now monopoly for pc its like a newer generation design	-1
I 'm good at puzzle games and I like them . But this is too hard . Getting 1 sword will be hard for beginners or any gamers . You must have to have the Stragety Guide memorized in your brain to beat this . You should not ever get a Zelda game ( unless you 're up for the challenge ) . Do n't get this .	-1
Castlevania is an impossibly-hard , overrated classic NES game . I admit , I never played it back then in the 80 's because it did n't seem to be all that interesting . I pick the game up tonight and manage to beat it . No joke . I 've beaten Contra ( without losing a life ) , Mission : Impossible , Bart Simpson vs. Space Mutants , Mighty Bomb Jack , Friday the 13th , etc . without using the game genie . Back to Castlevania , it 's a pretty boring game that relies a lot mostly on memorization and sheer luck . It 's a repeat of everything that I 've messed up and tried to correct my mistakes before I can progress further . Overall , my time is greatly wasted overall after I manage to finish the Dracula off , not once but twice . Damn ... too long . The finish is n't worth my frustration . The sheer difficulty of the game is pretty incredible and needless . It does n't help matters any if the controls are absolutely s****y as hell . There is no password after a completion of each level , which makes the fun of the game practically non-existent.By the way , the Grim Reaper is a joke of a challenge . Basically , go to the left block in the middle . Then , two seconds later , go to the 2nd block to the right . Wait until the sickles start to appear . Move to the leftmost block , and start firing boomerangs as many as you can . When you get knocked off the ledge , wait until the very last boomerang makes a full round trip to eliminate whatever sickles are there left . Then , get back to the ledge , and keep throwing more boomerangs . Eventually , the match will be over as long as you are nimble enough to spot the easy escapes by moving to the right a bit and then coming back to the left . Sometimes , the Grim Reaper will jump upon you which is one of the five or six random patterns offered in this particular battle . When that happens , move immediately to the rightmost block , and copy the same strategy as if you are on the leftmost block . A bit over time , you can start moving back to the leftmost block to finish the Grim Reaper off .	-1
I got this for my collection of NES & SNES games , but this is awful ! The graphics are terrible ( yes , I know this is 1980 NES game ) , Simon has no face . The first few stages were fun , until I got to the first boss : An ugly bat who was impossible to attack with your whip . After a week of practice , I defeated it and moved on to part # 2 . This is where the bad controls start to ruin it . Every time an enemy hit me , Simon would bounce backwards to his doom . I gave up after that .	-1
This game is the worst of the three . Messy , aweful games , and same characters . DO N'T BUY !	-1
I 'm a racing fan , and star wars fan , so i rented this . I did not like it , but i played it a few years ago so i have no memories on this game . I do remember that the levels were filled with junk and the sense of speed was fast , so all you did was hit stuff . I did not like it .	-1
Luckily , I rented this before deciding whether or not to buy . And boy am I lucky that I tried it before dropping $ 50 for it.Well , everyone knows about the concept and cool graphics and all . The game suffered no slow down even with multi-tap on . But after playing for a short time , I realized how bad this game is . The controls are difficult , the power-ups are useless in a race ( you need to use shortcuts to win ) . And worse , the carts move way too slow . The fun of any cart racing ( ala Mario Kart or even Rumble Racing ) is that it 's fast . This game felt like I was moving at snail pace.I wish that they would put Mario Kart on PS2 ( though never happen ) or someone come up with a true kart game . The closest out right now is Rumble Racing which is definitely worth the look if you 're looking for cart racing type game .	-1
Super Mario Kart tended to dominate the N64 as the best multiplayer game . So I 've been waiting and watching the kart racing games for the PS2 hoping to find one that will give the same level of fun . Unfortunately , Super Bombad Racer falls short.Remember that kart-racing games are suppose to be fun and childish , so the cartoonish characters with large heads and silly taunts are up the right alley . The large number of special items ( forward weapons , backward weapons , boosts , shields , etc . ) adds a good level of playability to the game , unfortunately with a bunch of racers everyone is shooting everyone all the time and there 's no real strategy involved.The controls for the game are also very loose . It takes a lot of getting used to as you bounce all over the place and ca n't make the tight turns you 'd like to . The levels are relatively simple and there 's not a lot you can do to improve your racing ability on them.You 'll probably play through all 9 nine of the levels in about an hour and then wonder what you 're suppose to do . The game quickly looses its enjoyment in single player mode . Luckily there 's multi-player mode to come to the rescue and this game is good fun with a bunch of people . Still , I 've found after running through the levels a couple times with friends , there 's just not a lot of joy to it.Even battle mode has issues . With so many hit-you-from-across-the-screen-automatically weapons there is n't much skill required . You just need to know where on the level the good weapons can be found and hope your opponents do n't . And on some levels , Yoda-who can damage everyone with his special item-can just sit out of the way and slowly take everyone out.Overall , this is a fun game for a little while , but is likely to sit on your shelf except when you have friends over . It 's probably better to save your money and wait for that great kart-racing game to come out for the PS2 .	-1
This is by far THE worst game I have ever played on any system . I do n't see how anyone could think this game is fun . The graphics are not good , the map would be better off not even there , and the glitches in the game should not even be an issue ... but they are , besides the fact that the game freezes up , running into objects is annoying enough to make you want to snap your controller in half . Please do n't anyone buy this game , and hope that they do n't try to waste anyone 's time with a sequel .	-1
This is a game that will have a huge following with some gamers , but most with hate it just for it 's genre and not give it a chance . There are many great things about this game , but to me there are just too many bad things.In the good catagory monkey island has great graphics . To me it kinda looks like toy story or such . Cool cgi animation . There is a lot of humor as you control the sometimes very ignorant hero on his many adventure ( or complacated trips for his wife ) . There is also a TON of exploring to do and at every turn there is another puzzle to keep the story moving , and to me this is one of the main problems with this game.The puzzles are sometimes things you would never think of . Some of his escapes from various traps etc . are very much like mcgyver , and took me a long time to piece them together , but that may just be me . For most people including me a guide may be a needed , not option thing . I 'm far from stupid but some of the puzzles just are n't at all obvious . The controls at times can also be a problem , it takes alot of time to move around many areas and can be a real pain running back and forth . The almost constant loading times are also a problem , whenever dialogue is going on the game is jerky , same with movies , and sometimes the smallest little scene needs a load time.To me this game shows why this genre of games will never be as popular as the gran turismo 's and resident evils . If you have alot of patience and a lot of time this game may be for you , but for me i 'll stick to gt 3 for now . At least rent before you buy .	-1
One of the first things you do when you begin serious development of a general-market software product : consider the system configurations that it could work with and make it compatible with as many of those as possible without sacrificing tons of features.That is n't how Microsoft did things though when creating the Train Simulator software.This product just wo n't run on my relatively new PC -- which was designed for high performance gaming . Even after repeated attempts to work with Microsoft Support , no luck.And after hearing and reading several other users ' difficulties , I 'm convinced that Microsoft made some basic mistakes on the development of this product.Despite their claims to have designed this for a wider audience than the hardcore gamer , Microsoft has released a product that does require more configuration twiddling than should be performed when installing a PC game.And purchase of a new video or sound card should n't be a requirement for getting a product like this to work either.It is a shame too . Because this simulator seems to have so much to offer.I was really hoping to have hours of fun with this ... but I 'll have to wait for a more robust product from someone else .	-1
Do n't get me wrong I love trains , but I think that this game is just terrible . The graphics are merely ok , nothing amazing . Microsoft in my opinion tried to make this game way to realistic , where it goes beyond fun and becomes a job . Also TS gets so boring and dull after about 20-30 minutes that you will most likely wish to return it . Overal , the game in MY OPINION is a disaster , but if you are a HARD CORE SIM FAN maybe you will enjoy MTS .	-1
As a huge fan of Microsoft software , I regret to say this is the lowest quality ever sold by them . Microsoft even skimped on the software packaging . Just a cheap CD envelope and brochure type key card . The software has a somewhat unfinished feel to it . The scenery and models are extremely simple and plain . I attempted 2 installations with this software , and my computer has not been the same since . I strongly urge anyone to wait for a few versions to come before paying for Train Simulator . If this were any item other than software , it would go right back to the store to be returned . For Microsoft , Shame on you ! I am now a skeptical Microsoft buyer . -Long Live Quality !	-1
I picked this game up because it was cheap and happened to be one of the few adventure games I did n't already own . It was a waste money . This most awful computer game I 've ever played . The storyline is boring and confusing and the graphics and voice acting are terrible . It 's an excruciatingly slow game to get through , not because it 's hard , but because it takes forever to get from point A to point B and then you have to listen to some awful dialogue for a while . The puzzle I had the most problem with in the game was the one where you had to light torches in a dark tunnel . You ca n't go on to the next stretch of tunnel until you light the torch in that area , and it 's impossible to see anything . I was reduced to searching the screen with my cursor until I could find a spot where the game would allow me to use my matches . It was n't hard to figure out what I had to do , but actually doing it was another matter . Save youself the frusteration and boredom and buy some other game . Whatever else you might get , it 'll probably be better than this game . If it 's worse , you have my sympathy .	-1
This game was enjoyable for the first two hours and then its fun factor quickly went down hill . It is far too complicated to figure out the right combination of car , color , license plate , etc that is needed to race the different groups . For Japanese street racing geeks that is probably their idea of great fun , but it 's not mine . I regret buying this game .	-1
The first arcade version of Crazy Taxi , with its instantly recognizable music and appearance , was an amazingly popular game . Its concept was simple yet irresistible -- to create a driving game where you do n't have to worry about crashes , and where your goal shifts all the time so that it 's the equivalent of 30 , 40 racing courses . I was a devotee of this game and had spent hours on it.This PlayStation 2 version lost most of the magic in the translation . For one thing , inevitably , the controls are just not the same without the steering wheel , pedals , and the all-important gear shift , without which ( and without knowing the & quot ; boost & quot ; move ) you could never hope to pick up more than five , six passengers before your time runs out . The PS2 version , grievously , sped up the game clock so much that the game just blitzes by . It took me a long time to figure out how fast you have to execute the boost to make it work , and even then , finesse of control flew right out the window . So the game became what it always threatened to become , a frantic , overly speedy experience fit to give you a heart attack , so fast that there 's very little fun factor , just rushing to meet all the times without getting to enjoy anything.So many games these days are about & quot ; beating the clock & quot ; , probably reflective of our ADD-infested culture . Street Fighter became another flashy , graphics-ridden button masher ; Syphon Filter now forces you to run through levels ignoring enemies just to meet their insane & quot ; par times & quot ; , and Crazy Taxi requires the reflexes of a cockroach . Maybe I 'm from an older game culture where you do n't have to be on speed to compete . At any rate , this game was a sore disappointment . But I know I 'll jump onto the next classic Crazy Taxi on my next trip to the arcades and hope it 's still there .	-1
Again , another failed attempt at a racing game . Crazy Taxi gets boring really quickly and then you really have no where else to go and you end up bringing this one to your local Funcoland or Game Stop and trade it in for something else.The graphics are excellent and for the 5 minutes that it lasts , the game is fun but as soon as that 5 minutes is up , I would n't count on anything else to expect in this game.When will they come out with a racing game similar to Road Rash ? Atleast in Road Rash , there 's a lot more competition and you actually have to deal with the elements and environment around you . I can recall several times where I just drove across a park to get where I needed to go . Again , not very fun and an unfortunate thumbs down .	-1
You people rating this game 4 or 5 starts would n't know a good game if somebody slapped you in the face with it . This game is a disgrace , they should have kept it on the almost-extinct Dreamcast .	-1
I 'd idolized Crazy Taxi in its arcade form , so when I saw several copies available at the video store , I greedily nabbed one for myself . Ultimately , this is the sad story of a game with HUGE potential but a mediocre payoff.It 's a visually interesting and fast-paced driving game with great physics and entertaining extras ( passenger and driver comments can be quite funny ) , but there 's no point after about a half-hour . After you 've made 50 trips to the heli-port , the ball park , the church , and the KFC , you just ca n't take that stretch of road anymore . If you 're not interested in getting tips or scoring points ( which is mostly pointless anyway , since there are no additional levels to advance to ) , you can drive anywhere in the town , which includes in some cases to the tops of buildings and through parking garages . The `` go anywhere '' option is fun , but after you 've explored the last of the long , looping train track tunnels , however , there just is n't much more to do . Glad my wife 's got the Rent-Before-You-Buy rule.If you loved the arcade , it 's worth a rental , if only to get it out of your system . Imagine what Crazy Taxi could have been if you had the potential to advance your character , say , by starting out in Omaha and working your way up through Chicago to New York City ! Maybe they 'll add that for Crazy Taxi 8 ( or so ) . Though the graphics are n't as flashy as Crazy Taxi , I highly recommend `` The Simpsons : Road Rage '' as an alternative . It 's a game with a nearly identical concept but has a much higher replay value .	-1
There is absolutly no point to this game . I wasted three bucks from renting down at my local video store when i was bored one after noon . This game is the same thing over and over and over again . And theres no point to playing because you cant open anything , its already all open . So save your money and go buy a good game for the same price like Final Fantasy X .	-1
This game is a good bet for kids under the age of 14 , and it is a good fast-paced scramble for passengers and money . The annoying bits are that there is no damage to your taxi when you hit `` solid '' objects , you can not mow people down on the street , the missions are all timed , the street surface glitch is EXTREMELY annoying ( sometimes the street will completely disappear , looking like glass ) , and the wannabee Wolfman Jack should look for another means of employment . The side missions , exp . the long jump , [ are ] REALLY [ bad ] .	-1
Now I myself personally love me some Super Mario . If you checked my reviews , you 'll see that I 've givenSuper Mario Advance 4 : Super Mario Bros 3 & Super Mario World : Super Mario Advanceall high ratings . When I purchased those two games , I 've noticed that Nintendo made some changes with those games since the last time I 've owned them on Super Nintendo . So here I am with Super Mario Advance , which is Super Mario 2 on Game Boy Advance , and I have to say that I 've not impressed at all with this one . I understand that video games `` evolve '' over time and creaters try to make them better , but there is a difference between making the game better than the origonal , and making it complicated than the origonal . Nintendo did the latter with this game.Changes for the good are nice for me . On this one you can pick you character each time you die ( actually you could do that since theSuper Mario All-Starsgame , and I did n't know you could n't do that on the origonal NES game until I was playing my cousin 's Wii a few days ago ) . Also it tells you each characters power under them on the select screen . Another helpful change is when you collect the star which makes you become invincible for a few seconds . Back then when you collect a certain amount of cherries , a star would just randomly float from the bottom of the screen . On here you 'll hear some kind of tone which warns you the star is comming.Not so good changes are very visible . First of all , what got me was during the beginning of the game , there is a long drop before you reach the bottom and start . They changed that too , which sucks . Also on the origonal game you started off big ( the status you are when you have at least two hearts on the left side of the screen ) . Here you 're small ( with one heart on the left side ) , which really is n't a problem because you can find hearts anywhere to make you grow . Back then if you kill enough enemies , a heart will float from the ground and you gain more life . Here , hearts are inside the plants you pick up from the ground and sitting idle in high places on levels . And what really ticks me off is the red shell that you can pick up from the ground . Back then you threw the red shell at an enemie and it would have hit the wall and dissapeared . Here if you throw a shell , it will bounce off the wall and keep going , and if it hits you , you loose a heart or die ( come on now ! ) . And whats the deal with those huge Shy Guys and Turnip Plants ? And like every Mario game , the characters speak ( Peach does n't know when to shut up ) . Hell even Birdo speaks ( that purple dinosaur that shoot out eggs ) , and half the time I do n't even knows what she is saying.There you have it with Super Mario 2 on Game Boy Advance . What I believed happened was that Nintendo received feedback since 1993 when this game was reissued on SNES on how difficult the game was and tried their best to make it easier and more fun for new and younger Nintendo gamers , because I played the origonal on the Wii and it was the exact version on the NES and it was way harder . Older guys like me will definately find this game flawed if you 've had it in different formats . Nintendo has made some great reissues with great modifications , but they shot a brick with this one big time . Peace.P.S.- The Arcade game appears on all Super Mario Advance games .	-1
This game is the pits ! Its the worst Mario game ever . Even worse than Mario 64.Pros : Nice GraphicsCons : Makes you madder than the Mad Hatter ! Terrible GameplayToo hard	-1
This game is a big disappointment from Nintendo . First off , the original game was n't all that great to begin with due to its tiny worlds , nonexistant powerups , and simple boss characters . However , what makes this game a real loser is that it 's worse than the the SNES remake on the Super Mario All-Stars game and even the original NES game ! The game does have some advantages over previous versions:1 ) The graphics are taken from Super Mario All-Stars and therefore are an improvement over the original.2 ) The mindnumbingly boring slot machine scene after each tiny world have been made more tolerable since you can now bet a group of coins instead of making individual bets for each and every coin you have.3 ) Like All-Stars , you can pick a different character after each tiny level instead of waiting until an entire world was cleared.What makes this game worse than All-Stars ? 1 ) The horrible scrolling engine ! SMB2 had a unique scrolling style on vertical levels which remains , but the horizontal levels are torture too . You can literally tap your character one direction or the other and the entire screen will scroll so that your character is near either the left or right edge . The scrolling engine alone makes this game unplayable . What is it with Nintendo and its policy of using lousy camera work for its Mario games ? I thought that was just for their 3D Mario games.2 ) The annoying vocal work from the 3D games has been added here to make the experience as unpleasant as possible . Do we really need to hear `` Lucky '' after collecting a cherry ? Battle scenes with Birdo have some sort of annoying speech that I have n't made out quite yet , and it freezes the action while the dialog is being spoken.3 ) Weird tacked-on stuff : the game has a lot of little new things that just feel totally out of place . Anyone familiar with the real version of the game is familiar with the inital drop that happens when you start world 1-1 . The new version is totally different and this new little vertical area is littered with everything that will annoy you about this game.My recommendation ? DO NOT BUY.Nintendo needs to know that terrible ports like this are totally unacceptable ! I recommend waiting for the Nintendo Revolution ( aka the poorly named `` Wii '' ) and obtain the NES original or the superior SNES Super Mario All-Stars version on the virtual console instead .	-1
Mario is known all over the world by his famous super jump which smashes enemies into the ground . Unfortunelty , this game has no super jumps . You have to throw vegetables to kill your enemies . This is the worst idea for a Mario game . The good thing is that you get to choose from four diffrent characters , Mario , Luigi , Peach , and Toad , and it includes the amazing Link It Up , which allows four players to play from the same gamepack ( Note : you will need the link cable ) .I just do n't like it because they killed the Mario classics . Buy it if you enjoy wasting your money ! ( in other words , do n't buy it )	-1
super mario advance 2 is better than this , at least it has the classic super mario world which is really awesome but this like balh . get the 2nd version . youll like it more than this .	-1
The original GBA is an eye-killer because its screen is so dark . Even though the LCD is active-matrix , you ca n't see much even under the best lighting conditions . Get the new SP edition instead ; it has built-in frontlight .	-1
I bought this a few years ago because I sold myGame Boy Advance SP Classic NES Limited Editionsince I bought aNintendo DS Lite Onyx Blackand later came across some of my old GB Color and Black and White games I thought I lost in a move . This is crap compared to aGame Boy Advance SP Classic NES Limited Editionsystem ( or any GBA SP ) . The screen is so dark on this original GBA System , I have to shine several lights on it to see the screen and sometimes the glare of the lights makes it even more difficult to see the screen . Just stick with a DS or an GBASP system to play GBA Games .	-1
There is absolutely NO POINT buying a GBA . Its the same thing as a Game Boy only the thing is shaped different . 32-bit ? . Do yourself a favor and dont buy this ... .	-1
This is the third official version of F-Zero . There are hacks claiming to be F-Zero 2 , but there are only three games in the series , F-Zero ( SNES ) , F-Zero X ( N64 ) , & F-Zero : Maximum Velocity ( GBA ) . F-Zero is a relatively simple concept ... it is all about a space race . Each vehicle is equipped with a jet propulsion system and magnetic stabilizers . You race down the tracks at speeds exceeding 600mph . Racers from all over the galaxy come to compete . Once you are on the track , anything goes . Other racers can even push you off the track and to your death.I was rather pleased with the feel of the game . The whirr of the engines was well done for this limited audio power on the GBA . Collision SFX did lack in the sense that they sounded more like someone sneezing . The cityscape presented on the earlier tracks was well preserved from the SNES version . The vehicles have a new take on appearance . These are nicely rendered in 3D when you select your machine , however in game racing uses a very dulled down version of the CG models featured in the vehicle select screen . The track does spin nicely and appears to have slight usage of a 3D engine.I was disappointed with the actual control of the game . Racing is very difficult to control . It seems the slightest tap will send you ricocheting from wall to wall . This became increasingly annoying when I was trying to place . The recharge ports are also too small to really regain any energy . By the time you are finished being bounced around on the track , you have already passed your chance to recharge . There is definitely a high learning curve in this out of control world.I did not like the game . I enjoyed the first two F-Zero games , F-Zero X more than the original . F-Zero : Maximum Velocity just seems to take more time to learn than I am really willing to put forward . I do not recommend this to newbies of the series . If you have played previous installments , you may find value here , but as for myself , once tossed around , twice shy .	-1
yes when i first got it it was fun and cool and in two days of playing i almost finshed the whole game the only thing i really didnt do was get the last vessel . i do n't think you should get this game instead get mario kart , but if you really want this game get it used ! trust me after playing this game for about a week you wont want it ! got out and get mario kart instead ! i give it a two only because i had fun with it for a few days but now im sick of it !	-1
This is almost a perfect port of the SNES version of this game that surfaced in the late 80 's as a launch title for the SNES/Super Famicom.It gets old quick and tracks all begin to look the same . The ability to do 2-player link off a single cart is the best feature this offers.Mario Kart Advance ( also a SNES title ) represents a 3rd generation SNES title and was more advanced than FZero in it 's day , as a result it 's port for the GBA ( also a perfect port ) is much better than FZero , so if you want a game like this , I would recommend Mario Kart Advance .	-1
Elite Force is my favorite first person & quot ; shooter. & quot ; The story and graphics are all top notch and it was a lot of fun to play . When I heard that there was going to be an expansion pack , I got myself ready for another engrossing adventure.Well , I have to say that I was disappointed . It starts out good , though . You get to walk around Voyager without a time limit , which is very cool for Trek fans . You can read up on past missions , read personal logs and even use a replicator . This is nice , but I wanted to make my way to the holodeck to try the new missions.So , I tried the Captain Proton episode . First of all , the black and white graphics are beautiful but that 's where the fun ends . You ca n't save the game during the single player missions but after completing the Proton adventure within 10 minutes without dying , I realized that you do n't need to save it . There is n't much challenge to it . Plus , the graphics slowed WAY down in may spots for an unknown reason ( is a patch needed ? ) and I had to walk backwards for a while to remedy the problem . When I finally found & quot ; Satan 's Robot & quot ; and the & quot ; girl & quot ; , it was over before I knew it.The other single player missions are uninspired and dull . A malfunctioned holodeck , shooting range and a Klingon base are all you get and the maps are quite small.However , the additional maps for the holomatches are really good . They are much larger and even more graphically detailed . You also get a wider selection of opponents , including Janeway Borg and Captain Proton . Try out the & quot ; Singularity & quot ; map.All in all , the Virtual Voyager is nice but there is n't much too it . If you want a good single player mode , try searching the net for MODS . There are some good ones out there ! The new holomatches save this from being a total disaster .	-1
i do n't want to waste too much time on this crappy game ... it 's just not good at all , and it 's pretty funny how everyone keeps saying it 's good just because other people and game review sites say it is . maybe it 's because this game was made years ago , before better games came along . whatever . nothing sets this game apart as fun or special , be it graphics or gameplay or story .	-1
I 'll be frank . I purchased this game because it was cheap and I miss the old Doom shoot'em ups so I was feeling a bit nostalgic . But I must say that Red Faction is not a very good game . The graphics look like something from Super Nintendo , the controls will definitely get you wacked if the monkey enemies disquised as humans do n't kill you first and the character voices ! My god I though I was hearing people talk through a pillow being stuffed in their faces . Purely Awful !	-1
I am bias , I must confess , I have been a simpsons fan since I was four years old so I have grown up watching this family and as much as I truly love this show . The conversion of the simpsons to a wrestling game went horribly wrong somewhere along the developement lines . I rented this game and I did enjoy the wisecracks and taunts made by the wrestlers in the game and believe me they were worth getting a kick out of . But the problem is you start out with few characters and the graphics are not that great . In most fighting games you now play , you have to know how to pull of certain moves and combos to achieve victory but all I can describe about the control for this game is pure button smashing . that is the only way to win , I tried using particular moves but gave up and resorted to pushing misc . buttons after about fifteen minutes . I believe that this would have been a much better conversion onto the Playstation 2 if anything . That would have impressed all those simpsons fans out there . But , sadly this game disappoints those true fans to the show . The only reason I gave this a 2 star rating sadly was out of my sympathy for the simpsons . This truly was a Great Concept Gone Horribly Wrong .	-1
I rented this game from Blockbuster because I knew it could have been either great , or terrible . It was near the terrible line . The graphics were n't great and overall , it just was n't good enough to be a good game .	-1
This game is a steaming pile of [ ... ] that stepping in may cost you [ ... ] ( luckily it only cost me [ ... ] ) .The Simpsons and Wrestling are two of the most popular shows on TV today and two of the few shows that i make sure to catch every episode of ... every week . Now some marketing genius knows that the PSX is in dire need of a Simpsons title , but they know none of the Simpsons games made under the Acclaim license were really any good except for the immortal Simpsons Arcade game.They figure `` Hey , Simpsons , and Pro Wrestling , the kids will love it ! `` The problem is , any kid in their right mind will not love this . As far as Pro Wrestling goes this is not it at all . Steaming burps , massive weapons coming out of nowhere , jumping 8 feet across a ring.The graphics are downright ugly . The characters look all wavy and messed up . They tried to make a 3D simpsons and wound up with a very 2D-ish cartoony game that would n't stand on 16 bit standards.The gameplay is not there , not there at all , button mashing on top of button mashing will not get anything to work in this game , if you rent this without a manual you 'll be doubly confused.The sound is not as bad but not good at all , small voice sampling and really really unfunny clips , it 's the actual TV show voices but they sound like they 've been clipped from episodes and put together for the game.There is no replay value , because it stinks , it 's pitiful.I rented this game and i want my [ ... ] back on top of money for all the distress and punitive damages that this game has put upon me.May god have mercy on the souls of the people at Activision who made this stinker ( This is the company that made Tony Hawk , Spiderman , and Vigilante 8 ? ) .The thing that really irks me is that some of the best games ever have been cartoony takes on sports . Like Punchout and Ready 2 Rumble for boxing fans and Mario Kart for racing fans , so on and so forth.However if you want a wrestling title for your playstation , i recommend Smackdown 2 , THQ did a great job with everything except the graphics on it , and the arenas look good , it smacks of fun and replay value.If you want a good simpsons title , email the folks at Activision and tell them to make the Simpsons Racing game for GCN and PS2 not stink .	-1
22 Characters ? More like 16 . And It 's not even wrestling , it 's smacking each other around with pinning . Do n't buy it , it 'll only kill your love of the simpsons . It only got a star because the dialouges are funny .	-1
Who does n't love the Simpsons ? I certainly do ! ! I watch all their episodes ( new and old ) . And what 's not to love about them ? They 're silly , funny , and witty ! ! I ca n't say i 'm a big Simpsons fan but i am a fan none the less so when i saw they had a wrestling game for playstation , i said i had to get this game ! ! Well , like some of the Simpsons episodes , this game was disappointing . it was n't all that interesting and the wrestling moves , i thought , were limited . and it 's a very easy game to beat but then again , some of you might like that . In any case , it was still fun for an unchanllenging game . It was only fun for about 10 minutes.I would n't recommend this game at all unless you like simple fighting games . And if you are a Simpsons fan , you 'll get it anyway regardless whether the game is n't all that .	-1
This game is nothing more then a mindless filler . A second-rate Smackdown vs . Raw ripoff . The story is stupid as heck . The garphics look like they were made by a drunk 4 year old . It 's very gimmacky and cartoony to say the least . I give this game a 0 out of 10 .	-1
I could n't even get through the first level . The graphics are n't 3-D but that 's okay because the colors are awesome . I do n't like the levels and the powers you can get . It seems very boring for me to go around and punch cages and weird ... bad guys . The levels are really bad and it 's too hard . Not a good GBA game .	-1
Dont blink ! By the time you open your eyes the game will be over . I was so excited by this new half-life release that I placed an advance order , and I am really dissapointed.If you are familiar with the half-life series you know what to expect . Great graphics , great story line , and of course great fun . However , I think that the guys over at sierra have a lot of nerve considering the length of this game.I am not someone who sits for hours and hours playing , Nevertheless , I finished this game with in two days . If you dont care about the short ride than I suggest you spend the money . On the other hand , if you are like me , and expect to get what you pay for , than hold on to your money and get a game thats worth the money , such as Deus Ex .	-1
This game is almost exactly like the original half life , but ten hours shorter . The game starts out in a tram ( sound familiar ) and then all hell breaks loose down at black mesa for an unkown cause . Im sorry , but I do not think that the original half life is even that good , so when this expansion pack came out i was not that excited for it . Though I was n't that enthusiastic I picked it up , and once i started playing I officially lost my taste for all half life games . Even a novice gamer could finish this game in a matter of 4-6 hours of casual playing . No complex puzzles , terrible sound , terrible graphics even with the new high definition pack , and way to much of the slide effect when walking . Overall this game is short and leaves gamers unfulfilled , though it does contain opposing force , i still feel the 30 dollar price tag is way to much for a game with uncountable faults .	-1
This review is for Half-Life : Blue Shift ( H-L : BS ) and the High Definition pack ( HD ) , If you want information about H-L:2 or Half-Life Opposing Force , you 'll need to go elsewhere.To wit , this game caught me by surprise . One week , my usual foolish salesperson was ranting and raving about the soon to be released H-L : BS and next week , I see it in stores . I admit that I bought every single Half-Life ( H-L ) I could get my hands on from the original H-L and the Promo CD that came with ATI Rage cards , to the poorly done Gunman Chronicles ( GC ) . I 've downloaded and installed nearly every & quot ; hot & quot ; MOD that was flung out onto the web . So naturally , I snatched this up when I saw it in the stores.The HD pack offers very little other than enhanced characters and weapons . What I mean by enhanced is that the weapons are supposed to look more realistic , that is all ! The levels look exactly the same . The A.I . did not improve any . It 's really not worth the extra stress that the graphics would place on the hardware . Let 's face it , the HD pack is not worth the price that any one wants for it . It should have been available for free much like the Team Fortress Classic . ( I suppose it may be , I have n't checked to tell the truth . ) So how is the game ? Some of the most disappointing work I 've seen . True , the level of detail and the devious level design are truly ingenious . I spent as much as thirty minutes on some levels trying to find my way about only to be thwarted by a well hidden tunnel or a well placed jumping pad . But despite the great levels , there are n't enough of them ! The game is so short that I would have been better off playing GC which , up till now , was the shortest H-L based game . The game ends so abruptly that it 's like a car hitting a brick wall . I sincerely thought that I was going to see some awesome programming prowess with a car I could actually drive ! When it ends , it 's , BAM ! Just like that . I mean , where were all the extra stuff that I saw when I was riding the train ? Oh . . . I walked right by it , I suppose . Where 's the & quot ; old & quot ; Black Mesa base ? Oh , wait . I 'm walking around it now . That 's a train yard ? I 'm not a train buff , but those train cars are impossible ( Look at where the doors are placed on the cars ) . Are n't I supposed to be in the same base as Gordon Freeman ? Oh wait , I guess I am . Oh well. & quot ; OK , & quot ; I thought , & quot ; the game 's over , I 'll try it online. & quot ; Guess what ? There is n't any online gaming via H-L : BS . I checked with my original version of H-L . There is no online gaming if you just install H-L : BS . I 'm guessing that the player can play online if they install H-L : O4 but that 's just junk . The box clearly states that there is Multi-Player and it implies it in two different sections . One part for H-L : O4 and another for H-L : BS . What 's the deal ? So I read the manual , the box says it has Multi-Player support , the manual clearly states that there is a third pack in & quot ; game & quot ; called OpFor : On Line . What ? It also clearly states that Multi-Player is only available in H-L : O4 ( Page 8 ) . What a joke . More hard drive space gobbled up unnecessarily.If you like H-L and you do n't have the O4 pack then by all means buy this game . Otherwise , avoid it until you see it in the bargain bin . None of the & quot ; extras & quot ; are worth the incredibly short game and they really add nothing new by way of & quot ; new & quot ; . I had to give it two stars since I gave GC three and I consider this game a step down from GC . Sorry folks , it 's just not worth it unless I see it in the bargain bin .	-1
that was my expression as I beat teh game ... no end boss , no new weapons , this game just does n't feel like opposing force or teh original half life , at 10 bucks I 'd suggest buying it if only for the high res pack and a quick run through the levels , but the game itself is n't that good , its not much combat mostly puzzles until the last 2 levels.My advice stands as : Buy it if only for the high res pack packaged in but dont expect much from teh game .	-1
I 'll be quick and to the point ... this game is NOT Final Fantasy ! ! ! Did I mention it 's also bad ? The story , music , and gameplay is as flat as the cartrige it 's made on ! SaGa Frotier has been wildly praised as the worst Squaresoft game ever produced , and it 's no wonder why ! The only reason it came here as Final Fantasy is because they figured that 's the only way it would sell ! My advice : Skip this game !	-1
There is no doubt that Final Fantasy Legend ( SaGa in Japan , billed as Final Fantasy in the United States to boost sales ) was a highly advanced game for its time ( 1989 ) . However , it offers nothing that its sequel does n't offer , and the game is , shall we say , very poor . Not having the advantage of color that its contemporaries ( Dragon Warrior , Final Fantasy ) had , the graphics are so poor that they were actually bad in 1989 , which says a lot . The story is about as simplistic as they come , and you should be able to beat this game in a few hours no problem . Considering its limited availability now , I doubt anyone will really want to play this game - trust me , you are n't missing anything . My fellow & quot ; old school & quot ; RPG players will call me a heretic , but this game has nothing memorable to offer . Skip it .	-1
the final fantasy legend games are a perfect example of the gameboy 's limits which makes the game unplayable for me save your money and buy final fantasy 4 , 7 , or 9 .	-1
Having bought an import GBA , I was grabbing at any chance I had to get a new game for it . It was too expensive to buy many import games , so I had to wait like anyone else for a new game . So , when Majescos titles hit the sales floor , I grabbed this one , looking to be the most exciting of the bunch ( having already played the highly mediocre Pitfall remake and beating Earthworm Jim . ) Little did I know I was falling for one of the oldest tricks in the books . People will be lining up for new GBA games even before the system comes out , so if your game is first on the shelf , it will probably sell . Majesco knew it had some mediocre titles , so they put them out extremely early to help guarantee sales , and it shows.First the good things . I heard that it had incredible scaling effects , but I never expected this . It is gorgeous at first . It will knock your socks off . Then , you start to notice how repetitive the game is . Each level is unique in the flight zone , but never changes . And , from lack of anything better , it has a password function.And on to the bad . This game is no fun to play . It is extremely difficult and aggrivating . The powerups are non-existant and hardly add any power to your ship . And there is hardly any reward for knocking out fighters , because they still tend to hit you , so all you do is avoid getting hit 90 % of the time . There is no fun to it and is too frustrating to be played often , killing the replay value.So my opinion is to only get this one as a show-off of the insanely good graphics of the system , but dont let the person play more than 2 minutes or theyll get the wrong impression of this great new handheld . Just sit back and wait the wekk until Castlevania and F-Zero come out and catch this one in the clearance racks in a month .	-1
This game has great graphics . thats about the only great thing about it . I just dont like the game i guess . the graphics are awesome though . a typical japanese animated game , with the best explosions you will see . as it claims , it is 3d , for the most part . Of the 4 games i bought , this is the least interesting but has the best graphics . The music is also ok , as it energizes and & quot ; pumps up & quot ; the audience.One thing that i definitly did not like , is that you have to beat the game on one life . that means that on 2 levels you can not lose a life . each time you beat a level it will give you a password , but if you lose four lives on the first level , you will have one for the rest of the game . i am not too good at these kind of action games , so i didnt get past the 3rd level.The game play is poor overall . maybe im being to hard on it , but it is just horrible . when there is an object right in front of you , your ship blocks your vision , making you shoot blindly . throughout the 7 levels , it is just the same , horrible gameplay.Another ok thing about this game is that it can stand a large number of ships moving on the screen without a single bit of slowdown.The graphics and sound brought this game up from one star , but 2 is still not much .	-1
The first time I laid eyes on Iridion for the GBA , my mouth watered when I saw the gorgous graphics and surprisingly realistic explosions . When I played it though , the experience became quite a different one . There are a lot of times when your ship blocks your view of what your shooting , and even when you can see what your shooting at you ca n't judge the distance , and with so much on screen action at once you will suffer a lot of cheap deaths . The control is awkward as well , and there are times when the game is just plain unforgiving . But like I said , the graphics are beautiful , so if you like games with gorgous graphics and real shallow gameplay , this is for you .	-1
This is a quest through the jungles of South America , you are an explorer equipped with a short whip , a sling ( slingshot ) , and a boomerang , against a jungle of animated snakes , spiders , deadly plants , quick sand , annoying monkeys and so on . The controls first of all are annoying having B as the jump button and A as the attack , L as the boomerang and R as the sling . Then next , the background graphics are so needlessly detailed , that you can hardly tell what is part of the level and what is part of the background ! The animations are cartoonish and annoying , because its impossible to lets say do a small jump , the player will always takes huge leaps ! The levels are very large and detailed , each has a different theme , but there are traps , where you can actually fall from the end of a level back to the beginning and have to do it all over again , making the game very tedious and frustrating ! If you want a fun game , along this genre , take a look at the Gameboy Advance game , Lady Sia . Its also very unfortunate that I have given this game one star , because I have never given anything one star .	-1
The game looks good on paper , but it 's very difficult to play . The missions are pretty much all the same , and the controls are very difficult , and you ca n't really see your enemy even on the backlit screen of the GBA SP . Avoid .	-1
This game was one of the sorriest game boy advance games I have purchased . Its not the sorriest and that belongs to Metal Bots .	-1
Very simple building of a tetris castle . Biggest challenge is determining what shape is falling after your castle gets higher and the piece is hidden behind the score . Graphics are very simple , music also simple . After an hour of playing you 've seen it all . Nearly all Atari 2600 games have more complexity and game play . The L and R buttons are reversed , you push the R button to scroll to the left .	-1
Fortress is definitely an odd spin on the old Tetris formula . You start by dropping blocks to create a fortress . Instead of eliminating lines , as done in the classic Tetris , assembling a 3 by 2 grouping of 6 blocks will create a solid stone . After completing a predetermined amount of your & quot ; Fortress & quot ; , you will be given a catapult piece . This piece will be used to attack your opponent 's fortress.At first , the game appeared to be a Tetris clone . I started stacking blocks between two flag poles . This seemed rather easy to me until the flag poles started to move , then it got a little frustrating . After blocks started fusing together , I started to get the general idea . The enemy began firing at my fused blocks within the first minute of play . I realized at this point I probably should have read the manual before playing.The second time playing Fortress , the point behind the game still eluded me . Granted , I was now stacking blocks like a pro , but this time , the bombardment still continued as scheduled . No matter what I do , the game will not allow you to build a castle and completely defend it . I equate this game to building a sandcastle on the beach . Lets say you build it in the tide . Every time a wave comes along , it destroys a part of what you made , so therefore , you can never complete your castle . You keep doing this until frustration sets in and you quit all together.I do not recommend this game to anyone . Fortress is a poor attempt to modify the Tetris formula . This game fails to entertain on any level . Unless you need a paper weight , skip this title .	-1
This game gets lost in what it wants to be . Strategy or Puzzler ? Sadly , it does not do either well . Fortress becomes dull very quick . The different & quot ; stages & quot ; are cosmetic and provide no real game play value . It is over way to fast . Rent it first but I do not see this game high on many people 's lists . My standards for a pocket game are pretty low . All I expect is something to kill time on a trip or just sitting around . Fortress feels like forced labor in which you never get anything done .	-1
A little while back I bought this game at a store , for [ $ $ $ ] , because I thought it looked fun , and it seemed at the time to look alot like Worms : Armageddon , which I really enjoy . When I got home I hated to say that I wasted that money . This game is not appealing to me , although it may be fun to some who are tetris fans , since this somewhat resembles that , but thats what I found odd , because I liked tetris , but this made me yawn after 10 minutes of gameplay . There only few levels and you just have to make a large building and blast down your opponents building . You can not even shoot when you want to . All that you do is stack and then lay back and watch the slow combat take place . Well , I hope I am not the only one who does n't care for this game . I do n't know what was on the creators mind when they were making this , but I do n't think they succeeded in making a great game . One-star-rating is a little harsh , but , this just is n't a game for me ... .	-1
This game does not do any justice to Castlevania because the game 's dark ambience is totally destroyed by GBA 's poor screen . Do n't even think about playing the game under anything other than ideal lighting conditions . You just wo n't be able to see much on the screen . I was foolish enough to buy the game to play on my subway commute but boy , was it a true nightmare.The gameplay itself is classic . You scroll to explore the environments , so it 's very easy to play . Konami should have lightened up the display and made the game GBA-friendly . Then I would have given it a three-star or higher .	-1
This was a shock to me . For one thing , this game was raved all across the internet . For another thing , I 'm familiar with the series ( as far back as the first three NES games , to the SNES one , and Symphony of the Night ) , so I thought this would like those . Well ... the gameplay mechanics are here , it seems , but everything else ... Lets figure this out piece by piece . First , the graphics were okay . Even though they 're dark , and even though they 're a bit lacking in animation ( only THREE frame to show the main character running ? ? ! ) , the style was okay , and it added to the environments.The sound was nice , and the music was great , but everything here just seemed like it could be done much better ( the music sounds a bit MIDI-ish , but the melodies are good ) .The controls ... here 's where everything really goes down hill . I 'm no stranger to the Castlevania control scheme , having playing the first four games . However , for reasons I can not fathom , this game has by far the worst control setup of all of them ( which says alot , because I 've replayed the first three games recently , and they have n't aged that well ) . First , controling your character is much like controling a big wooden stick . While the same could be said for the first four games in the series , this game takes it to far worse extremes , especially when considering the enemies move so much better ( in other words , they 're attacks seem more suited to a game that has you moving your character as franticly as a Mega Man X or Mega Man Zero game ) . Also , the option to have the whip spin by itself became rather annoying . Unlike Castlevania 4 , which allowed you to move the whip around by holding the attack button down , this one only makes it spin on it 's own , which is somehow amazingly counter-productive . Some of the abilities are nice ( high jump , wall jump , etc ... ) , but they do n't alieviate this problem much , and actually require over-utilization in some areas ( trust me , you would never survive the final battle without high jump ) .Now the gameplay . I 've played other games that used the `` Metroid-vania '' style ( free exploration , found in Symphony of the Night and Aria of Sorrow , as far as the ones I 've played ) . Somehow , this one takes that system and just makes you lost . Seriously , this castle was not as fun to explore as all of the others . The boss battles ( mostly refering to the last 4 ) were super cheap , requiring me to over-use the DSS system to the most extreme , which was a far cry from the more `` down to earth '' battles from Castlevania 4 and Aria of Sorrow . Much as I enjoy difficulty , I ca n't stand not being able to have a clear shot at a target with my whip due to the enemy being over-sized or too quick to dodge.This is by far one of my most hated Castlevania games . If you even think about buying this game ( since a lot of other people liked it ) , I recommend you find a way to rent it first . Otherwise , you may get yourself into a snag like I did . Lucky for me , this was only $ 15 at K-Mart , which is about as low as GBA games get .	-1
I expected something like SSX 's trick system on a basketball court , I mean how could you go wrong with that formula ? Obviously EA Sports Big did . This game is a good rental , tops . Buying it is suicide , because I beat it in two days and unlocked all the characters ( including the gigantic Chinese guy ) and all the courts.What makes this game so lackluster is no four player support , which is a must for any sports game , downright awful play-by-play announcing , and repetitive gameplay . I played it with a friend for a while , but we agreed it lost it 's appeal quickly . NBA Jam is still the best hoops game off all time , while NBA Street is only a memory .	-1
I played the original Firepro Wrestling on the Sega Saturn . It was released in Japan only and I needed a translation in English to do anything . My friends and I played this game over and over . In fact we still , to this day , say CRITICAL ! Which is one of the few English words we could understand . When your wrestler was totally defeated he would be CRITICALed . The wrestler creation capabilities were and still are the very best offering from any wrestling game . It was 2 dimensional then and is still 2d on the GBA . If you are like me and do n't care about graphics you may still enjoy this game . I bought it on Amazon and played it for about 3 minutes before checking out the wrestler creation . I was shocked to find the format had changed , but the tools for creation are still the same as they ever were . However my gaming tastes have changed a lot since 1999 , and 2 dimensional graphics are just too hard to go back to . I can acknowledge the greatness of this game without actually enjoying it , but if it did n't cost me only 5 bucks I would be wrighting a way worse review . If you still pick up Mario Bros. now and again or if you run out to by every new Namco or Midway or Capcom `` Classics '' game . You may enjoy this game way more than I do now . You might actually get as much enjoyment out of it as my friends and I did 6-7 years ago . If you are either under 26 years old or are currently playing X-Box 360 or X-Box Live games like Halo2 , steer clear of this one . 1999 rating 8.5 out of 10 . 2006 3.3 out of 10 .	-1
I bought this game with high expectations because of all the great reviews on amazon , in magazines , etc ... Plus the fact that i have been a fan of music all my life , especially DJ type stuff which MTV : MG2 claims to provide . but if you really want to make some GOOD music i would advise against it . first off every single vocal-riff is terrible and almost hurts to listen to them . the vocal-riffs all sound `` pop , '' meaning you hear some annoying little 18 year old singing `` ohhhhh yeeeaaahh baaaby . '' most of the riffs , other than vocals , are pretty chill but if you want to actually put together your own songs and not lift from other artists it is hard to make a solid rythem . the reason for this is because in riff-edit mode you can only point to one key at a time which is a real ... . In all honesty this game just ins't very good . if you really want to make some GOOD music then take your money elsware	-1
This game is just weak , no strong quality that u would hope forpros:1 lots of dbz caracters2 fun for few secscons:1 waste of money2 it needs a adventure mode3 you will get tierd of it	-1
Dragon Ball Z Budokai is horrible . The graphics are ok , but the gameplay is slow . I 'm not a big Dragon Ball Z fan , but I do like good fighting games and this is not one of them . I would not recommend buying this game , if you are DBZ fan then you might want to rent it .	-1
Pros : - Portable with the GBACons : - Horrible graphics.- Horrible soundtrack.- Very boring , have other GBA games that are very much funer and have better graphics.- PS2 version is mcuh better.- Mini games are n't even worth playing.Overall , if you mistaked to buy this , just playing if you have absolutely nothing else do to . To other people who are going to purchase this , do n't , it 's not as good as you think .	-1
This game is frustrating and will make you want to bust your TV , if not your Playstation . Say what ! , the only way to advance is to get first place ? Okay , after time and time again , once you know the courese and can probably race it blind folded you can get it . You ever play Driver ? Remeber the very last level when you drive the president and these black cars are constantly ramming you ? Think of how that made you feel . You will get that same feeling when you place this game .	-1
I do n't own this game . BUT - I 've seen it played on a PS2 ( I own an XBox ) . Overall , I was unimpressed . The graphics look old and the towns crackling with pixelation . Kind of like the games I was used to on our old computers ... nothing compared to the smooth , defined glow of the graphics Burnout 3 has on Xbox . You start with total crap for a car , and are supposed to build up as you `` break into the underground '' . Really , you go crawling around in your tank - it says you 're going 120 but it looks like you 're going 35 . Honest , I could imagine one of the pedestrians grabbing a skateboard and keeping up with the cars ! In Burnout 3 , you literally rocket through the levels , flying at crazy speeds weaving in and out of traffic . Gets you excited . I watched someone drive their car in Midnight around for a while and about fell asleep ... plus , no car damage , or not much . The old school `` shove others out of the way , my car 's invincible '' gag.Maybe it 's just me . Maybe Burnout 3 spoiled me , or I just have alternate tastes . But I do n't get why so many gamers stand behind sub-par games . Silent Hill 4 was supposed to be good - CRAP . Halo 2 , perhaps the biggest game ever , was hyped to the max - BOR RING . Maybe I 'm just got particular tastes in games that I just have to realize , for I 've been disappointed recently.Want good games , I suggest Burnout 3 , Wolfenstein for a shooter ( its okay ) and Mortal Kombat Deception ( bloody good fun ) . But I do n't recommend this . Ugh .	-1
I love racing games . My first experience with a killer racing game was Rage Racer on PS1 . I loved R4 , Gran Turismo , and Gran Turismo 2 , and Wipout 3 on the PS1 . The PS2 's pure racers have been more sparse for me . I loved GT3 , but short of that , I consider the best car game on the system to be GTA3 and GTAVC . Now , to the subject at hand : Automodellista breaks the one big rule of racing games . It has horrible physics . Rent it first , please . Watch one of your replays . Yes , you can come to a full stop just turning , and I 'm not talking powersliding to a stop , you just stop when you turn . Also , I 've hit a wall and watched my car , with it 's center of gravity fixed , rotate . The tires are n't the source of propulsion in this game as they are in GTA and GT.Money ... Rage Racer and the Gran Turismo series add fun because you have to buy the cars and buy the upgrades . There is no concept of money in AM . You want a viper , sure , have one . You want another , to paint different , sure , have another . Any car , you got it . I 'm talking before you race one race.However , the graphics are stunning , but who cares.Rent it so you know ... Do n't just trust me ...	-1
Auto modelista is a huge let down as far as racing sims go with only one saving grace . The thing that matters the most in a videogame is the core gameplay , length , and replay value , and auto modelista falls flat on its face in all three categories.First of all the core gameplay . The game has very short , unmemorable tracks , which is really a shame because the graphics are excellent . The cars drive terribly , powerslide around every turn . As for the car selection , the game consists mostly of uninspired import cars , and the occasional viper or corvette.As for the length of this game , it took me roughly 3 hours to beat , which is laughable compared to the 35 hours i have on final fantasy 10 , and im still nto even close to done ! The longest race is 4 or 5 laps long across a tin race course , really the load times took more than the race time most of the time.As for the replay value , once you beat the game , your done , might as well use this game for kindling in your fire place . Yes , it does feature online game play , but it is terribly uninspired , and just as boring and brief as the offline expierience.So what is the one saving grace of this game ? The pretty graphics of course ! Through all of the flaws the light of graphics does gleam through on this not so shiny gem . Customizing your car is extremely entertaining , and finding all the perfect tones of paint for your car . There is also a wide array of stickers , and a custom sticker maker . The down side of the sticker maker is that it is no where near user friendly , and a tutorial would have been VERY helpful.In conclusion your money is much better spent elsewhere . This is the kind of title that comes out terrible , then the sequel unexpectedly blows you away , so lets just keep our fingers crossed that if there is an aut modelista 2 , they completely overhaul the terrible controls and make the races MUCH longer !	-1
Sorry , do n't buy this game ! The idea of a cell shaded racre is cool , all the hype , the pictures and the new challenger to Gran tourismo are completely false . You have zero control of your car around corners , braking sends your car into some crazy wobble across the track until you slow down enough to go straight ( with added SFX of something reminisent of opening the door to your home on a very windy day and not closing it right ! ) I was stupid - i bought it full price when it came out and hated it the second i got going . Music sucks , tracks suck , sound sucks - cars look cool but overall - IT SUCKS ! Do n't waste $ 1 let alone $ 50 on this heap of steaming stuff ! ! !	-1
I liked the premise of the game , but this game was unnecessarily tedious . I believe puzzles and boss fights should be hard but fun , not hard and tedious . There is no internal logic to the game , which means the game is very limiting in its structures . What you can use in regular gameplay is different from what you can do during boss fights.Other things that inhibit the game play is the camera angles . You do n't know where your monster is coming from , so it could suddenly appear on your side . It seems stupid to see Alyssa run directly into the arms of your killer just because the camera does n't allow you to spin around . And it does n't help the Alyssa is slow , takes about 3 seconds to get to her feet , and is prone to panic attacks.I liked the gore and creepiness of the game . It was emotionally pulling although some of the dialogue needed rewriting . The premise is not all the original but still enjoyable , but all this is inhibited by the gameplay.I do n't know if they 're making a Clock Tower 4 , but if they are , the developers should really study the classic horror games out there , and see why those work .	-1
this game sucks . If you want a truly disturbing game play the 3 fatal frames on ps2	-1
I have played Xenogears for exactly 2 hours and 30 minutes now , and I have fought a wopping 5 random battles that arent worth my time and have had about 10 minutes actually playing the game . The other 2 hours and some odd minutes are freaking cut scenes that arent even good enough to get my attention . The game is not bad though , but DEFINITELY NOT A FINAL FANTASTY OR HIGH LEVEL RPG . Its just a plain run of the mill rpg , so dont expect anything .	-1
I 'll write this review at the risk of unfounded backlash . I mainly focus on the story aspects of RPGs , so I 'll start with that.I 've heard this game has the best story in any RPG . I 've played maybe 15-20 hours and the main character frustrated me so much that I stopped after the realization came to me that she would not wise up . I do n't want to wait another 20 hours before the story gets `` great '' .This game is , well , as many games are , for kids . The female main character is brash , foolish , and screws over the rest of the characters more than once , and harvests no sympathy from me . The male character who wants to `` score a date '' with her is weakly portrayed and serves as comic relief for a younger audience.Many of the other characters are cute at first , from their image to their personalities , and their backgrounds are deadly serious . Yet , much of it is melodrama and becomes unengaging.The reason I 've listed two stars is because the graphics and sound are anything you 'd expect from a Squaresoft founded title , even if it 's been taken over by Namco.As for this `` game '' being a so-called game , it 's functionality is repetetive and boring from the unengaging battle sequences to the endless upgrades you must make for your characters attacks that serve to keep the player busy rather than entertained.This game is even more disappointing than the dreaded FFX and FFX-2 . ... I expected so much more for SquareSoft .	-1
Ok ... .a cutscene here and there , ok ... ... ..a cutscene every freakin time you move , that goes on for 45 minutes is NOT fun . My save game is clocked at 19 hours , and I 'm sure I only played about 3 or 4 of those hours . And when I was playing all I was doing was running around ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! How in god 's name did you all give this game a 5 ? ? You want a good game that 's similart to this , Get shadow hearts ( preferably 2 ) it 's a THOUSAND times better . After playing that , you 'll wonder how the hell you EVER gave this 5 stars , therefore convincing me to buy this AWFUL game.I had more fun playing the Xenocard game than I did with the rest of it . And even that I got bored with .	-1
Xenosaga is not a true RPG , nor is pretty much any console game out there . Saga to me , however , does n't really even qualify as a game , considering you do roughly half as much watching as you do playing , which is extrememly ridiculous . Believe me , I have patience , but when it comes to watching dozens of 30-45 minute cutscenes , you can count me out.If Xenosaga is to get credit , it is for it 's plotline . While it is interesting and thought provoking , it also does n't bother to explain ANYTHING . Yes , this is Episode 1 of a 6 part series , but who cares ; this is a game , it has a 50 dollar price tag , and I damn sure do n't want to pay that much for a game that pretty much rips you off.On one hand , the cutscenes are well made , almost on the lines of MGS2 . On the other hand , the first half of the game features mostly extrememly tedious and boring cutscenes . It is only in the next half of the game where things get interesting , but a lot of people will stop forcing themselves to play by then . Yes I said 'forcing ' , because the gameplay is utterly BORINGG.If theres one word that I would use to describe Saga 's gameplay , its LINEARITY . Stick with me here : you watch a 45 minute cutscene , you run down a hall , take a few turns , fight some random battles , watch another cutscene , run down a hall , fight some battles , watch another cutscene , play through a long , tedious dungeon , watch another cutscene . You get the picture now ? You see , the problem here is , the gameplay and story feel completely seperate . Its almost as if your watching an anime movie , except there are a few playable parts . The big problem is that the few playable parts are extrememly boring . Sure , the battle system is n't that bad by any means , but by the 20th battle , you 'll be wondering why the hell your even playing.And that 's what I asked myself while playing the game : why the hell am I forcing myself to go on ? Just so I can watch another 45 minute cutscene ? From what I remember , games are suppost to be 'played ' , and are suppost to be 'fun ' . Xenosaga is not an RPG . You want a 'real ' rpg ? Play Morrowind or Neverwinter Nights on multiplayer . Do n't get me wrong here , Saga is n't a failure , it 's just that the gameplay feels like a poor excuse to keep watching more cut scenes . I sure as hell am never going to play this game again . I am a huge Xenogears fanatic , and I really hope that Episode 2 does n't turn out like this one . Xenosaga Ep1 is easily the biggest dissapointment for me in a long , long time , considering I have waited for this game for years . Thumbs down .	-1
I just started playing this game , so I ca n't write a great review on it . What I can tell you is that there is a good reason why just starting might end up being the only thing I do in this game.First off the game has some faults to begin with , the graphics are a bit dull if you ask me . The characters are kind of on the blockish side , they walk around as if they have spoons up their behinds . This might pass on the PSX but it 's not acceptable on a console like the PS2 . The characters and visuals seem pretty stale when compared to the sheer romantic artistry and beauty that goes beyond explanation of Final Fantasy X , but of course what does n't . That 's why Final Fantasy is Final Fantasy and Xenosaga is ... well Xenosaga.The Xenosaga plot seems pretty interesting so far , but again this is an RPG and interesting might not be enough . When I first started Final Fantasy X , I will admit I was n't too trilled but then something happened . I ca n't pin point the exact moment but it was pretty early in the game when it just grabbed me and never let go . Ca n't say the same for FFX-2 however . Moving on , I have a feeling Xenosaga has a super great plot , but unfortunately I may not get to experience it because the gameplay has one huge flaw that I do n't think I can handle.I was interested in Xenosage because it was supposed to be an epic RPG . I play RPG 's for the involvement in an epic storyline , I do n't play RPG 's for gameplay . I feel sorry for anyone who plays RPG 's for the menu selections , if you want gameplay there are better genres out there . I always scratch my head when people complain about too many cutscenes in an RPG or that the game does n't have enough exploration . If you want gameplay and exploration go play something else . That 's the problem with Xenosaga , it 's not just an RPG it 's also an adventure platformer and not a very good one at that . The platformer part of Xenosaga is suppose to be the second hand focus of the game and the quality of it shows that , but there seems to be too much of it . There are too many enemies to be avoided by actually using your skill with the controller . There are too many keys to find , too many doors to unlock , and all sorts of rooms that will get you lost . It 's not like it 's there just incase you want to look around . Nope , you find out you need to go somewhere but the map does n't show you where , you have to search for it yourself . This is just not what I look for in an RPG . If this does n't change in Xenosaga soon , I 'm afraid I 'll have to can it .	-1
My husband said he thought I would love this since I absolutely love Final Fantasy games . I did n't care for this game and turned around and sold it within a week of purchasing it .	-1
Many have already written on this game , so I 'll try to avoid repeating what they 've said , but ultimately , this game starts out strong and entertaining enough , but settles into a middle-ground groove that 's neither bad , nor great , but not all too awe-inspiring as the game goes on.The voice actor for Indiana Jones is passable , but not too convincing -- you can tell it 's not Harrison Ford.And unsurprisingly , it dusts off the long-lived stereotype of the dragon lady and at the end , Indiana gets the Asian ( i.e . Chinese ) girl , even though there 's no plausible reason for her to have any sort of feelings for him -- she 's little more than a toy doll for him to have his way with.The ending is dull -- both the final boss battle and the ending cinematic are little reward for having ran , swung , punched and kicked your way through level after level , trap after trap.Good if you 're an Indiana Jones fan , but others should either rent or stay away altogether .	-1
This game does not hold up the voice acting is horrid . The graphics are crap ! And the story is just not interistting . Good for a good cheap thrill nothing else	-1
I have been waiting for this title to come out for a long time , but sadly I 'm disgusted with how this game plays and looks . If I 'm not mistaken this company is creating [ edited ] . If that 's the case , it 's not a good showing for what to expect . The graphics on `` Shell Shock '' look a few years old , the movement of the character is slow and rough . And the overall feel for the game is boring . Compare this game to [ edited ] There 's no comparisons . This is a definite trade-in and title to forget .	-1
This game is terrible ! I went and got it the day it came out and played it for about a half hour and hated it . This is coming from a gamer who is only into mature titles , mostly war games such as [ edited ] The reasons this game sucks is too many to list but be warned ... wait for [ edited ] !	-1
I enjoy many racing games . . . GT3 , Burnout , Rallisport . . . but this one is horrible . Handling is fine , graphics are beautiful , replay fun , but everything else does n't live up to the hype . Sound : you can not hear the cars , the cheering washes out the cars and no way to adjust what sound is at what level . Tracks : are odd and irregular . And AI seem to cheat a bit . . . but that is in every game to a degree .	-1
The first game we played on Gamecube was Spongebob , Battle for Bikini Bottom . We absolutely loved it and my daughter plays it over and over . Thinking Shrek 2 would be similar , we rented it . It 's very hard to control the c-stick and it kept zooming in and out and would n't rotate the camera except for certain times . The charactors were very distant and even if we used the c-stick to zoom in , it still was n't close enough . It 's the same feeling as needing to put eyeglasses on to see something more clearly ! Another aspect we did n't like was the four charactors are always together and you would lose track of which one was the main charactor . Maybe we 're spoiled because the c-stick on Spongebob allowed you to rotate in every direction to see what was around you and the graphics were so good you could see facial expressions . It 's surprising all the reviews are so good because our impression was completely opposite .	-1
This game suffers from an unusual problem that most sequels do n't : it seems the developers listened to the gaming community . The first Spider-Man The Movie game was a lot of fun , but it had it 's limitations- it was too linear , there was no room for exploration , and your activities were limited to the skies and rooftops and a few indoor areas . Spidey-fans and gamers alike wanted more room to swing and more opportunities to use their great powers with great responsibility- but less linearity.S-M2 bucks that trend . In a nod to Grand Theft Auto 3-style gaming , the city is now yours to explore . There are huge skyscrapers , dark alleyways , and bustling streets . You can either choose to follow along with the linear plot , seek out mini-missions that net you points you can use to purchase upgrades , or hunt down hidden items ( for no apparent reason than a higher overall score ) .While great in concept , the implementation is sorely lacking . There are only a handful of randomly-generated mini-mission types ( car chases , robberies , air-land-and-sea rescues ) , which forces you to replay the same tired action sequences over and over and over . Fun for a bit , but not for hours and hours of filler . The way the game is structured , you have to purchase upgrades to progress- so you are forced to take hundreds of these mini-missions to follow the game 's main plot.Swinging around the city is lots of fun , and you get a bunch of different upgrades ( web zip line and slingshot for example ) that are n't really functionally necessary , but still add to your enjoyment . In addition , you can pull off weird midair Tony Hawk-like stunts ( also purchasable ) for no apparent reason other than that they are marginally enjoyable as well.The main plot is well done . It diverges from the movie and adds in some nifty comic book characters such as Rhino and the Black Cat , but the generally outline- defeat Octavius and win back Mary Jane , remains the same.The fighting system has apparent depth , but most combat against non-bosses can be resolved with button mashing . It can be fun at times , tossing bad guys left and right- but after awhile pounding thugs into the pavement or hanging them off lampposts looses all semblance of a challenge . S-M2 is also the 700,000 game to feature a Matrix `` bullettime '' mode . Yawn.So much could have been done with this game that I ca n't help but suspect that we were given an unfinished product set to be released concurrently with the movie . It is truly a shame.Not worth the full purchase price . Rent or buy used unless you 're a Spider-Man fanatic . If so , find a good sale ...	-1
Ladies and gentlemen be warned . This game is a popular series that has -- until this point -- been very enjoyable . But Treyarch has seriously lost their touch . Spiderman 2 starts out as a wonderful game , the ability to visit street level and foil `` everyday crimes '' around the city is awesome . But the `` level bosses '' ( fights that you must complete to move on ) are terribly designed . One level ( Mysterio 's burning theatre ) is impossibly difficult simply because of the terrible web slinging controls the game has employed . Another level ( Statue of Liberty ) is so bad that you 'll want to return the game . This game deserves no honors whatsoever , since the designers spent too much time trying to do `` cool '' things , rather than making it playable . Go back to the older Spiderman games and you 'll enjoy yourself a lot more .	-1
They say if it ai n't broke , then do n't fix it . I loved the first Spider-Man game . The graphics were crisp and detailed , the story was deep and involving , and the controls were precise and tight . Then Grand Theft Auto : Vice City came out , which completely re-wrote the video game genre . Games like True Crime and The Getaway were released that practically copied the GTA formula : Free roaming cities , mini-missions , mayhem and violence , etc . Add Spider-Man 2 to the list with mediocre results.I admit that I was initially excited when I heard that Spider-Man could now swing freely through the city and bust bad guys on the streets below . Though the former is exhilirating and excellently implemented , the latter is dull and repititious . Like GTA , there is a mini-map of the city in the upper right hand corner of the screen . Whenever there is trouble , a green icon will appear in the location where a crime is taking place . Unfortunately , there is a lack of variety in these missions . You will either have to prevent a robber from getting away , take an injured civilian to the hospital , catch a civilian from falling to his or her death , or save people from a sinking boat . After a few of these , you 'll begin wishing that the game would just get on with the story . Solving these missions contribute to your `` Hero Points '' which allow you to purchase moves and combos from a Spidey Store . Since when did Spidey have to buy his own moves and combos ? Strange ... Unfortunately , due to the heavy reliance on memory and processing power to produce the massive scope of the game , the graphics are the first to suffer . In most instances , the game resembled a Playstation 1 game . Spidey generally looks good , but the other characters in the game look like spray-painted cardboard boxes . I would have preferred a much scaled-down city in order to boost the quality of the graphics because quite frankly , Spider-Man 2 is an ugly game.Fans of the first game will most likely be disappointed with the sequel . Though the ability to explore the city by swinging from building to building is a treat , the gameplay and graphics truly suffer . This one is definately a rental .	-1
I purchased this game on June 29 and popped it in immediately , getting all revved up for the enjoyable experiance of being everyone 's favorite friendly neighborhood spidermanThen the load screen happened , and I gasped.The colours only use a 4 wheel spectrum for the most part dating back to the origianl spider man comic book game on the PS1 . The characters mouths do n't move , the hands are mittens and the colours when you get up close are n't that great either.Now the game play . The swing machanics , even on extreme , are simplistic and do what the game tells them to , as for roaming around the city , it 's not enjoyable or fun . You have maybe 4 variety of missions which you MUST do before getting on with this story . None of them are fun or creative.This game does deserve two stars though for voice acting , it 's tremedously good and corny . What you 'd expect from a spiderman era game .	-1
Museum Games are more of a lesson in classic gaming than an experience.Namco 's Gameboy Advance release of the Namco Museum follow the same path the Williams has taken in their several Greatest Hits releases . This current installment of the Namco museum includes a roster of five games . These games are : Ms. Pac-Man ( 1980 ) , Galaxian ( 1979 ) , Galaga ( 1981 ) , Dig Dug ( 1982 ) , and Pole Position ( 1982 ) . These games have been fully restored on a single GBA Cart for your portable convenience . Granted it is nice to have five different games on one cartridge , but I would hardly call this a worth while title.I can not site any performance issues , nor can I compare the Namco Museum to any of the current games out there . My reasoning behind this is because Namco fully restored Atari classics and packaged them for a modern system . Though I personally am not keen on this idea , I will admit , it is nice to remember the simple times . Each game is configured to interface with the D-Pad and the face buttons , whereas the shoulder buttons have no function in this package , leaving the controls as simple as the games themselves.To my disappointment , both Galaxian and Galaga are virtually the same game . This means that you are paying for four games , when they advertise five . The slight difference between Galasxian and Galaga is the entrance of the enemies . In Galaga , enemies fly into view and bombard you as they enter . In Galaxian , the enemies are just lined up at the top of the screen , waiting for you to shoot them . All NAMCO needs to do at this point is throw in Space Invaders and advertise six games , but you will still only have four unique games.The bottom line is , the NAMCO Museum is more of a history lesson than a worth while game . I rated this a 2 stars because Ms. Pac-Man and Dig Dug are still fun titles , but the other three just do n't have a lasting replay value . I would pass this title up , unless it was on the discount rack for less than five dollars .	-1
Namco Museum lets you play old Atari classics on your GameBoy Advance . These include Galaga , Galactica , Dig Dug , Pole Position , and Ms. Pac-Man ! This is of course a great idea in theory - I *love* some of these games . But while the games might be really fun to play on a big-screen console , they are REALLY tough on the tiny screen . For example , Ms. Pac-Man comes in two modes - a full screen mode and one that scrolls up and down showing you a partial screen at a time . The full screen mode has REALLY really tiny ghosts and characters , you can barely time your movements and often get stuck on walls . The scrolling mode is better in the sense that the characters are larger , but now you can easily scroll down into an enemy and the same character control issues occur.On Pole Position , it 's all about sliding left and right as your racecar goes around curves . With the arrow-control of the GBA , it 's one light tap to make a hard turn . If you accidentially press too hard on the arrow , you smash into the side signs or nearby cars . It makes driving very difficult.Dig Dug is a great game , where you burrow in the ground and try to drop rocks on the heads of dragons . Is this Revenge of Smaug ? Again , I love the game but the controls make it difficult . You can be planning a careful tunnel to a rock and end up off by a bit , making the tunnel useless.Galaga and Galaxian are both classic space-shooting games . Galaxian is a & quot ; secret bonus & quot ; in that it 's not mentioned on the box but is provided on the cartridge . I really love both of them , but the controls are just as sluggish and imprecise here . With Galaxian having the penalty of & quot ; only one shot on the screen at a time & quot ; , those missed shots make a huge difference in playability.If you have a regular console , I 'd recommend these games on a differnet system . I love the games themselves ! But the GBA version is rather awkward . Everyone I had try this out got frustrated very quickly .	-1
This game has 5 great titles of classic games ! They are Ms. Pac Man , Galaga , Galaxian , Dig Dug and Pole Postion . This sounds pretty decent , but really , no fun is coming out of this . Here 's the reviews on the gamesMs . Pac Man : 2.5/5I love Ms. Pac Man , but it 's impossible to play on this . You play tiny , or huge , kinda like that one world in SM64 . When you play tiny , it 's too dificult to see where the ghosts are and such . The huge screen is useful , untill your scrolling down and run into a ghost you could'nt see.Galaga : 3/5It 's fine , but it 's boring . No value is brought to you when your playing.Galaxian : 3/5It 's the same with Galaga , no replay value at all . I do n't know why that 's happening , but something dos'nt feel right playing Galaga or Galaxian on the GBA.Dig Dug : 4/5This is very fun on this , one of the only games I play ( I 'm gon na sell this game soon ) . But the controls can be funky.Pole Postion : 0/5Oh my god , what happend here ! ? ! ? ! ? When the women 's suppose to say : `` Prepare to be qualified '' all I hear is MMMMMMMMMEEEMMMM ! ! ! It like mumbles . When your turning on this , you are complety messed up , dos n't work at all.Overall : 1/5If your an absoulte Dig Dug fan , get this , if your not , dont bother thinking about it .	-1
Sonic 3D Blast is quite different from the 2D Sonic games on Genesis . Instead of running through zones to get to Eggman , Sonic has to rescue birds called Flickies from Eggman 's robots to proceed . I 'm fine with rescuing birds even if it is a bit strange ( although the idea was also in Sonic Adventure ) . What I do not like about the game is how weak it is . The graphics are not in 3D at all , they are simply set at an 3/4 overhead view similar to Zelda and Super Mario RPG . They are good for the Genesis , but if you want to see better consider getting the Saturn version . The soundtrack is weak , repeats a lot , and normally does not fit the zones very well . Again , if you want an amazing musical score you should get the Saturn port . After the terrible music was muted I found the controls were VERY slippery . I tried it with the standard D-Pad and found it was almost impossible to change direction . Using a joystick is not much better . The controls , aside from not having a proper configuration , have bad traction . Along with the dreadful music and controls is the boss fights . Eggman has been and always will be a wimp , but he hardly is trying in 3D Blast . Normally it is the terrain that supplies the hazards while Eggman flys around shooting something at you.Honestly , I am a huge Sonic fan but I can not stand this game . If anything you should buy the Saturn version , or just play a real 3D game like Sonic Adventure .	-1
I do n't like this game . The 1st one is better . This one sucks ! I expect more from the blue sky team !	-1
Considering how much I 've hated ( and continue to hate ) regular Mortal Kombat 3 since it was first released almost 12 years ago , it was only natural that I would also have a strong dislike for `` Ultimate '' Mortal Kombat 3 . But , if you 've never seen any of my other reviews for other Mortal Kombat games , here 's why I really hate this game.- Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was the beginning of the end for the series because THIS is the game that started the trend of having WAY TOO MANY unnecessary Mortal Kombat games on the market , making everyone who used to enjoy the series SICK TO DEATH of it.- The actual fighting in this game is exactly the same as in Mortal Kombat 3 . Which means , I hate it . It 's like the company knew how much I hated the direction they took the Mortal Kombat series starting with the third installment , so they decided to create more or less the same game but with old familiar fighters returning . They did this on purpose to annoy ME . If the actual fighting stinks , it does n't matter WHO returns . It 's like Midway knew they made a mistake with the original Mortal Kombat 3 by introducing people to a list of all-new fighters , but they somehow DID N'T realize that adding combos and a run button was the main reason Mortal Kombat 3 was such an awful game in the first place . So running around delivering combos is *still* here . BAD move.- I hate when something is supposed to be the complete package , but instead , when you play the game , you find out that a bunch of things are missing . That 's exactly what we have with this game . It 's sort of like opening up a Christmas present to find nothing but styrofoam chips inside . Okay , the game is n't as bad as waking up Christmas morning and being insulted with an empty box , but still ... It would be best to never even think about touching this game .	-1
THIS IS JUST A DUMB GAME LIKE MK 3 WAS . ALMOST ALL VERSIONS OF THIS GAME WAS STUPID EXCEPT FOR THE SEGA SATURN VERSION . BUT , NONE OF THE HOME VERSIONS WERE BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL ARACDE VERSION . THIS IS NOT A GOOD GAME . THE GRAPHICS ARE VERY INFERIOR LIKE THOSE OF THE REGULAR MORTAL KOMBAT 3 FOR THIS SYSTEM AND THE CONTROLS ARE BAD . IF YOU EVER WILL FIND IT AND YOU STILL HAVE ITS SYSTEM , GET THE SEGA SATURN VERSION ONLY ! ! ! ! ! UNFORTUNATELY , THERE NEVER WAS A PLAYSTATION VERSION FOR THIS GAME . THE LAST MK GAME THAT WAS RELEASED FOR SUPER NINTENDO BEFORE THE SYSTEM WAS DISCONTINUED FOR THE NINTENDO 64 .	-1
The Sega Genesis version of this game is no where near as good as the arcade . In fact , I would say that it does n't even come close . There are stages missing , Sheeva has been removed from the game , & voices have also been removed . The Animalities that are in the arcade version have also been removed . The music also sounds nothing like the arcade game . Scorpion 's fatality has been changed . So has Stryker 's Friendship . The only good thing about this game is that the hidden characters are instantly unlocked . If you are expecting alot from getting this title on the Genesis , you will be severely disappointed . If you have to have it as part of a collection , make sure that it 's cheaply priced .	-1
This game is basically just an upgrade to Mortal Kombat 3.It brings back some old characters that were not in MK3.Such as Scorpion , Reptile , Kitana , Jade ... as well as a few new ones such as Rain and Ermac.The Sega Genesis port and The SNES ports were kinda bland.It 's been awhile since I played this game , but from what I can remember , there were some missing elements to this.I think Sheeva was missing , Animalalities were taken out , and a few backgrounds were gone too.Also with this Genesis version , you will also need a six button pad to play it.Like with MK3.Unless you wan na put yourself through the torcher of using a three button controller.My best advice would be to just leave UMK3 alone and pick up Mortal Kombat Trilogy for another system instead.It 's got everything this game has and more.Only buy this , if you are a die hard Genesis collector , or if you do n't own a Playstation , Nintendo 64 or a Sega Saturn .	-1
I am appalled at the fact that this game is so repetitive and developers ca n't seem to make a good Godzilla game ( I 've seen the reviews ) . Seriously , is it really that difficult ? This game is incredibly boring and repetitive and is not fun . All you do is direct Godzilla where to go , and during that process he destroys the same buildings over and over again relentlessly with no purpose in doing so . He may destroy a tank or fight a boss here or there but it is incredibly boring , and I really do n't see how these other amateur critics gave this game four stars ! Avoid this game people , it 's too repetitive and boring for anyone except idiots . So just wait for the day a good Godzilla game comes out because this one is just bad .	-1
You should have seen the look of disappointment on my face when I first played Mortal Kombat 3 . I actually received the game a day before its official release . My dad 's ex-girlfriend found a copy of it somewhere and bought it for me . While that was a nice , unexpected thing for her to do , I really do n't like the game.I hate Mortal Kombat 3 not only because many of the classic fighters of the past are n't included , but for another MAJOR reason- the actual fighting sucks . I absolutely DESPISE the fact that combos have been added to the Mortal Kombat series . Nothing more irritating than doing really well in a fight ONLY for the computer to suddenly get this amazing burst of energy and charge at me with devastating combo after devastating combo . That right there ruins the game *completely*.Speaking of combos , actually being able to pull one off is almost impossible thanks to the way the game company designed the combo system . They made it so you have to press a BUNCH of buttons *exactly the right way* at *exactly the right time* or else the combo wo n't work . Yeah , I 'll really have time to properly do THAT in the middle of a fight ... The fatalities are horrible-looking . They look *really* cheap . The fatalities in Mortal Kombat 2 are graphic and bloody , but the ones in THIS game are terrible because they are so darn cheesy-looking . They are n't as violent as you 'd expect them to be in a Mortal Kombat game . In fact , the amount of blood in the game went down *considerably* . A *little* wave of blood splashes from your opponents body when you punch or kick them , and I hate it *so much* . It 's almost like a normal fighting game . If it did n't say `` Mortal Kombat '' on the box you would n't even know you were playing a Mortal Kombat game ! I hate the fact that they modernized the levels so you can fight your opponent on the city streets with buildings and other normal-looking things in the background . I have news for you- EVERY fighting game features a city level . I thought the people behind Mortal Kombat were more creative than to copy what everyone ELSE is doing . I guess not.But the one thing that makes the game worthless in my opinion is the fact that there seems to be a bug in the game that makes the computer REALLY cheap-shot you after you win just ONE fight in the tournament . For instance , let 's say you start a tournament with Liu Kang and you have the game on easy mode . You defeat your very first opponent in two straight rounds and move on to the next fight . No problem , right ? Suddenly *for no reason at all* the next opponent will RIP YOU TO SHREDS with combos and other things , giving you NO TIME AT ALL to respond . You lose both rounds and have to do the fight again . Remember , this is on EASY mode.Let 's say , you try it again with Liu Kang ( or anyone you want ) . For some reason , NOW the fight is easy . NOW the computer is n't throwing combo after combo at you and NOW you can complete the fight without much of a problem . You beat your opponent in two simple rounds and move on to the next fighter . Guess what ? The INSANE cheap-shotting has returned , and in a matter of seconds you die in two rounds . You 're shocked and confused that the game has turned into INSANE mode . Time to hit the continue button . You pick Liu Kang as your playable character again ... nah , let 's make it Kabal this time . Guess what ? The fight is BACK to easy . Your opponent is dead in two rounds.You ca n't understand why the tournament fighting bounces back and forth between easy and INSANELY difficult . After all , you put the game on easy , it SHOULD BE EASY ! The next opponent you have to face ... yup , you guessed it- nearly impossible to defeat him until you die and try it again ! ! Do you see the pattern here ? After you beat an opponent easily in two rounds , the next fight will be *just the opposite* with you having to face an EXTREMELY challenging fighter , and most likely you will NOT be able to beat him . But the NEXT time you face him he *will* be easy ! Do you see why the tournament is so frustrating ? You win , you die , you win , you die , and the tournament will keep going like this until eventually you run out of continues and therefore , die . NO WAY can you put a positive spin on this.That 's the dumbest and cheapest thing I 've ever seen in a fighting game , and that 's the main reason I hate Mortal Kombat 3 more than ANY other game . At the very least , when you enter a tournament on easy mode it should START off easy and *gradually* build to a challenge by the time the final opponent rolls around . Not any of this `` easy this fight , impossible the next fight '' crap.Avoid Mortal Kombat 3 forever .	-1
MK 1 and MK 2 were pure gold . MK3 adds some cool characters but it totally sucks . The AI makes this game nearly unbearable they are super nazi cheese kings that know your every move before you even do it and magically avoid your moves and counter everything in a quick and cheese bs fest manner that the player con not come close to doing . The unfair level in this game makes it only fun playing two players . The bosses are unfair cheese lords too . This just sucks other than the new cyber ninja 's nothing to care for here .	-1
THIS VERSION OF MORTAL KOMBAT 3 SUCKS . THE CHARACTERS ARE BORING HERE , THE GRAPHICS ARE BAD , THE MUSIC IS BAD , AND THE FATALITIES ARE N'T AS GOOD IN THIS VERSION . THIS IS NOT REALLY A GOOD VERSION OF MK 3 TO BUY . BUT , MK 3 WAS N'T REALLY THAT GOOD OF A GAME TO BEGIN WITH . IF YOU WANT THIS GAME , I SUGGEST YOU LOOK FOR THE PLAYSTATION VERSION AND LEAVE ALL THE OTHER VERSIONS OF THIS GAME ALONE . THIS WAS ONE OF THE LAST 2 MK GAMES THAT CAME OUT ON THE SUPER NINTENDO BEFORE IT WAS DISCONTINUED FOR THE NINTENDO 64 .	-1
product was advertised with original book of codes and did n't come with it ... kinda Necessary if its use is to be of valued..and the only books available are twice what the genie costs ...	-1
The Saturn was a briefly popular 32-bit video game system created by Sega in the 90 's . It was designed to compete with the Sony Playstation and Nintendo 64 . Unfortunately for Sega , the Saturn ranks a distant third in terms of enjoyment value.Looking back , I 'd say the Sega Saturn really is n't that bad a system . I used to play it with my friend and I 'd say I had a *little* fun . It 's just that Sony was pumping out an *unbelievable* amount of excellent games during the EXACT time Sega was trying to market the Saturn and , as you know , Sony came out of nowhere and grabbed the attention of millions and millions of video game fans . This made it VERY hard for Sega to keep up with the surprising success of the Playstation . Sony was n't fooling around back then- they were on a mission to dominate the video game market and BOY did they ever succeed . It permanently changed the video game scene ; destroying the console wars between Nintendo and Sega . Sony coming out of nowhere and almost *immediately* ruling the market pretty much spelled the end of Nintendo and Sega being the only two video game companies competing with each other . Now a THIRD company entered the mix . To put it another way- Sony temporarily brought Nintendo to its knees and , in the process , knocked out Sega forever . Sega was never able to recover from the damage Sony had done . Everyone thought Nintendo would be the company to destroy Sega . Nope ! Nintendo came close a few times , though . With Sega 's well-known history of bad marketing techniques , this might have been for the best . I bet Sega would have continued to struggle if they had made the decision to keep themselves in the console-releasing market after the Dreamcast was finished . I bet Sega would be looking pretty ugly right now , in terms of sales . Good thing they pulled away.Because the Sega Saturn did n't have a long life , the few people out there who actually own one HAVE to notice its main weak point- not very many games to choose from . The good Saturn games you CAN choose from are either really rare and expensive , or import games never released in America . That 's the biggest problem with the Saturn . Just not enough.To give Sega credit , the Saturn DOES have some quality games such as Virtua Fighter 2 , Guardian Heroes , Radiant Silvergun , Shining Force III , Sonic Jam , Nights and Dracula X. BUT- and here 's the important thing I want you to remember- it would be IMPOSSIBLE to ignore the many crappy games released for the Saturn . Worthless games such as Corpse Killer , Bug Too ! , Incredible Hulk : The Pantheon Saga , Hi-Octane , G-Vector and The House of the Dead do n't exactly show off the Saturn 's amazing capabilities . Also keep in mind that the Sega Saturn was an *extremely* awful system when it came to sports games . Just about every basketball and hockey game released for the system is n't worth a darn . To me that 's surprising when you consider the Sega Genesis was known at one point as the best video game system for sports games . You 'd think Sega would have continued the trend of releasing quality sports games for the Saturn , but they did n't . Another disappointment.Everyone likes to point out that the Playstation is the video game system with the highest amount of crappy games . That 's only because Sega gave up halfway through the competition with the Playstation . Argue with me if you must , but the Saturn was basically dead by the end of 1997 . The Playstation was just getting warmed up by that point . If the Saturn had continued to compete with the Playstation until say , the year 2000 , the Saturn probably would 've ended up with JUST as many horrible games . Sega gave up in 1997 when it finally dawned on them that Sony was putting them out of business.Mostly jealous Sega fanboys like to point out the high amount of terrible Playstation games , while Playstation fans correctly understand that you have to sort through a lot of junk to get to the GOOD games- and believe me , the Playstation had a LOT of good games . In fact , the best Playstation games are better than the best Saturn games , in my opinion . Give me Silent Hill and Resident Evil 2 over Nights and Shining Force III ANY day . It 's a shame Sega fans will never stop defending the Saturn with the same old argument . Time to give it a rest.In case you have n't noticed already , it bothers me that Sega fans do n't seem to mind all the junk that was released for the Saturn and instead point out all the crappy games available for the Playstation . That 's like saying the mosquitos in Miami are n't NEARLY as bad as the ones in Tampa Bay . Does n't make much sense does it ? So why am I defending the Playstation 's crappy games ? Because I find it a little bit inaccurate ( and rude , to be honest ) that Sega fans completely ignore the crappy games available for the Saturn and instead focus on the crappy games for the Playstation 1 . I just want to point out that yes , the Saturn DOES have its share of horrible games as well , despite what Sega fans would like you to believe.I think Sega fans are confused when they say overall , Saturn games feature less loading times than the Playstation . For a supposedly powerful video game system , you sure had to wait a LONG time to play a game on the Saturn . For example , you have to sit there for an eternity to play games like WWF : Wrestlemania : the Arcade Game and Mortal Kombat Trilogy . Compare those loading times to the same games on the Playstation , and the wait is n't NEARLY as inconvenient.What makes the lengthy loading times on the Sega Saturn even MORE frustrating is how , right after the `` now loading '' screen goes away , the screen turns black for a few seconds making you wait even LONGER . There 's no 3-seconds of blackness on the Playstation . The *very* second the loading screen goes away on ANY Playstation game , the actual game comes in . Sega fans like to pretend those few additional seconds of loading are n't happening . Trust me Sega fans , I DO notice them . I DO realize that I 'm waiting 3 extra unnecessary seconds to play the darn game . The Saturn is MUCH worse when it comes to loading times . It 's SO slow . None of this matters anyway , because by the end of 1997 loading times were almost completely gone anyway ! If only the Saturn had survived long enough to see that.Besides the loading problem , most of the time the Playstation had the superior version when the same game was released for both systems . This was because the graphics were always clean and sparkly on the Playstation . On the Saturn , after they finished creating a game it was like they rubbed the graphic engine in the dirt . Either that , or the person who put the colors in all the Saturn games could only see in black and white . All the bland , colorless backgrounds on most Saturn games make me feel like I 'm digging a hole to China . Poor , severely-dated graphics . For a good example , compare the two versions of Castlevania : Symphony of the Night . Once again , the Playstation version smears it . The Saturn version features ugly , grainy and ugly-colored graphics . If a game appears on both the Saturn and Playstation , compare the graphics and I guarantee the Playstation version will look better.I can think of only one thing the Saturn did better than Sony- the CD Player built into the system is actually more interesting on the Saturn . On the Playstation it 's just a boring , predictable layout of hitting `` Play '' `` Pause '' `` Forward '' etc . On the Saturn you have a LOT more options , and the neat-looking background showing a countless amount of shooting stars is pretty impressive to watch while you sit back and listen to the music from the CD you put on . None of this means the actual quality of the CD player on the Saturn is better- just that the outer space background and addition of more options makes it LOOK better . They both play CD 's very well.It 's a shame the Saturn could n't hang with the big boys . It could n't hang around long enough to see sequels to many popular games such as Resident Evil , Mega Man and Tomb Raider . All those sequels went to the Playstation and turned out to be VERY successful . If a game like Resident Evil 2 had appeared on the Saturn , who knows how successful it would have been . Sony seriously put a hurtin ' on Sega.Funny how the Playstation 's gray-colored ordinary-looking system design is actually more attractive than the Saturn 's silky-black `` cool '' color . What 's that expression ? Never judge a book by its cover . Right ! I think back to that Sega commercial ten years ago showing a Playstation falling from a building and a guys voice saying `` fly , play thing , fly '' . hahahahahahahahaHAHAHA ! ! !	-1
Do n't expect any realism in this game . After all the reviews I thought this was the best thing to ever happen to video game basket ball . It 's alot like the old NBA JAM games for super nintendoexcept instead of two on two its three on three . You do pretty much the same tricks over and over again on each possesion and then dunk the ball . Sure the dunks look cool and nothing is better than throwing the ball off your friends head but after a while its all the same . There is no goal tending so the best thing is to have a 7 footer like shaq just guarding the basket . since its first to 21 pts ( normal shot=1 pt , long range =2 pts ) during a regular game you can get at least 2 blocks , most likely 7 or 8 . In addition to the score of the game you get pts for doing scoring . There is n't a good was to explain this except give an example . After doing a couple tricks then dunking you would get about 50000 pts . For just shooting the ball ( no dunk ) you get around 50 pts . three pointer will give you 250 pts . These pts add up and at the end of each individual game you get reward pts . Reward pts can be used at the store to unlock hidden features . The only thing a team needs to be excellent is to have a person who handles well ( so during tricks the ball does n't get knocked loose ) and a big man . During game play , you fill your game braker meter by doing tricks . Fill it once to do a level one game breaker . If you choose not to use it you can pocket it and fill it again to do a level 2 gamebreaker . Level one game breakers add 1 pt to your score and take away a pt from the opponent for a shot from inside the three pt line . you can shoot a three and get two pts and have one pt taken away from the opponent . The downside of just shooting threes is that you get a lot higher score for dunks ( if you do a level two gamebreaker after a couple tricks and dunk it could get as much as 500000 pts ) . One really nice feature is the be a legend mode where you create a player and pick up a few teammates and take them to the street for pick up games ( as opposed to the regular nba mode ) If you finish the nba mode first you can build a better begining player to play with , but for more of a challenge you can start out fresh . You go to courts and play the best the city has to offer . It has alot of games to play before you finish so it 'll take around 10 hrs to play . A major flaw to me is that players ca n't be traded . Western Conference teams made alot of moves during the offseason and we ca n't play with the new teams . That means lakers do n't play with payton and malone , timberwolves wo n't have sprewell or cassell Robinson is still on the spurs and so on . The game is a good game to play with friends but after a while its just boring .	-1
Every time I order this product , the company sends me NBA Street the first one . I 've ordered this game four times . I 've given up on this game . Send it to HELL !	-1
The Daredevil movie was good , but this game has little to do with it ( other than the picture on the box ) . Forget the storyline , or the repetitive gameplay , or the boss battles , and even the radar sense ... where 's the save function on here ? There is none ! That 's right ! Instead of being able to save your game , you have to write down the & quot ; passcode & quot ; they give you to get you back to your place in the game . Not since the wonderful days of the SNES have we resulted to such an idiotic method of saving games ! And do n't tell me the capability is n't there , because they have it in virtually every other GBA game out there . The sound effects are fine , the graphics are pretty good , and the response is ok . If you 're just a huge fan of DD , grab a pen and paper to remember your save code and go for it . Not recommended .	-1
Feeling like like making a mistake ? Buy this game , then ! Made its bad graphics , impossible passwords , and lack of fun will convince you what a mistake you made . Enjoy fighting crappy unpopular bosses like the Sewer King , the Hand ninja klan thing , Echo ( easiest boss ) , and the first boss ( harder than Kingpin ) Elektra , who has suddenly , without any explanation , has sprung back to life . Fighting Bosses just depends on luck , no strategy . Enjoy your waste of money ! !	-1
About the only thing the DD GBA game has going for it is the fact that it does n't star Ben Afleck ( and in a game this bad it 's a good thing ) . The Man Without Fear deserves better than this brain-dead side-scroller that takes players on a listless jaunt throught Hell 's Kitchen to beat up people using feeble martial arts and acrobatics . Yawn-inducingly generic level design and lousy graphics might have been forgivable had they implemented this neat little invetion called COLLISION DETECTION that games use today , although using DD 's radar sense to detect hidden items and boss weaknesses is kind of cool . Still , see the movie before you play this [ game ] so you 'll get some thrill out of it .	-1
Let me get one thing straight . I love the Tony Hawk franchise . Everytime a new Tony Hawk game comes out , it consumes my life for at least a month . My entire world becomes a huge skatepark , as I start looking for a good skating line everywhere I go . However , the reason Tony Hawk has become such a popular game is because it is a skating game that is actually easy to control , that just about anybody can pick up and play without any trouble , where you can do insane inhuman tricks that most people would never think of attempting in real life . Unfortunately , the Game Boy Advance version of Tony Hawk 's Pro Skater 2 is very hard to control . The game needs to be 3-D , not 2.5-D , like this game is . You will find yourself constantly turning the wrong direction because of this . In addition , the awkward placement of the buttons on the Game Boy Advance can be very frustrating . If you are used to playing on the Playstation or N64 , it will take quite some time to get used to hitting the R and L buttons for the moves , the A button to ollie , and the B button to grind . I constantly found myself hitting the wrong buttons.When it comes down to it , you will be playing the same Tony Hawk as you played on your Playstation , but with fewer levels . Because of the aforementioned control problems , you will not be able to pull off the insane stunts and scores that you could on your Playstion version . Even if you could , your character is so small that it would not look nearly as cool as it did on your TV at home . Why bother ?	-1
Tony hawk2 is a great game , but if you are good at thps , espescially thps2 , this is not a game for you . Not . While its fun for a while , it gets really easy to beat . after a while ( 3 days ) i was able to beat the game with any character in 20 minutes . however , if you dont intend to play this game all the time , maybe only on roadtrips or during a plane flight , then its great . good graphics , good sound , nice cheats , but the controls are somewhat lacking . gameplay is downright bad . dont think im some jerk , though , i loved this game at first . its just too dang easy and repetetive . get advance wars .	-1
before i played the demo of this game , i thought it would be awesome , like a better version of rune from the ps2 , but alas , i was sorely disapointed.I was looking forward to the fast paced action that made the movie gladiator exciting to watch but this game is turn based.Turn based ! what were they thinking.I know there arent that many turn based games around so its a change of pace from the norm , but why on such a cool looking game ? i was sorely disapointed .	-1
Wow i honestly expected more from Lucasarts , but this game is by far the worst game i 've ever played in my entire life ... and i 'm not being overly dramatic . Not only are the graphics disturbingly horrible , the voice acting is dull and repetitive . The story is interesting but it 's random ... like really , REALLY , random . Add to this is the games mind numbingly boring combat scheme that makes dragon age feel like call of duty , and the ridiculously jacked up money/store system . And perhaps the worst element of all ... the music ; the music only has ONE TRACK , that is played over , and over , and over , and over , and OVER ! ! ! When my sister and i played this , the music got so annoying that we turned the music volume to zero . This game could have been so much better . No wonder Lucasarts decided to not make anymore medieval-themed games .	-1
This game should be in the Platinum Hits sections . No , make that the Old Copper Penny section . Paying anything over 10 bucks for this game would be a mistake . Only hardened RPGers will like this game ( you know the type -- the guys who sit over by themselves and even the computer nerds wo n't talk to them ) . After Sudeki , Fable & Jade Empire comes out , Gladius will be relegated to the Bargin Bin right next to Pong . Anywho ... this game is about as much fun as visiting a friend 's dying grandmother in an old folks home ( unless of course , you enjoy that sort of thing ) .	-1
This is a good game , but having to enter a sixteen character password is unforgiveable . The game costed.. , it should have a battery backup . I was assuming it would .	-1
I 'm going to get straight to the point on this one . If you already own Ghost Recon , I highly suggest you do n't waste your money on Operation Flashpoint . You are going to end up so disapointed you 'll probably quit buying computer games for a month . Heres why : The graphics are pretty impressive . However , you just do n't get the same `` feel '' as you do in Ghost Recon . It 's more `` video game '' graphics than realism . It 's almost a glorified super mario brothers type graphics . Get the idea ? The sound is another issue . It just does n't make you feel like your actually out on the battle field . The radio transmissions will give you a headache and confuse the heck out of you before you can actually understand them . Ever turn on the TV when the cables out ? You know the white snow noise ? Imagine playing a military game and 90 percent of the time that 's all you hear.The gun fights are boring . You get shot at by little dots that look like soldiers about 100 meters away . You do n't actually feel like they are on top of you like in Ghost Recon.The BOTTOM LINE is this ... If you want a Realistic military infantry game , go with Ghost Recon . It 's got the graphics , and the sound that you expect from a great military game . If you do n't beleive me , play both of them , and you 'll quickly see what I 'm talking about . Take your money and go with Ghost Recon , you 'll be VERY happy you did.Take care . **Update**I currently put this on my new system ( 2.8ghz P4 Geforce 4 Ti 4600 etc ) to see if it was any better , and same result . Decent game , but not up to par with whats out there . Its getting cheaper , and the price is getting closer to what its worth .	-1
This game ranks up there with possibly being the WORST game I ever played . I got the demo way back when it came out and I loved it . I played it just about every night for a few weeks and had mastered it . I bought the game when the price went down and I installed it . The game bugged out on me in training and I could n't drive the truck like I was supposed to . I gave up on it and a week later my computer basically tanked . I assumed that was part of the problem with the game , as I was having trouble with other games that used to play fine . I happened to have lost the game for some time and I finally found it in a box in my parent 's house two years ago . I took it and finally played it a while back and I was completely at odds with the demo I remembered so well and resurrected to play before starting the game again . The game played nothing like the demo and I swear that I was losing EVERY mission even if the goals got completed . I never understood how to use the `` tactical map '' for a long time and when I finally figured it out , it still did n't help . The friendly AI has as much sense as a cardboard box , the enemies are apparently sharpshooters with tanks , and it seems that while you only take 1-3 bullet wounds to die , the enemy takes at least 10 . The graphics were awful ( and it is n't due to me being spoiled by newer games since I still play MS-DOS games on occasion ) . I could n't believe how terrible this game was . It has been put into a box so I can forget about it .	-1
I am wondering if I played the same Operation : Flashpoint as the rest of the reviewers because this was the latest in a long line of terrible military 1st person shooter games . The graphics are mediocre , while the playability is absolutely horrible . I took this game back and exchanged it less than an hour after buying it . It ranks among the worst military shooters I have ever played along with the Delta Force games , the Clancy games ( The Rainbow Six series that is ) , and others . Do n't waste time or money on this ... game . It 's disappointing that no one seems to be able to come up with a good 1st person military adventure shooter game . The only two decent ones I 've seen recently were Medal Of Honor and Return To Wolfenstein . Again , do n't waste money on this awful game .	-1
I was quite excited about Operation Flashpoint after playing the demo . It seemed the most realistic portrayl of warfare yet on the PC HOWEVER , after a failed installation I went to various websites attempting to find a soloution . I read through 30 pages of people expressing problems with the patches , installation , textures and various other features of the game . I am sure that for those of you who can install it , it will be nice however , check out the ... to see what the people who have problems are saying . I would not recommend a purchase of this game until you can be certain the bugs are fixed .	-1
first off i am not one of these people who get easily discouraged , However with that said i could not even fishn the game cause it was no fun . This game suffers from realism at the expense of fun . First off lets get the basics down , The graphics stink and compare to the same games od that year it should have been betterthe controls are ok but the vehicle mission control are awefulthe weapons are plenty bet there accuracy leaves much to be desired.the levels are vast and you can do alot in them i will give it that.The story is not all that revealing and the characters feel fake rather than realThis game if for anyone who values realism over fun that aint me i play games to enjoy the experience . however there might be people who like realism more than fun and if so this is your game	-1
This is the worst . I want my money back . Klunky , lost , unplayable . I would give it a minus star if I could .	-1
I wonder who was the genius who came up with the idea of glorifying and incorporating hip-hop style violence into a video game whose target audience is made up of teenagers ? This game also shows that it is fun to beat up on women . There 's already enough gang violence in our nation 's inner cities , we do n't need little suburbanites to follow in the example of violent criminals .	-1
This game was a sinch to beat , its boring and it does n't deserve to be rated . Thats all I have to say .	-1
`` Twisted Metal : Black '' is an extremely violent game , beyond that of most first-person-shooter video games and war games . As one example , driving after intentionally hitting someone then the game has the person stuck in your front bumper as you drive around . Yick !	-1
When you first start playing TMB , you will be saying to yourselve , `` WOW '' , until you play it for 1 or 2 hours straight , and then realize that it was n't want you expected . One reason why the twisted metal series was so great , was new innovation to the car combat genre . unfortunately no new innovation has added to this game , in fact you could stay it going downhill . The game lack so much stuff that make all the other series look like winner . What the game lack is n't in it graphic department , but it most important aspect of any game , the gameplay . It fast , infact it super fast , how can a 16 wheeler go as fast as a motorcycle , and realize how lame and such a poor excuse the developer of this game made it . The car physic is probably the worst i have ever seen . It never feel like your actually driving on the ground , every car has the same physic driving . Instead of driving like any other game , it drive more like on ice and hovercraft style . It lame , and also it very hard to hit your opponent . Also every game is a handicap game , not only do the al do n't shoot each other but that all the al are all trying to destory you . It does n't take long before a barrage of missle is aiming for your cars . This take so much away from the game , that for beginner will be totally outwhelmed . It also pretty hard on the easy setting because every game is a handicap games . Now talk about going downhill , there is no replay , extra , and no clear objective to any of the mission , but rather on objective and that is to destroy how many cars the game want you to destroy . Put in bad graphic and poor gameplay with an unexcusable 14 cars only , and you get a poor quality of a twisted metal game that the only thing going for it was the hype .	-1
I 've tried the cable out with my cousins , and we have not found any games that have let us play two player yet . I left the cable with my cousins knowing they had more than one gameboy advance , suggesting that perhaps the games have got to be exactly the same in each system . I am still unaware of any two player games they may have gotten to work .	-1
This game is a bit short . It has a few alternate routes , where you are allowed you to choose to go left or right at certain checkpoints . But these alternate routes are very short , and do not make a big impact on the fun of the game , or the story of the game . So there is not enough replay value for you to go back to choose one of the alternate routes.House of the Dead is more interesting in that the story moves along differently depending on which rooms you go into.Confidential Mission may appear like a copycat of Virtual Cop , but I own both Virtual Cop games for Saturn and they are a lot more fun than Confidential Mission .	-1
Oooh ! Horrible Horrible game ! I saw reviews here way before the game was released . Come on have you played it before you gave it 5 stars ? Just the prospect of the game ? Feel free to spend your money and see how it stacks up to CTP2 . Of course , Call to Power 2 was not perfect but this is abysmal . You WILL notice that the playability is extremely hard and vague compared to Activision 's CTP2 . Wars are strange with no stacking and each soldier fights another one ! ! How realistic is that ? Trading is so vague with no idea of what 's going on unlike CTP2 where trade routes are clearly shown . Diplomacy is also toothless and you do not get to compose a message nicely like you can in CTP . And there are many more instances that show Sid Meier is losing his touch or he does n't have enough resources to hire enough programmers and do a good job.Mark my words , you would be better off saving your money for CTP3 ! !	-1
Civilization III has all of the aspects that made CIV II and the original huge , time-guzzling monsters . Every turn involves the micromanagement of every possible aspect of running a society . You have to decide what to research , what each city should build , if all of your citizens are happy enough not to revolt , what terrain squares to upgrade , and endless other options . The time system in this game is ridiculous . You have generally from 4000 BC to 2050 AD or less to achieve a victory . While over 6000 years may seem like a very long time , when the game clicks off 50 , 20 , 10 , and/or 5 years a game turn , that time runs out quickly . Even at the lowest difficulty level , your adversaries are given huge advantages over your civilization . They can seemingly create super units with little or no build time , supporting dozens more units than your civilization ( even if they 're the same size . ) The enemy 's units are harder to destroy , always seeming to win even fights . Their units can move across terrain features that would take your same units multiple moves in a single move , and they can even run away twice when your units can run away only once . The diplomatic AI , supposedly more advanced than the previous versions , still demands ridiculous deals and the game never allows you to make similar demands or respond in the same way to those demands . Game balancing is almost non-existent , in so much as a battleship ( of the World War II type ) can be easily destroyed by Iron Clads and Frigates ( of the American Civil War era . ) Submarines that are supposed to be invisible to enemy units ( with the exception of a VERY select few according to in-game help info ) will always be attacked by ships supposedly incapable of seeing them . Your units are always forced to fight to the death if they are the most powerful ( but not healthiest ) unit in a given stack , while their units are allowed to change their defense to always defend with the healthiest unit in a stack . I could go on for hours about the excessive , abusive , intolerable , demoralizing , shameful cheating that the computer opponent is allowed to commit in the name of `` BETTER AI . `` On the technical side of the game , the interface is unintuitive and generally ugly . Menus are in strange places , and your advisor screens are nearly impossible to get useful information from . The graphics are a warmed over version of the Civilization II game , and the sound and music are embarrassingly poor quality . Response time is a major issue , with late game enemy turns taking 30 seconds to 1 minute per enemy . Start up time for the game itself is good , and I have not experienced any crashes with this game ( patched version 1.16f ) . Also , the game manual is large , but uninformative , and the index and table of contents are almost useless in aiding you in your search for some obscure game quirk.Overall , this game is not worth your substantial amount of time and money . If you must purchase it , try to save as much money getting it as possible , and find all the trainers and cheat codes you can get , because this game DOES NOT PLAY FAIR .	-1
I am not faint of heart nor am I unschooled in playing pc games - there was a time when I played Civ II so much I could barely get to work the next day . This incarnation of the game looked and sounded fun so I bought it based on the raves I heard ... . The graphics are fun , its nice to have everything in 3D but that is about the only upside to this game.The things that I was looking forward to the most , new trade and diplomacy options , are a bust . Trade is easier now but you just really can not get anything useful out of it . Trade does not function well . You have to have a sea route or a land route to an AI country to trade with it . Once there is a sea route you and the AI need harbors . But the AI 's do n't build harbors for centuries , even when they can . For a land route , you have to build a road . You can expect that the closest AI will also always be your enemy so good luck trading with them or though them ( you can but you lose the route when you go to war with your neighbor . All the AI 's almost always demand more than the trade is worth . Then they are very happy to drop trading with you and trade amongst themselves , cutting the human player out totally.Trade and diplomacy are inextricably linked now . This gets to the biggest disappointment - diplomacy worked much better in Civ 2 . Diplomacy is a misnomer in this game . AI 's demand , you basically have to give in . You ask and MAYBE can get what you want by giving up everything you have , only to have the AI become annoyed or furious with you anyway . This is not because I do not know how to negotiate - I do it for a living , you just can not get anything but a bad deal in this game.So that leaves just waging war mostly . Here , the game has picked up one of the more unfortunatel traits of Civ 2 . The AI 's do not have to build any city improvements BUT YOU DO TO KEEP YOUR PEOPLE HAPPY . The upshot is that they have the time and the money to spend building armies that you MUST devote to building other things . A few good tactical victories during the inevitable war usually gets the AI to the peace table but you have to start rebuilding everything destroyed from scratch wasting more time and money . The AI just goes back to building Wonders and military units and then blitzes you with dozens of units the next time around . It becomes dull and repetitous.I would have been happier if they had just taken Civ 2 and improved the graphics - that would have been enough . Instead they ruined the game . Now , I am mostly just bored by Civ 3 .	-1
For people like me who loved the previous Sid Meier Civilization games , Civ3 is a bitter disappointment . There are two seemingly paradoxical reasons for this : not enough has changed , and too much has changed.On the one hand , there have been very few improvements to interface and gameplay . All the things you liked about Civ2 will be too familiar to seem fun , and all the things you disliked about Civ2 are still there and just as frustrating as they ever were . The AI is still berserkly aggressive and will attack you constantly , even when it has no hope of winning and even when there 's nothing to be gained from fighting . There is a way to group units to simplify movement , but it is only available as a random result of combat ( leaders ) or as a capability of a rather high-level tech ( military academies ) that does not become available until relatively late in the game . Thus , moving armies around remains a tedious and time-consuming process of giving go-to orders to each unit individually . Master of Magic allowed you to group units for movement back in 1994 . Why does Civ3 still withhold this obvious labor-saving measure 7 years later ? Most of the time , this game looks , feels , and plays just like Civ2 did.On the other hand , building almost all military units now requires the player to acquire access to certain `` strategic resources . '' This is an interesting idea in theory , but the concept was implemented so severely that it cripples the game . For example , if the random map generator did not happen to place an iron mine near your starting position , you will not be able to build swordsmen , gunmen , frigates , canon , or even build railroads across your empire . You may have researched techs well into the modern era , and still have to fend your enemies off with longbows and spears because the resource rules wo n't allow you to build more sophisticated units . On their website the game 's designers say they intended for players to be able to trade with other civilizations to acquire these neccesary supplies . Anybody who 's tried to negotiate diplomatically with the previous Civ games ' AI rivals knows how laughable this is : you 're expected to rely upon good-faith trading with those same guys who delcare war on you every few turns ! And without a source of strategic resources , you can not build any of the worthwhile military units and your aggressive AI rivals will eat you alive . It 's just that simple . Complicating matters is the fact that the number of strategic resource tiles is proportional to the number of players in the game . The larger the map you play on , the harder it will be to find just those few terrain squares that have the essential resources . Since I prefer to play on large maps , I found myself unable to acquire iron in most of the games I played , and I never , not even ONCE found a source of saltpeter on my starting continent , which in Civ3 means no muskets and no canon . ( Civ3 shipped with an editor that is supposed to allow you to alter the rules to your liking , but I 'm afraid that when I tried this the game crashed . ) The result is that it no longer matters how happy your people are , which techs you 've researched , and which wonders you 've built . Despite its name , this game is no longer about building a prosperous and happy `` Civilization . '' Winning or losing Civ3 depends solely on the blind luck of being granted a source of strategic resources by the map generator . If you want to fight over a few scattered resource tiles essential to mere survival , then buy Civ3 . But if you want to manage and grow a prosperous empire , save yourself $ and break out your old copy of Civ2 .	-1
After about a week of playing , I 'm getting more and more upset with Civ 3 . Here are some of my latest gripes : - The Culture Effect seems to have problems . In one game , even though I 'd built 16 out of 24 Great Wonders and 7 out of 10 Small Wonder , and my Culture , at over 40,000 , was almost 3 times that of any other player ( according to the Histograph ) , I no longer took over cities right next to me . Plus , in a war , I kept losing cities that I 'd taken over even though they were filled with MY troops , all rebels had been eliminated , I was running under a Democracy ( thus immune to Propaganda ) , and all the people were happy ( w/ some as entertainers ) . Plus , when those cities deposed my Governor , my own national military units just disappeared . This is very upsetting.- The inability ( or more precisely , poor ability ) to make actual armies is horrible . First , you ca n't produce leaders , they just appear ( if you 're lucky ) . Secondly , once you have a leader , you can only stack 3 units with him . So , for the majority of the time , you 're stuck building individual units and just sending them in a stream to wherever you need to fight . Combined arms is totally missing.- Corruption makes an empire-building game impossible . I took over another continent . I was ruling under a Diplomacy ( From the manual : & quot ; One of Democracy 's greatest advantages is its ability to squelch corruption and waste . Both are minimal in your cities. & quot ; ) . I had Courthouses in every city ( it 's the second thing I build , right after the Temple ) . I 'd built the Forbidden Palace ( which is supposed to lower corruption , though my Capitol was still on my first continent ) . Upon checking one of my new cities , I found that corruption was eating up 12 out of the 13 shields the city produced . That 's a 92 % corruption rate . With that kind of corruption , there 's no point in ever owning more than a dozen cities.- Units from previous Eras can still damage more modern units . I ca n't count the number of times a single enemy spearman has killed my tanks . This is totally unacceptable.- Diplomacy seems to be brain dead . My opponents do n't seem to pay any attention to my past behavior in determining what they 're going to do to me . I spend the whole game sharing technology , resources , luxuries , maps , etc with these people and all of a sudden , out of the blue , they declare war on me . I 'm not sure how to phrase this . But , they act without any moral feeling ( just like computers , I suppose [ g ] ) .- Resource distribution is horrible . In one game , only one player in the entire world had rubber . Plus , because Trade has been & quot ; simplified & quot ; to the point of disappearance , there 's no real insight into how much you 've got or when it will dry up . So far , it does n't even look like the amount you have has anything to do with production . If you have it , it seems you can make as much of something as you want at a time until the resource dries up . In a game I just finished , I was the only one in the entire world to have Saltpeter , Iron and Aluminum ( and the Iron did n't show up until late in the game ) . Also , even though I could see Rubber , Oil and Coal on the map in other nations , none of these showed up for trade until late in the game . All of those resources appeared linked via roads to cities on the coast . Is the AI so brain-dead that it does n't ever build itself some Harbors for trade ? - The times when resources show up need to be modified . In my last game , apparently , I was one or two Ages ahead of everyone else . I needed things like Aluminum , Rubber , and Oil but they were nowhere to be found . In a frustrating episode , I had Aluminum long enough to complete all but three parts for my Alpha Centauri ship . But , while I was researching my last advance , my Aluminum & quot ; mine & quot ; dried up . There was no Aluminum anywhere on the planet . I finally figured out that if I gifted a nation with all the technology it needed to advance one or two ages up to , and including , the Rocketry advance , the would finally see Aluminum and put it on the market ( I ended up giving that nation 12 to 15 technologies ) . This is dumb . There needs to be some mechanism to allow me to tell some relatively primitive society that I 'll buy that shiney rock from it . Of course , the best way would be to just show ALL resources ALL the time.- Espionage is WAY too expensive . Doing anything worthwhile , correctly , usually costs thousands of dollars . I rarely have more than 1,000 available . Also , it does n't make sense . I tried finding a mole in one of MY cities . I failed and a nation declared war on me . Why should my trying to clean up MY ranks bother anyone else ? Plus , why should I have to specifically say to do this , and pay for it ? Once I build the Spy Agency , this should be standard operating procedure.I 've got another 1,000 words or so of complaints . But , I 'm out of space .	-1
Civilization II is my all time favorite computer game . When I lost that game when a computer virus damaged my hard drive I recieved the Third edition of this series . And what a utter crock of $ h ! t . I am so dissapointed I am almost crying in disbelief.There are so many thing that completely ruin the qualities of this so called game . First you ca n't bribe rival units . Second , there is no cheat mode to toggle . Third there is no complete it button to spend money to build improvements , units , or wonders . God , is there no end to this sorry story.I felt so excited when I got this game for my birthday but when I installed it all it did was crash almost a few minutes after starting and it wrecked my hard drive . Needless to say is that this is nothing but a computer wrecking hunk of garbage.I personally am going to the computer store and am buying a replacement copie of the Second civilization . This one on the other hand will be sitting on the shelf and collecting dust or heading to the garbage can.Maybe if my computer is fixed and upgraded this game will be playable and given a higher rating but from where things stand right now this is one of the biggest dissapointments ever.For those who are rushing out to buy this : Stick with your older versions because all this one will do is eat up hard drive space and ruin your hard drive .	-1
The eclipsing star of the computer gaming world , Sid Meyer , resurfaces to serve up a game that is every bit as exciting as watching lint accumulate . Basically a re-warnmed version of his earlier title , & quot ; Alpha Centauri & quot ; ( a game now in re-release , which will put you back 9 bucks ) , but without all the cool movies that AC offered , Civilization 3 has all the action of glacial movement , the excitement of a six-hour monotonal history lecture , and all the visual appeal of a mid-80 's DOS game.After buying this game , I popped it into the drive , booted it up , and five minutes later , was wishing that I had bought something more exciting- like a program that would monitor the growth of my fingernails . I 've played a lot of games- and over a game-playing hobby that has stretched over the past two decades , I can not remember a title that was so underwhelming , so dissapointing , and so downright boring .	-1
I loved Civ 1 and 2 , and I also loved colonization . What made those games truly great was the endless depth and the ease of play . Civ III is a radical departure from the latter . It is just too difficult to figure out . The interface is clumsy at best and the game play in my opinion has really slowed down.All in all , I am really dissapointed in Civ III . Sid Meir had to fail eventually .	-1
Civ III is much anticipated and I would say quite disapointing . Civ II had a number of unballanced aspects ( howitzers that won ever engagement and railroads that allowed instant transport to name a few ) . However , it was a good simulation of cultural development . Civ III lacks many of the key technological improvements of Civ II ( no rail so you always use the same roads that you built in 3000 BC and no improvments in agriculture ) that makes the game less fun . They should have made the game more ballanced but still kept the flow of history that made it great before .	-1
Now I know what you are going to say , '' Why did you buy this game unsure if it was compatible or not ? `` .Well I had done a little research and thought that , `` Just maybe '' this game would play on my PC.Okay my `` PC '' is an asus netbook but I had upgraded the RAM and felt that I had the system requirements met.Boy was I wrong ! ! ! I was only able to install and get to the start screen , after that nothing.Okay I figured , I 'll just download Win 7 's xp mode . Again start screen and then nothing.I know this is a phenomenal game from all I have read I just wish I could play it.I might even go so far as to buy the OS-X version and put it on my Macbook Pro but not for now.From now on I am making SURE games are compatible before pusrchase .	-1
Get Sid Meier 's Alpha Centauri , the true heir to Civ 2 instead.It 's a game which trumphs this one in all respects except the trivial ones ( like graphics ) .	-1
Pro 's : - Tons of fun at the higher ages.- Requires good strategy and logical thinking skills.- Lets you rebuild history.Con 's : - Takes a VERY long time to get to a higher age.- Imbalanced combat . Example : My military advisor told me to get archers because they 're better than warriors ; then when my archer engaged in combat with a warrior he was easily defeated by the warrior.- Half of the time you 're going to be hitting spacebar to skip your turn.- No online/multiplay capabilites ( unless you waste your money on an expansion ) .- Ca n't choose a starting age.- No campaign/story mode.- Can sometimes take way too long to finally finish a game.Final Verdict : The cons outnumber the pro 's and even though this game can be quite fun at times , it has way too many major issues and if you want them fixed then you 'll need to pay extra money for expansion packs .	-1
There are few games that have made me this angry , I can not believe how unfair this game is . The resources are bull man , I never get salt paper and even if the computer has extra it refuses to trade with me , does n't matter though I 'd bring a ton of cavalries into japan and I 'll just get chopped to bits by their samuri which seem to never end . It seems like no matter how superior your units are the comp can just tear them up with it 's endless supply of grunt units , it ai n't right ... I loved Civ 2 back in the day and mastered it . But this game is unforgiving , the diplomacy is a complete headache , if you want something you have to pay an arm and a leg and you have to give away all your secrets . I do n't know , I liked 2 better , maybe 4 is good but my computer sucks ... ugh . Do n't waste your time .	-1
As you 'll probably know , civilization continues and here 's the newest version of the game known as civ3 . Now do n't get too excited about this game , as more often , you never know how it will end up as . I know , i know , it 's enjoyable but just like civ1 and 2 were , i do n't really think civ3 will make any difference . Gameplay and graphics changed a little bit from civilization 1 to 2 . But overall , everything is the same . Whoever made this game is a person who likes to cheat people into buying this game and wasting their money on some garbage . I 'd suggest buyers think more often about the sims and simcity 3000 and if they have these games , they should be thankful to themselves . Thank you .	-1
I bought this thinking I 'd find a new game , with new units , with some interesting changes from the previous two versions.Instead , I got Civilization that was released in the early 90s with new graphics.There is nothing new that I would justify this being called a sequal . This is simply a re-make of a great game . It 's not worth the investment in the high price they are asking for this item .	-1
This game does not draw you in . It is somehow less enticing than Civ II . It is cold , distant , and impersonal , and feels like the rival Call to Power . I hate to admit it , but Call to Power is better than this version of Civ. , because call to power has neat stuff , such as underwater and space colonies . I did not find any cool units in this game , nor any cool concepts . & quot ; Culture & quot ; is a trick . It does not enrich the game , and often makes the conquest of cities frustrating because citizens rebel and overthrow you -- give me a break . What this game calls & quot ; culture & quot ; is an empty word . Apparently you have to build temples in all your cities and feverishly construct & quot ; wonders of the world & quot ; to gain culture . Slow and uninspring , this game lacks any new imagination . There has been no progress made since Civ II in terms of spicing the game up and making it more interesting .	-1
This game took 20 seconds to get on my nerves . I would expect better response and graphics from an old NES system ! Compared to the beautiful Gameboy Advance translation of Donkey Kong Country , for example , or Mortal Kombat : Deadly Alliance , and 007 Nightfire looks like it 's a game from four computer generations ago.The graphics would n't be a problem if gameplay were a compensation . Unfortunately , the enemies in this game look like white blobs with vague black eyeholes , the sounds and voices sound like they were recorded with a portable tape recorder , and controls ... this game should have been called 007 : Need a Stairmaster , because your 007 moves like he has lead weights attached to him . It takes about a whole second after pressing forward before your agent starts to move forward , and strafing is nearly pointless because of it . The control scheme requires that you stand dead still in order to shift your aim , and that is also slow and ponderous . My thumb hurt after a couple of minutes of dealing with this control scheme , and after hacking through to Level 4 , I just gave up . I happen to value my eyesight and looking at the blobs on the screen was n't doing my eyes any good.I was stunned that Electronic Arts , responsible for some excellent shooters ( the Medal of Honor series , for example ) , produced this atrocity . A game of the lowest quality .	-1
This GBA game is quite challenging , but that 's not my problem with it . The problem is the graphics is low-quality and the levels very repetitive . There 's very little to do other than shooting your way around , and all the soldier enemies look the same . The tiny dots that make up the enemies make it difficult to aim and shoot , so the challenge frequently turns into frustration . All this is not helped by rather poor sound effects . I do not recommend this FPS , at least not for purchase at the current high price . I hate myself for falling for the James Bond license and wasting $ 30 .	-1
The GameBoy Advance Wormlight is one of the few occasions where Nintendo did n't get it right . The only problem that affects the GameBoy advance is its lack of a backlit screen . In normal light , this usually is n't a problem , but for naturally dark games ( like & quot ; Castlevania & quot ; ) and playing in poorly lit conditions , it can be an issue . Alas , the Wormlight does nothing to fix the problem . In many ways , it makes it worse . Instead of providing a broad , soft light to enhance the screen , this light produces a narrow , harsh glare . The glare created practically washes out any ability to see what is happening on the screen . Check out some other lights or just go completely without one rather than wasting money on this one .	-1
Although this game seems quite promising , it is just a mess of bugs , frustrating load-times , and huge patches . First off , the graphics are quite mediocre . The building walls are paper thin and there is really nothing to the buildings other than four walls . The characters are blocky and all of the action looks quite silly most of the time.Hopefully , you enjoy long load times . Waiting for the game to boot up and let you into the server literally takes 2-5 minutes . Even the offline mode takes a good 2-5 minutes to load . And this is with a system that surpasses the recommended system configurations ( I am running a P3-800mhz , 256MB SDRAM , 32MB Video , 40xCD-ROM , and Cable Modem ) . Also , the game says it only requires a 56k modem to play , but even with a cable modem I experience terrible lag in big battles . Also , you 'll hate your 56k connection when it comes to downloading patches ( last patch I downloaded was about 70 MB ! ) .The gameplay itself is n't too much fun either . It is pointless to try and go foot-soldier seeing as how EVERYBODY uses tanks ! Trying to be infantry will get you either run over or killed in one good tank blast . Since you 're able to just select what to use in battle , is it any wonder that this game has become a war of tanks ? In the whole time I 've played I only come across infantry when it 's the person 's very first time playing . After that they quickly learn to just use the tanks . Knowing who to kill will be frustrating as well . Everyone 's name in the game is blue , and although you can not damage an ally , you will spend a considerable amount of time shooting at the wrong targets.All in all , the game is terrible . Fighting the battles is aggrevating , but not as aggrevating as finding a battle to fight ( there are no NPCs , so you have to find other players to fight ) . On many servers you 'll notice the Allies are quite outnumbered by the Axis . Every battle I have played has been won by the Germans . The game is just chaos , no structure , no commanding officers ( unless doing missions , and not really even then ) . It 's basically jump-in , shoot , die , jump back in , shoot some more , die again . There 's no real goal or purpose . No medals to be awarded and no real benefits to acheiving a high rank .	-1
Just a warning for any buyers that the server for this game has had HUGE problems and has crashed numerous times ! Apparently , the server was never tested with the amount of people that would be playing online . Right now , the company is putting a hold on free one-month trial accounts as most people have yet to play the game online.I would wait a few months before purchasing this title . In the age of internet financial disasters , this is another title that was rumored to have been rushed into production because of limited income . ( In other words , the game was n't tested enough to make sure it would work right . ) The game looks fun and exciting if it works , but I would check out internet bulletin boards or news sources before purchasing this game ( and the monthly online payments ) to make sure everything is satisfactory .	-1
First of all I must inform you that in order to play this game online you must download a 70MB 'patch ' file . That is just far too large of a download for those of us stuck with a dial up connection . If you have a high speed connection 70 Megs is n't that big of a deal though.Ok - on to the game then . I am running a P3 500 which is well within the system requirements . I also have a 32MB video card . The offline practice mode takes no less than 3 minutes to load up . Unacceptable . In trying to map the controls I found that the game would not allow me to program my joystick . Unacceptable . As a ground troop my gun would not fire . In flight the sound would cut out intermittantly ( and no I was n't blacking or redding out ) . The graphics are horrible and low tech in comparison to other recent games . The interface is slow and clunky . I could go on but you get the point ( I hope ) .Wait until this game has time to mature into a proper peice of software - this release is nothing more than an incomplete beta version . Which is a shame because most beta software is free , while this cost me 40 bucks .	-1
I waited for this game since the very early planning stages ( about four years ago ) , participated in the developer chats , muddled through the website updates , was very active in the forum and community , and made several good friends which I still keep in touch to this day , even though we never played the game together . Why didnt we ? Cornered Rat Software ( CRS ) promised the world , and failed horribly.I could write a five-page essay on why this game deserves such a low rating , but since that will ust pile on the 'not helpful ' reviews , I will keep it to a couple paragraphs.The game WILL NEVER be complete . CRS has chosen to do 'map updates ' which erase everything that happened every so often which leaves neither side unable to win , and this is not a big fun FPS , it is nothing more then capture the flag on a large scale.The graphics and sound are abysmal to state it very plainly . It looks like this could be played on a Playstation or Nintendo 64 , but wait , there is more . In spite of the terrible graphics and cartidrige-quality sound , you need a monster system to play this on 512mb RAM will let you fly planes . I understand that in a MMOLG you need to make sacrifices , but not on a scale like this.Ill stop now , there have been constant updates and patches , and I have tried so hard to like this game , but it is nothing that was orignally promised . The sinister backstory behind its ' release is another review upon itself . All I can say is stay away for a year and although everything will be severly out f date , by that time this game might just be what they orignally promised it would.The only reason I gave it we must wait and see what happens in a year or so , but I am not keeping my fingers crossed , and am having a blast with Ghost Recon online .	-1
Creators need to lay off that funny tasing water ( not tasting ) .Evidently in my view they decided to try to made this look good for some green.i Bet im not making any sense ... ... ) ( to the point ) ( This game is way to short , I finished it in just 2 days times ( during the weekend ) .The campaign can also be very boring and it get very tiring intercepting mostly light mechs and it gets hard to get heavy mechs except the ones that become available about every 3 missions.Too many new mechs and not many of the old ones ... Dont know how they could leave out the Nova Cat ... Needs a little work yet.Unlike other games such as Force commander and Ages of Empire and MechCommander now when theres a lag spike and u click somwhere when that lag spike is over it doesnt count your click ... The light mechs need more room for more weapons i know they are light mechs but they need more than only like 3 lasers and 1 lrm . ) ( to the good things ) ( Over all the game completely blows in single player.However , the multiplayer allows very active play and all mechs more availabilitys more maps.Mostly all the good there is.Very good 3D graphics and the Artillary is ok too ... ) ( few more bad things ) ( I would be so much happier if this game had a instant action.This is one of those games that are made for instant action but this has none.Kinda untalented ... Almost all the games from the Mech Warrior series have had a instant action.Really strange that this one doesnt ... ) ( the end im off to play MechCommander and MechWarrior4 and MW3 ... Far away from the good rating of a must buy.Dont buy ! & lt ; BR ...	-1
I would like to be able to write a review for Mech Commander 2 , but I am unable to play this game on any computer in my house . It seems that Microsoft has chosen to add a copy-protect program -- & quot ; SafeDisc & quot ; -- to render the CD-ROM incompatible with every single drive I have . A readme file included with Mech Commander warns the user of this problem , when it is too late.Unfortunately , Microsoft neither includes a warning on the box , nor posts a list of incompatible drives on the Web -- as of this writing . Those who have not yet purchased Mech Commander 2 should be aware that , among many other drives , the CD-ROM fails with the following : Sony CDU5211 , Sony CDU77E , Acer CD-624a , Memorex CD-RW2224 , Plextor CD-ROM PX-32TS ( SCSI ) , Sanyo CRD-256P , and the Yamaha 2216E , 4416SX , and CDR6416S-VK . The full list is probably much longer . Microsoft does indicate that the Sony CDU77E should work if it is configured as a master drive , but all of the others listed are right out.I am personally going to contact Mircosoft about getting a replacement disc . I suspect a patch will not arrive , since this is a hardware issue , and Microsoft obviously will not do anything to override a system they just spent money to install and distribute . It may behoove the reader to write Microsoft for a full list of incompatible drives .	-1
What a disappointment . After 2 years of waiting , I finally get to play it , expecting another masterpiece from Chris Taylor . Instead , I get this pretty dungeon hack . Boo ! Even Diablo 2 had a story in there , somewhere .	-1
I bought this in a moment of weakness when there were no new first person D & D ; type games out there . I had been burned by other 3rd person games , but decided to see what someone else besides the Baldur 's Gate people could do with things.The game was very linear and to me , very annoying to play . I had problems with the party AI and did not like that I could not veer off the path to any extent . I got maybe halfway through it and quit . Not my cup of tea .	-1
Not only is this game linear , dumb-downed and boring , but its graphics leave something to be desired.I dl 'd the demo just to check it out and was highly disappointed.I recomend Neverwinter Nights for the fan of any RPG of high merit .	-1
Do n't let anyone fool you . This game is a pure 1 dimensional dungeon crawl of epic boredom.Your first impression upon starting the game is that it really is fun , and the graphics are good , and the gameplay is nicely paced . It was based on those same sentiments that my friends got me to buy it after they had been playing it for 2 days.Sadly , I did buy it . By the time I had it installed , most of them were complaining that it was getting repetitive and that there was n't much to it . Just gather up your NPC 's and keep going , boy ! Really , this is a game where if you buy enough healing/mana potions , you can survive anything , since your npc 's will drink for themselves , and if you get one of the healers with the group heal spell , you can kill for hours without taking a breather , if the mobs would hold out that long.Needless to say , I was finished with the game after a week , and looking for some poor sap to unload it on , because there is no replay value . You ca n't make different decisions , so its a one shot deal.Stay away !	-1
I would like to write more , but the game just put me to sleep ... Go buy some grass seed , plant it , watch it grow ... much more fun then this game ...	-1
Only two things separate this game from the pack , really.1 : The score . The music in this game really adds to the immersion of the game . This , I suppose , does n't mean all that much , since the immersion is not very compelling , but without the music it would be abysmal.2 : Graphics . DS is head and shoulders above Diablo 2 and Baldur 's Gate ( the two games it is most frequently compared to ) .Another review on this site says something to the effect of & quot ; this game plays itself. & quot ; I agree . Honestly , the only enjoyment I have gotten from it is listening to the music as my beautifully rendered character walks around a beautifully rendered landscape.Trust me , though ... that gets old quick , even with graphics and music as engaging as DS's.My advice : Wait for NWN or Morrowind .	-1
This is is a game from a LONG line of diablo clones . The basics of the game are just a rip-off from the diablo system . The only significant difference is the addition of quite good graphics.Unfortunatly this is one of the most uninteresting games i 've ever played . I pretty much exclusivly play rpgs and i was just totally bored about 10 minutes into this game . The plot is pretty much just meeting some schmuck on the road and he tells you something to do , so you go do it , and kill things along the way . I mean come on ... that was pretty fun at first but after Diablo , Diablo 2 , and the numerous clones they spawned ; that sort of thing has kind of gotten old.You can only play as a human character and theres very few modifications you can do to your characters looks ( and all of those modifications are abhorantly cheesy looking ) .The advancement system is pretty simple , and i think thats why its boring . If you want you character to be good in melee weapons ; then you smash things with a sword . Want an archer ? shoot things with a bow then . Want character who can smash and shoot ? then smash things with a sword half of the time and shoot with a bow the other half.But the thing that really made me hate this game was the camera angles . They jammed so many stupid trees and caves and mountains into the screen that you cant see ANYTHING . you have to spend about a minute moving your camera around before you can see anything , giving yourself an epileptic seizure in the process . I found it easist just to play the game completly in the `` mega-map '' mode . In that mode all the silly graphics dont get into your way and you can actually see where you 're going . But of course in the map mode you reduce the game to commanding a dot around and telling it to kill things.The game did suprise me on how smoothly it ran . Usually microsoft games give me alot of trouble with choppy graphics and game crashes . But this one never crashed and was plesently smooth and fast . Figures that the only game they make the runs smooth is the one i 'm not interesting in playing ... All in all if you 're up for a diablo clone i 'd recommend throne of darkness , forget about this waste of 1 gigabyte . On the up side it may make a good game for children ...	-1
READ THIS REVIEW IT IS VERY HELPFULMy friend got this game and he was saying stuff & quot ; you got ta get it , its so cool & quot ; I was so exited to get EQ trilogy . Finally I saved up enough money to pay for it for a few months . By the way thats a badthing , you have to pay $ 13 a monthly fee to play . Finally I started to play it and that weeks I played it every day . day 1 , awesome.. day 2 , awesome.. day 3 , awesome , day 4 5 and 6 , awesome ... day 7 , SUCKED ! after a few days of playing it , not only it gets old , but you learn your way around the game and figure out that its really dissapointing . The graphics are pretty good . but thats about the only good part . its impossible to gain levels , it takes so long . After 5 days of gameplay , 3 hours each of nothing but fighting , training , fighting , training I was level 4 . I didnt take one break , not a lunch break , NOTHING . Thats how hard it is . I didnt die once either . It is hard to find your way around . the 7th day before I got rid of it , it took me an hour to find the magic shop where you buy new spells to use . it is hard to use some spells , like hide . it never works . not many people are friendly . I only joined a group 1 time and that was with a friend my friend who I knew in real life . Even in the daytime , it seems kind of like it is still dark . It just barely lightens up . It is still about the same . You need a torch which doesnt help much . you can turn up your gamma and it will be easy to see but it will be like that the whole time even at night so it takes away the fun . It takes forever to get enough money to buy stuff unless you do a trade skill which is hard . It is nothing like the commercials , they say you go on challenging quests , fight dragons and other monsters , go on an adventure of a lifetime ! YOUR KIDDING RIGHT ? For crying out loud You have to stay in the same town until you are like level 20 which takes about a year , if youll leave in half a minute some monster will kill you . I can go on and on but I am getting tired.SO ... ... DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IT IS HORRIBLE ! ! ! ! ! WAIST OF MONEY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! WAIST OF TIME ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
This game is really annoying and can remind you of not the cool fantasy with adventure , but the little pink fairy magic that you see in the forest . Gosh , why do people like this game so much ? Im not even giving a review , because If you get it , youll cancel the subscription the next month like I did . Look at screenshots and itll tell you.The pictures lie , its a trick , dont listen to them ! If you want adventure like that , youll have to be playing till your an old man . Get Final fantasy XI , or Dark age of camelot or something .	-1
Yeah , this game is fun . Sure its fun when you start out . You think its a whole new world ahead of you ... but its not . I cancelled the subscription to this game after about a month . You can have up to 8 characters , and they can be any class and race you wish . There are ogres , humans , elves , etc . And their classes are things like wizards , warriors , rogues , and that . It will really remind you of mythology because of their spells and stuff.Its what people always do , they train and gain a few levels and get some cash from their enemy . Then they go buy some new weapons/armour/potions . They train till a certain level so they know they will be good enough to go out far through the everquest world . Sure , they are strong enough but they expected more . Tons of cool abilities and/or spells and items that makes it look cool like you see on trailers . But they dont get it . They train and train and accomplish nothing just like some other people are saying . Thats why I got rid of it.If you want a good fun , action/adventure online RPG that is way more fun , then I 'd suggest // Dark Age of Camelot \\ I have that game and it is what I expected . Its what I call *fun* ._ .	-1
To the Aussie who was a little bit rude : if the game is n't out yet , how can you say it 's gon na be good if the game is n't out yet ? If a game like FOCOM was a lemon , and it has all the big anticipation like GBG , why should I write good things about a game similar to FOCOM ? FOCOM has a problem with compatibility with video/sounds cards , it has nothing to do with the specs of any PC , that 's why everybody hated FOCOM . Try to understand first and then criticize about spelling , 'mateTo the others : Yes , I have n't played the game , but is sad that a great company like LucasArts can not come up with something better than AOE2 , perhaps when the game arrives , then all reviews would be valid or not ... we shall see ...	-1
This game does n't make much sense in terms of the Star Wars universe . It was clearly made to be as similar to Age of Kings as possible . Yeah , it 's pretty cool to select some Tie Fighters and tell them to attack , or to move around an At-At , but I 'm sorry , Wookies , Naboo and Gungans are all lame . It suffers from all the same problems as Age Of Kings : - Really really slow action , where everything takes forever- Sound is really bad . It sounds sample from someone 's VHS copy of Star Wars- Missions are boring- Too many units- So many resources that you spend all your time making drones to chop down trees.Additionally : - The graphics are sub-par . The color palletes for things are not right and there 's a lot of dithering . It looks really bad.- Each & quot ; race & quot ; is essentially exactly the same as the others . All have basically the same units and tech , with minor differences to make it appear that they & quot ; balanced & quot ; the game.Do not buy this .	-1
this games sucks..the controls r radically hard lol radically ..you need 2 memorize like 30 different buttons 2 run , jump , crouch this n that ..im on a laptop so ..it probably made it suck on ly more lol ..honestly id rather master the kotor like 20times b4 going threw this thing	-1
All I have to say bout this game is that it is fun for a couple hours once you get your lightsaber . There are some fun levels and special effects are great but ... . now the con- no real replayability , once I finished it , which did n't take too long , I did n't want to play it again , and the multiplayer is n't much better than the first jedi game ... I recommend waiting for Knights of the old republic to come out if you really want to lightsaber duel . Also Star Wars Galaxies is coming out in January and will be a great online RPG- with space wars and light saber battles .	-1
LucasArts STOLE MY MONEY ! this is one of the worst games i 've bought in 4 years . Although the graphics may be fancy thats about it . The game play is terrible , the levels are dry , and the animations are choppy ( even on my P4 256ram ! ! ! ! ) . Its like the only thing they focused on was pretty still pictures to lure unsuspecting gamers with screan shots . This game is JUST NOT FUN ! In addition to these problems there are hundreds of bugs in this version . I believe that they released this game way to early and I would not buy this product ! Save your money and please stop supporting everything they stamp a star wars logo on ! STARWARS stamped across the box can not justify such a terrible game .	-1
& quot ; Jedi Outcast & quot ; is the third installment in the outstanding & quot ; Dark Forces & quot ; series . Sadly , it is also the first misfire . & quot ; Dark Forces & quot ; and & quot ; Dark Forces 2 : Jedi Knight & quot ; were superb games both in terms of graphics , gameplay , and story arc . Admittedly , the graphics are good for & quot ; Jedi Outcast & quot ; , but it fails miserably with gameplay . The keyboard plays a singularly important role in any PC-based video game . With that being fact , it 's imperative that actions that keyboards performs be smooth and fluid . It was with the two previous installments in this series , but the control is nothing short of totally aggravating . The movement is 'herky-jerky ' , almost like it regressed to earlier technology . Aiming the weapons at the targets is nearly impossible because the targets move too fast to acquire with the current setup . Also , trying to pan the player 's view up and down and from left to right is very shaky . The gameplay is so awful that I have been forced to stop playing the game because I do not have the patience to deal with it . I suspect the game , itself , may actually get quite good . Unfortunately , I can not give a rating based on how good I think the game could be if only the gameplay were better . The fact that the game is too aggravating to continue to play dooms & quot ; Jedi Outcast & quot ; to the lowest score possible . Perhaps the versions ported for actual gaming systems perform much better . If they do , I will review this game much more favorably for that platform .	-1
I guess the first thing i 'll say is that I got Jedi Academy BEFORE I got this game . I was HUGELY dissaponted . I really liked Jedi Academy but this game is not that great . I have cheat codes so I can have all wepons and all amo and I can be undying . There are partes in this game that are INSAINLY tought . There are way to many puzzles - I do n't mind puzzles but there are simply way to many . And some on them are insainly hard . I would recomend you to get Jedi Knight : Jedi Academy - way better the puzzles are n't insain and you get to choose what you look like and ... .well I could go on but i 'll leave it there . If you aredy have Jedi Academy and you want another star wars game that is $ 20 then you sould get Battlefront thats anoter great game . Just do n't get this game .	-1
This game started off quite well . But it has flaws that just detracts from the game so much . A serious lack in the ease of finding the plot . After a while it can be tricky to have any idea what the character is meant to be doing . Alot of rpg 's spoon feed the plot . This ones becomes so hidden that you are left wondering what is the point . The graphics are ok , but the repetative use of graphics makes the game not only harder to navigate but also visually dull . It just lacks deapth and interest . Interesting characters like rummy just are not in it enough . There are better rpg 's out there and there will be better ones for the PS2 coming .	-1
Why is it that every time a new game system comes out ( in this case , the mighty PS2 ) , companies flood the market with poor games , sometimes with graphics which would be a letdown on an OLDER machine , sometimes with gameplay that will put a razor to your wrist , and sometimes games that just out and out suck on all fronts ? While Ephemeral Fantasia may not be the worst game ever made , it is certainly a disappointment , especially when one considers the fact that it was released by Konami . I tried , I mean , I REALLY tried to get into this game , but it is just horrible . Yeah , the minigames are fun ( hey , I gave it 2 stars ) , but please , PLEASE steer clear of this travesty of an RPG . I want my money back ...	-1
My head is pounding.Could the plucktastic sound track composed by zamfir and his mighty flutepeckers be the cause ? Or might it be the tepid time traveling plot that is causing my neck muscles to contort in vulcan death grip style ? I think it might be the horrid translation that is not only lacking strength and integrity , but is also filled with grammatical pitfalls carl lewis could n't jump.Where 's my aspirin ? The mini games and such are nice distractions from the rudimentary battle system , and some incorporate the use of Konami 's Guitar Freaks controller , only available as an import.But the scale of the town maps and the repetitive graphics make navigating around the map a laborious chore.And wait til you get into fisticuffs with the enemy.It looks like they spent about seven polygons on the whole works , making EF look like a high res Aidyn Chronicles.The best thing about the game is the triangle button which throws the game into fast forward.It 's light hearted fare , which is a relief from the usual D and D but this is not a very good RPG .	-1
When I looked at the cover , I was convinced that this is a good game . Indeed , this game delivered a solid RPG gameplay . However , as I compared it to FFX , this game was lacking . It has no characters vocal , no point of destination , and the game repeated for several times.The graphics was not so good , which made me lost my interest in playing this game until the end . The monsters were not as unique as other RPG games.It 's really fun to play a musical instrument ( a guitar ) . I get hooked by the mini games . Although it has a variety of songs , it only based on one song . The last song that Mouse should performed to Xelpherpolis was so difficult . The rhytm was so fast.Seriously , this game needed some modifications before it was released to the market . I hoped Konami will remake this game^O^.Please rent this game before you buy it . If you 're satisfied , then purchased it later .	-1
how could they of ruined Atari ? well they did . controls messed up and cant play for ******** so I do n't like it	-1
InterAct have recently replaced the GameShark2 v2 with a new GameShark2 v3 . The codes for the v3 are incompatible with the v2 codes , and vice versa . InterAct are no longer publishing v2 codes for current games . You can buy an upgrade to GameShark2 v3 , but you have to send back your v2 CD ... meaning you 're without the codes for your older games . So it looks like InterAct wants to try and push people to go out and buy a whole new GameShark2 v3 , so they get more cash.Meanwhile , [ ... ] has codes for GameShark2 v2 , which was actually the Action Replay unit under a different name . So rather than being forced to pay InterAct for a v3 upgrade , go there instead !	-1
If you can , find another cheat device . Eighty percent of the people I have talked to ( 500 people or so ) have said their 's lasted a max of four months and then had a fatal glitch . Mine lasted a little over three . The gameshark deleted 90 % of my codes and garbled the other 10 % . To top it off I ca n't even reload them because of a & quot ; Hardware not detected & quot ; error . THIS IS COMMON AND CA N'T BE AVOIDED . It 's a piece of junk . I 'm looking into the Pelican code breaker mentioned by one of the other reviewers . It has to be better than this . Save your money or buy something else .	-1
This has to be the most important review for this system because it will help you decide if the PS2 is right for you . I brought mine back in November 2001 & it started malfunctioning in January . ( ONLY AFTER 2 MONTHS ! ? ! ? ) Now I 'm not sure it it 's my fault or sony 's human error . On their part the diagnonsis function does NOT work & in my opinion I found it to have no function . What I did was buy the already upgraded gameshark 1.9 on an auction website & it started messing up after that . Besides that , Gameshark.com aka interact accs . tells up to use only their codes in which I did , I have n't used any codes out side gameshark.com.Some of their codes do NOT work but they self-rightously claim that their codes work 100 % . I even told them that I triple check codes for validity ! With my 1.4 version PS1 gameshark brought in March 1997 & upgraded to 3.2 in November 1998- My 1997 Playstation 1 lasted for 2 years ( Until July 1999 ) before I got the 1999 version which lasted for another 2 years ! ! ( Until August 2001 ) I think that this is sony 's FK up as they built the Playstation 2 to resist the gameshark . Let me just say that as long as there are video game systems that there will also be gamesharks , but there should NOT be intentional malfuntions to snatch more $ $ from the average consumer ! Oh , but wait ! Currently my playstation 2 still does play the regular blue disks but not the silver dvd roms or dvd movies ! -This has been many dollars for my thoughts.. not including the other games that I brought & do not work . Sony should just drop the price of the console already because the original price was not worth it !	-1
Let me just say this once ... RIP OFF ! Games can be hard at some points , and its sometimes hard to get the most coolest weapons , items , etc . Well , O.K . but , thats why there are strategy guides . Gameshark gave me alot of codes to get my HP and MP higher , also weapons , items , and I finally killed Evrae on Final Fantasy 10 . But listen to this , I had this game shark for about 5 to 6 months and yeah that does seem along time but ... 1 . ) I put the gameshark disc into the PS22 . ) It started to load ... then said DISC READ ERRORAfter that I took the disc , cleaned it and the PS2 but still did n't work after that.SAVE YOU MULA ON SOMETHING ELSE THAT W O R K S for your lifetime ! Oh , excuse me I left something else ... it ERASED my important battle skills and my peoples HP . And when I tried to beat this one boss , it had more HP then its suppose to be . Like the bosses HP was suppose to be 100,000 when it turned the HP into MAYBE atleast a million !	-1
First , if you have the old playstation 2 ( not slim and without the network built in ) do n't buy ! ! ! The disc is undersized compared to a regular disc . You will spend hours attempting to get the disc to read because it has to be placed `` just right in the reader . `` Next , the discs are blue on the bottom and are so delicate if you even think about a scratch , you will have one . And finally , the gameshark website takes 2-5 weeks to update codes for new games.When it works and you have the codes , its great . But that is few and far between sessions .	-1
Just purchased this thing a few hours ago . I have yet to see it work . It 's going back to the store .	-1
I have to say , since I have a Hih version PS2 , my gameshark works well all the time , but hears the main flaw , I have a gameshark 2 , and codes for the games I want only work on gameshark 3 ! Games like Splinter Cell ( Which I really need codes for , badly ) , Xenosaga ( So I can play it again , and have no trouble ) , and a lot of other games . This is major BS ! ! I brought this in december , now it 's like a useless piece of garbage ! Why ca n't I upgrade this or something ? ! Well one things for sure , I 'm not spending another 40 bux for another gameshark , just to play my new games . I 'd rather beat it on my own . If you do n't have a gameshark , and need one , get version3 , but then they 'll screw you over in the future when version 4 comes out . Interact is just too greedy for their own good . Well , their not getting their grubby hands on my money for a long time , or maybe never .	-1
I hav n't had much problems , but on the side that you have a 50 % chance of it not working , Wait ... there is a word for that , It 's called a SCAM ! You ca n't enter your own codes for the PS1 disc you have to buy a stupid upgrade disc that does n't even have the codes you want ! For example I have a code for Spyro the dragon to `` Fly instead of glide '' now I ca n't get that on my PS2 now can I ? ! ? ! ? because I ca n't enter it in or get it on the upgrade disc ! Save your PS1 GS it is 100 times better !	-1
So far I had 2 gamesharks , both of which were defective . However , I was lucky enough and my PS2 di n't mess up , but if you do use this [ terrible ] peripheral you 'll probably end up buying a new PS2.As far as the product itself it 's ok , but it will mess up soon enough . So , if you want a cheating device , I 'd suggest code breaker , it 's better and has a better ( and wider ) variety of cheats , and if you ca n't find a cheat for that use one for the gameshark , and it will work ! I am very dissapointed in Interact , I lost all faith in them ... .If you already have a gameshark go get your receipt and hold on to it , and when it breaks take your money back and go get the Codebreaker .	-1
If you still have & quot ; Pac Man Fever & quot ; check out NamcoMuseum for the GBA . It has Ms. Pac Man , and many other games which put these to shame . As someone who works in video games , I never heard so many complaints about a game , as I did this one ( i.e . - too difficult , too boring etc )	-1
Final Fantasy IV works fine and the load times are n't a problem . However the load times for Chrono Trigger are unacceptable . It takes like 15 seconds to open the menu and start a battle once engaged . This game was made solely to make money , and you can see that in the quality of Chrono Trigger . They rushed the game and did n't even bother to check and make sure the game worked properly before sending it out . The load times made Chrono Trigger virtually unplayable . I ended up playing it on an snes instead . If I dread battles and avoid opening the menu because the load times are super long , then the experience is ruined . The same problem ( though not as severe ) happened with Final Fantasy Anthology . FF6 had terrible load times . Square did n't take the time to work out the kinks . Even though its been many years since the release of this game . I think square should offer refunds for anyone who bought it .	-1
Now , I 'm just about the biggest Final Fantasy fan around , but FF4 is just nothing compared to FF7 . FF4 does n't have anything in it that can match the horror of when AERIS DIES ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! And man , that Chrono Trigger game . What 's the deal with that ? That is n't even Final Fantasy at all , just like the FF Movie . Chrono Trigger was incredibly boring , and I was displeased with its lack of random encounters . And it should have had cool characters , like Cloud , and Aeris , and Barret , and Wedge , and Tifa . They were great .	-1
PSO is a great game , my friend brought it over and it 's incredibly customizable and fun to play , if you want a game to brainwash you into playing more and more and more , this is your game . However i 'd advise against the version 2 very very strongly , you have to give Seganet your credit card number to play this and it costs like 24 bucks a month or something for a few extra levels . However PSO is a very very good game and you can head out today and buy PSO and a keyboard for 45 bucks and never pay a cent . It 's kind of a no brainer unless you live , eat , sleep , bleed , sweat , etc ... PSO .	-1
That 's right to play this game online you have to pay ! My friends and I being hardcore Sega fans are very disappointed . You already have to pay 40 bucks for the game . In this version there is only new items and new levels no new characters . I would recommend purchasing the first one it is very good and you dont have to pay to play online . I also recommend Sonic Adventure 2 it is way fun the best sonic game ever .	-1
If you like this game you stand alone , I was angered with this game for a few reasons . First they kill the story of phantasy star , and it does not have the enjoyment feel of the older ones . Secondly , it just isnt fun you flay the same levels over and over again . Eat the same food over and over again and eventually you cant take it anymore . Thats how it made me feel .	-1
I bought this knowing that the servers would no longer be up . I figured i would just play the single player mode in the game . However you still need to link the game with your system and if you buy it used it will not come with the code needed and will be unplayable	-1
I have to be honest I hate childish games , they are so annoying and sometimes too cute for me . But this game is some what fun there is nothing really to unlock just to play the game and finish it.I only play it because I am just so damn bored . This game is only good for girls or boys that are below the age of 11 , well that is what I think I really do n't care if you buy it or not I am just saying think twice before u waste your money you might regret it later on . It 's an alright game .	-1
This product was not usable or even helpful . It glitched many of my Nintendo 64 games and caused my system to corrupt itself . It was nothing what the reviews I had read said it was . I am not pleased with this product nor will I re-purchase it .	-1
They said it was in Good condition , thats what i was hoping for until i put the card into my controller to save my game for 007 World is Not Enough and it said `` Controller Pak may be damaged or broken '' well it was ! I am not happy at all about this product and will never buy from this person/company again !	-1
Popped it into my N64 and tried to use it . Was immediately taken to a screen telling me that the memory card was broken and would not work . Gunna try getting another memory card like this brand new hopefully that one works as I need a memory card in order to play Turok Rage wars	-1
The momory card I received was NOT the one pictured . I received a generic knock off product . My PS1 did not even recognize it as a memory card . Beware ! Amazon are you reading this ? I hope so .	-1
well the cord is alright but i didnt know that kind of cord went to a playstation 2 .	-1
Component video cables for the PS2 are supposed to be hooked up to TVs that have Y Cb/Pb Cr/Pr connections . Many newer TVs ( like the ones I have ) have Y Pb Pr connections . They LOOK the same . The manuals say that they 're for component video . But there is one crucial difference . The Y Cb/Pb Cr/Pr PS2 video output does n't work in a Y Pb Pr TV ! They mention this in the fine print of the PS2 manual but , as I found to my sorrow , it 's easy to overlook.Before you buy this ( or any other ) component video cable to hook your PS2 up with your HDTV check the connections on the HDTV . If it 's Y Pb Pr it probably wo n't work.Just to be clear , I DID change the video output of the PS2 from RGB to Y Cb/Pb Cr/Pr before connecting the cable to the TV . Did not work ( on two different HDTVs that have Y Pb Pr connections ) The cable itself does n't deserve a `` 1 '' rating . I 'm almost sure that if you have a HDTV with Y Cb/Pb Cr/Pr connections you 'll love this cable . I just wish I could test it myself ... -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Update 12/2/2009 -- -- -- -- -- If you ca n't use component cables , S-Video works pretty well . You 're much better off with S-Video than composite !	-1
I got this for my ps2 and i tried to connect it to my tv and it did n't show anything .	-1
Was n't compatible with my tv so I sent it back and got a s-video . Not sure what the problem is . Seems to work well for others ... . Not sure ... I ca n't offer a good review on this one ... sorry !	-1
I got the new Component AV cable . The plug part that goes into the PS2 did not fit snug.Didnt spend over 5.00 for it , but if i had to do it over again I would have went to Radio shack to get the SONY BRAND . If you ever have to send in your SONY PS 2 make sure you use SONY BRAND PARTS /CABLES ( anything really ) . If you use this part your WARRANTY is not worth the paper it is printed on . Check out Playstation FAQs at their website .	-1
I purchased this cable to replace my standard RGB hookup for my PS2 . At first I simply noticed no significant picture improvement ( yes , I did switch my PS2 settings from RGB to component as others have indicated ) . Even so , I was n't willing to waste time returning it and going back to RGB.After several days , however , I expirienced a disturbing tendency for my picture to black out for a few seconds every time my HVAC unit started or stopped . I was able to consistantly reproduce the video loss by toggling my A/C on and off.After losing more than one game due to loss of video , I ordered the slightly more expensive component cable manufactured by Sony for PS2/PS3 . After installing the Sony-manufactured cables I 've noticed a significant improvement in picture quality and no longer get video cut-out when my A/C kicks on.Bottom line : While many may not experience any issues depending on where their PS2 is located in relation to their appliances , this product is a gamble . Also , since the purchase price is low in relation to the shipping cost there is little reason to return it for a refund unless the seller offers to pay refund shipping .	-1
Stopped working after about 6 months.How do A/V cables stop working when you plug them in and dont touch them ? ! ? I can understand them wearing out if their being plugged in and unplugged constantly , but to just stop working ? Cheap .99 cent store quality.I guess you get what you pay for .	-1
I bought these cables thinking they would improve the picture quality of the PS2 while playing on my HDTV . Purple and green colored lines go through the picture and the colors are way off when playing video games and watching DVD 's on the PS2 when using this cable . I guess for the price one can not expect much from this company . I have already ordered an official Sony component cable to replace this garbage . If you want quality then go for either Monster or an official Sony component cable if you want to improve picture quality of your PS2 gaming and movie watching experience . This company should not even be able to shovel out crap like this to people !	-1
Does n't work for Y Pb Pr TVs like the other reviewer mentioned . My TV is new from 2009 , I do n't know why they would n't make compatible cables for recent TVs ! ! It shows the Playstation logo on the screen and then the picture freezes . Not recommended	-1
I tried to save a few bucks but fell into the same trap Arthur Kimes did on his review , this cable will not work on a Y/Pb/Pr HDTV , it kept bouncing back and forth from a messed up picture to `` this signal mode is not supported '' even after setting the PS2 menu to the correct component configuration instead of RGB.Stick to the official Sony Brand cables , Do not buy this .	-1
I tried it with my HD tv and change the settings but the television kept going black from time to time	-1
I got this item because the cable for my PS2 was loose and would not stay in . Now to it 's credit , the sound was great ! However ... .3 of the five plugs did not work properly . The video cable only put out black and white . No color . Two of the sound cables did not work at all . The two sound cables that did work , sounded great.So , basically , it was a waste of money . to make matters worse and this has nothing to do with the product ) the seller refused to respond to my repeated attempts at contact ... .Not happy at all with this product .	-1
Thought I could get away with buying component cables this cheap for my ps2 , I guess I got what I paid for . Did n't work at all , nor video or sound , when plugged into my tv , and another tv . I made sure the options were set right on the ps2/tv.I 'll attempt to find out what is wrong with it and fix it , but it is n't worth the refund because of the shipping fee.Not really too much of a loss though all in all	-1
Ok , since I 'm an adult my view on this game is likely very biased . While the first ten minutes of gameplay was fun , I soon beat most of the tracks ( with Peach ) and it just became boring . I can imagine this could be a good game for kids : driving and shooting and throwing bananas ... And there are 20 tracks to choose from ( 16 of which are available right away ) . Unfortunately there appear to be a few bugs with the software that can frustrate the player . In the end , I regretted paying ( ... ) for a game that I wo n't touch again .	-1
Mario Kart Super Circuit for Game Boy Advance is best compared to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System ( SNES ) counterpart . If you began liking Mario Kart with the Nintendo 64 version , then the GBA version will not live up to your expectations . However , I have friends who prefer the SNES version ; so if you are one of those , consider the GBA version an upgrade from the SNES version.In the GBA version , the graphics are rather decent as compared to the SNES version . The GBA system is 32-bit ; and compared to the SNES ( 16-bit ) , there are more capabilities.Your perspective is behind the racer , and the graphics flow smoothly all around your driver with a great 3D-like perspective . The levels are quite nice , and the drivers and graphics are well-detailed.The gameplay is a lot like the SNES version where hopping does n't help you very much ( it helps a LOT in MK64 ! ) , but it surely upgrades the item usage . That is , you can line your shells up much better , and negotiating turns is much easier.The action involved in the game is complimented with the Gran Prix mode where you can win tournaments . Linking up with others , in my opinion , is the best feature of the game , hands down.So if you like portability and you appreciate the SNES version of Mario Kart , this game will suit you nicely . Also , if you like to play Mario Kart by yourself , this game can burn some time for you . But if you started your Mario Kart career off with the N64 version like I did , then you will be slightly disappointed with some of the general gameplay capabilities . ( The GBA game plays nothing like the 64 version . )	-1
Do n't get me wrong ; I love Mario Kart ! However , you sometimes meet a terrible game in a series . Mario Kart : Super Circuit is obviously no fun IMO compared to Mario Kart 7 . I enjoyed Mario Kart Advance when I was younger , but now I think it 's just a gimmick to show off what the Game Boy Advance could do in 2001 . This game is OVERRATE just like ALL Zelda games after the Super NES announcement .	-1
I was a bit upset that the seller said that the label was clean and intact but in reality , it was worn out and torn . The game worked but it wasnt in the condition i hoped it to be . It feels like someone had this in the basement somewhere and thought they could sell it to someone for a cheap deal . They succeded .	-1
After playing Mario Kart 64 ( on the Nintendo 64 ) , I was very disappointed to see & quot ; Mario Kart Super Circuit & quot ; basically represent a step backwards in technology . Of course , I should have assumed this , since the GBA 's 32-bit processor is only half as powerful as the Nintendo 64's.This version of Mario Kart is really more similar to the Super NES game & quot ; Super Mario Kart , & quot ; which I never liked -- and I ca n't say I like this version much more . You 're back to the old mission of collecting coins as you race , and the coins have something to do with your speed and/or resistance to crashes . I never really saw any major difference on how many coins you have.In any event ... if you like Mario Kart 64 or the Gamecube 's Mario Kart Double Dash ... this game could let you down . It 's not & quot ; truly & quot ; a 3-D game . Because the GBA screen is so small , the action moves so fast , and the & quot ; fake 3D perspective & quot ; is mediocre ... it 's hard to anticipate upcoming turns and obstacles . I 've always thought the turning controls were way too touchy on this and the SNES version.I also think the computer characters cheat ... no matter how much of a good lead you can build at the beginning of a race , or how many speed mushrooms you use ... the computer players ALWAYS catch up !	-1
Dont buy this game ! It is horrible ! The cartoons look like an ages 2 and up board game . It is ditsy , dinky , and silly . Go buy a REAl strategy game . This stinks .	-1
All I have heard are good things about this game but that is not what I thought . If you really like war this will probably be one of your favorites , but if not it will get really repetitious . All you do is fight war after war after war . It got very boring very quick for me . The good point is that you can build your own maps to fight wars on but you can only store up to three .	-1
Ok so i 've had this for well about 2 weeks and idk somethin happend and all my stuff i had saved became corrupted and even after i cleared it , it just never stops corrupting data.This is one of those things where you feel good to save money but then you find out that it was n't worth the box it came in.I think it would be a good ideal to stay away from this and get the brand of the thing your gon na be puttin it in .	-1
I do n't know exactly why it is , but usually memory devices for game console made by 3rd-party manufacturers are inferior in quality . They are cheaper , of course . However , I experienced a couple times of complete data loss from 3rd-party memories from the time of PS1 . The situations were all the same : both 3rd-party and genuine memories were inserted to console all the time , yet only 3rd-party one failed.Not all 3rd-party memories will fail , of course . Even memories from same company show difference . However , since I have n't experienced data failure from genuine memories yet , I do recommend you to buy genuine memory , rather than to test your luck .	-1
I am a fan of the Survivor Series , but this game does n't do it justice though it 's not as bad as advertised . You have your choice of which tribe you want to be and which tribe you want to play against . You can either play as one of the Survivors from the TV show or you can make your own custom character . When the game starts , you see some pretty good shots that are from the TV show and you see the real characters when they go fo mail and stuff like that . But then the game gets a little tough too swallow . You have around 3 1/2 to 4 minutes to & quot ; talk & quot ; to the other characters . It 's basically the same questions over and over . Then you have the reward challenge . Some of the challenges are Ok , but most are just stupid . After that , then you go back to & quot ; talking & quot ; again . Then you do the immunity challenge . If you lose , you vote someone off . There is no way to speed up any of these processes . You have to suffer through some very tedious and boring aspects of this game . The graphics of the characters and of the landscape around you are n't very good and the AI ( artificial intelligence ) in the game is horrible . I had 3 people in my tribe that I gave weak emotional energy to and talked bad about them and they still thought we had an alliance . A tribe member will say that you should watch yourself and you ask what have you heard and they say not much . That 's it . And during the challenges , you ca n't even see what the other tribe scored or how close to winning they are in most of them . And the internet play , you might as well forget it . I thought it would be fun to play over the internet but because the game does n't have anyone supporting it , it 's nearly impossible find anyone playing it . Now , this game is n't a total waste as it was amusing for a short time and the price is respectable , but they should 've put this game together alot better than they did . I 'm dissapointed , but at least it amused me for a few hours .	-1
I ca n't emphasize that enough-EVEN A DIEHARD SURVIVOR FAN WILL NOT ENJOY THIS GAME ! I was severely disappointed . Loving Survivor , I expected the game to involve more strategy and conversation . This game could 've been a best seller , but Wizard Works blew it.First of all , the game is poorly put together . After about 5 hours of gameplay -- 4 of those 5 hours in which I was bored , the game broke . I have a new computer Windows 2000 and I was really mad that I spent [ money ] on this game and it broke within a few days . It would n't load the game up . Now I 'm going to give you my reasons for buying and not buying this game . Poor Graphics . The Conversations with other teamates are bland and the other computer-played characters respond with the same strange responses over and over . It is IMPOSSIBLE to hold an understandible coversation with them ! The Voting system is hard to understand.The reward/immunity challenges are always the same bland , old thing . If you win a reward challenge , the reward is the same . Voting out another person and winning is fun for about -- an hour.To conclude , this game turned to be nothing to talk about.Coming from a simulation game LOVER and one who has a fascination with Survivor , do n't get this game .	-1
... The Ai is like a log . It has horrible challenges . The multiplayer ... Tribal council is lame . You ca n't even make alliances . I do n't get it , who would want this interactive ... Even hardcore survivor fans would n't want this piece ... Let 's hope markaysas is better . I mean Magic Lantern has like 20 developers . Do n't get it ! !	-1
... You ca n't start alliances they never listen ! They just randomly vote and say stuff ! ! ! ! The graphics are sooooooooooo poor ! It 's laughable ! Oh , and if you get voted off after the merge you do n't get to be in the jury ! You even play the same challenge VER and OVER again ! Youe ven do n't build shelter ! ! ! ! Here 's what you do Walk around and talk to people who randomly say stuff next reward challenge that does n't matter then immunity then tribal council . In tribal council you just vote . They do n't dramatize it , Jeff does n't ask you anything the CPU randomly vote ! I gave it a 2 because it 's so pathetic it 's funny ! I would reccomend this to canibalistic clouns , Party going monkeys and fools .	-1
Like many- I am a huge survivor fan and was very excited to get this game , but i was disappointed in the actual game play- there is too much repetition- in the mini games , dialogue etc . It is nice to revisit old fan favorites and play along using characters you already know..but be warned , this software has a bug that makes installtion hard and keeps kicking me out and onto the desk top..Take my advice , and vote this game out of the tribe ! ! Immediately	-1
Survivor has been one of my favorite television shows since it debuted nearly two years ago . The combination of physical survival and societal survival really appealed to me , and thought a computer game could be potentially awesome ... not this one ! When you start playing , you 're given the option to choose which edition of survivor to play , but the only one available is Australian Outback . Then , you choose how long of a game you want and who you want to be . Then you begin the `` survival period . '' You 're supposed to hurry to pick which task you want to do , but the computer does them all so there 's really no point to this at all . Instead , the point of survival period is to chat with your fellow survivors . Nevermind that the dialogue is derivative , stupid , repetitive , and sometimes downright full of non-sequiters . This is how you build alliances and get people voted off.Unfortunately , you have no way to influence your `` allies . '' One second they 'll tell you Colleen has got to go , and the next second they 'll vote Rudy off . You can tell them to please vote for Jenna , but they 'll vote for B.B . regardless . This really limits the fun factor when you 're just hoping they do n't feel like voting YOU off.Then , after a 3-minute survival period , you do a reward challenge . These will be dumb games like shooting arrows at boring targets , answering repetitive questions about the outback ( which reappear way too quickly ) , and stupid races where you click arrows to indicate effort and then click them down once your player begins to get fatigued . This is about the level of a 1982 arcade game , if that.Then , whoever wins gets a physical and mental boost , which makes you better in later reward challenges ( yay ) and more points to allocate toward other survivors . It 's here that you choose who you like and dislike . Nevermind that your ratings do n't have to match with someone else 's at all.After another survival period ( it 's at this point you 'll begin to realize all of the dialogue can be whipped through in two minutes , and you 're going to keep hearing `` I think I should take a breather '' for another 12 episodes ) you finally vote people off . After a long , boring , and dull video sequence , you finally vote whoever you want off . Of course , chances are half of the other people will vote someone else out of the tribe . Then , you get to do it all over again . Sound like fun ? No ? If you 're a fan of survivor , wait until it 's in the bargain bin ( [ amt ] ) , and if you 're not a fan , avoid this game like the plague .	-1
I am not one who writes a lot of bad reviews - I think I am fairly easy to please . I love playing computer games and I do n't need fancy graphics to make me happy . I am also a HUGE Survivor fan , so of course someone bought me this game as a gift when it came out.I played it for a few hours , and it was a complete waste of time . I can deal with the crappy graphics , but gameplay itself is just boring . You walk around camp and talk to people , but the conversations make absolutely no sense . The person will tell you they hate someone in one sentence , then the next sentence they will tell you you 're crazy for wanting to vote that same person off . The computer AI also seems to automatically go for you during the votes , no matter what . I played probably 30 different times and each time if I did n't win immunity , I got voted off first or second.The immunity challenges are somewhat fun , but there is very little variety so I got bored of them quickly . The voting is kind of fun , if you have immunity ! Otherwise , be prepared for a quick & quot ; Game Over ! & quot ; I can see how making a game of the show would be difficult - the entire show is about human relationships which are hard to adequately present in a computer game . Anyways , this game is a waste of money . It 's quite simply not FUN .	-1
It never worked for me on the 4 computers I tried it on . ( Windows 98 , ME , XP , and XP ) even when my computer lived up to all the specs on the box . A definite do not buy !	-1
Let me say I LOVE the Survivor TV show . So Infogrames or whatever the heck they call themselves released this game , I eagerly bought it . Too bad I did n't realize the game was fun for about five minutes . The computer is inconsistent , pathetic , dumb , and downright boring to talk to . The & quot ; challenges & quot ; are easy , boring , and quite bland . Even the screenshots are misleading . You see a screen with everyone sitting around the campfire . I never ONCE saw that in the game , and I got to after the merge . What B.S ! The advertisements are misleading- STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME ! Sorry Infogrames , you blew it .	-1
My wife is the `` Survivor '' freak and I got this game thinking it would get her involved with me and gamming ( and the price was right at the time ) . Well she played it for like 20 minutes and the game never came up in conversation again . What a bad idea . In hind sight , the game publisher should have paid me to play the game and think I would have thrown it back at them.AI is hard to get right in any game , but this game set a new standard in REALLY STUPID AI . While in camp mode , your supposed to walk around , conduct tasks , talk to tribe members and influence their decisions while making alliances . It never mattered what you did in camp , it made absolutly no difference in the rest of the game.The challenges were just too stupid and repetative to list . You could make it to the end of this game in one sitting because winning immunity was that easy.The graphics were terrible . The sound was terrible . Overall , just a terrible game . You will not surive this if you buy it .	-1
I am a long time Nintendo fan . Even now , when I have a Playstation 2 , and no Gamecube , I still like Nintendo more . So this review is not just a bias complaint about Nintendo vs. Playstation.This version of THPS2 is terrible . Oh , yeah , it 's tons of fun when you have n't played the Playstation version , but when you have , you realize just how pitifull this is . On PS , it 's rated T , because they do n't blurt out words like & quot ; hell & quot ; on songs . On Nintedno , It 's rated E , so the whole family can enjoy censored versions of songs by Powerman 5000 , Papa Roach & amp ; Rage Aganist the Machine . And another thing music wise : THEY DO N'T EVEN PLAY THE WHOLE SONG ! They cut out one of the choruses and the verses ( this is an example ) , and just let it go from there . And the track does n't go to the next track when it 's done ; it just plays over and over and over , to where you have to change it yourself every 3 listens . And it 's not just the music . There 's too much to say , so just play the PS version , PLEASE !	-1
It 's all over in a matter of minutes seriously . The game involves Spidey going out to buy Mary-Jane a fishbowl but he gets caught up in rumble downtown as several of his enemies run riot . It 's up to him to sort them out.In 7 very short levels the game is over . And you 'll be left with your jaw hanging open that a game can be so easy . The beat-em-up aspect of the game is pretty lame , all the bad guys look the same , the music is often bland , the level design is dated and the gameplay even less engaging than Spider-Man vs the Kingpin on the Sega Genesis 10 years previous.If you see this game on sale for a matter of pennies then go for it . Otherwise avoid ! Graphics CSound CGameplay CLasting Appeal D-	-1
this game is an old fashion side scrolling fighting game where the character is walking towards the left of the screen and several monsters are chargeing at you from the right . you are not allowed to proceed until you have beat all the monsters that are attacking you . but thats it . that is the extent of the game . you can fight one on one with someone else who has the game . also the characters stand and move much the same as they did in fighting games from the 80's.my copy ended in a used games store in less then 12 hours after i brought it.conisering the vast potention of GBA , this game is a waste of money . there are sever fighters like tekken that are out and much better )	-1
Of all the video games over the years that have ever graced the X-Men license , only a few have ever been anything above average . Activision ( which has done great things in video games with the Spider-Man license ) attempts to make a great X-Men game for the GBA , but the results are just below lackluster . You get to play as Wolverine , Cyclops , Storm , and Rogue and you go through each level taking out hordes of generic looking enemies . First off you 'll notice the fantastic looking graphics which are so fluidly animated they look like they were taken out of the comic , but longtime fans of anything X-Men will wonder why the developers decided to have Cyclops , Storm , and Rogue prance around in their older ( and let 's face it , lamer ) costumes , while those same fans will wonder why Cable is an enemy . Other bosses include Sabretooth , Blob , and eventually Apocalypse ; most of the bosses move around the same and you can use pretty much the same strategy to beat them . The controls are ok , but the formulatic & quot ; run from one side to the other while knocking out hordes of the same enemies without anything else to do & quot ; theme of the game will get more and more boring every time you play it . Instead of this game , I would have loved to see Konami 's old X-Men arcade beat 'em up ( it had Wolverine , Cyclops , Dazzler , Colossus , and a few others , and was actually fun ) brought to the GBA . All in all , this is worth a play or two if your a fan of anything X-Men , but other than that this game is rather shallow .	-1
I 've only played a few Gundam games in my life but this is definitely the worst . I 'll start with the positives . The story is true to the anime and the missions almost mirror the battles perfectly . The graphics are fairly decent for it 's time and are good enough . The features are pretty good and the difficulty level is tough but not impossible.Now for the bad parts . The game has a FAKE difficulty , by this I mean the controls are horrible and you will miss far more than you will hit anything unless your timing is perfect and you 've mastered the & # 34 ; claw & # 34 ; controller grip . Playing on a regular dualshock 2 is enough to cramp your wrist after an hour . The AI is also horrendous and your allies will do next to nothing besides run in circles taking pot-shots at flying enemies and they might have an accuracy rating of 10 % at best.The sad thing is that yours will be no better than 30 % unless you are very talented at video games and beyond that of your average online shooter player.Imagine yourself in the middle of a war and your given a gun that is fingerprint locked with 4 safeties and has to prime itself for a few seconds after every single shot and takes 5+ shots to kill anything . Then add enemies that fly in wide patterns and will rarely miss you , they also travel three times as fast as you to top it off.Your basically a dyslexic turtle being attacked by bats.I did manage to beat the game eventually but it certainly took more tries than I 'd care to admit . The first mission is the easiest thing ever but by the second you 'll be yelling at the screen .	-1
Code Veronica is hands down the most frustrating , pain-in-the-butt Resident Evil game in the entire series . The formula is the same , but the game is horribly imbalanced . If you do n't play through it in a very specific way , it is possible to reach a point where it literally becomes unplayable because you will run out of ammo . That alone is bad enough , but there are other elements in the gameplay design that were simply not well thought-out , and cause the player a supreme amount of frustration . For example , bats that will not leave you alone unless you have the lighter . If you make a certain decision at a certain point in the game , Claire gives up the lighter , leaving you with no defense against the bats . Then throw in the Bandersnatches , who have a completely unavoidable long range attack . You end up standing there , trying to fire your weapon as they pound on you . You 're simply trading blows with them , and that 's not good gameplay design . The puzzles too are more convoluted than in previous games , so you often end up wasting precious resources like ammo and herbs as you run from area to area trying to figure out what to do next . In Code Veronica , zombies regenerate after you 've left an area , something which did n't happen in previous RE games . So the more you run around , the more ammo you 're wasting , and the more your chances of being able to continue in the game dwindle . I 've enjoyed all of the Resident Evil games except this one . It 's the stinker of the bunch . Buyers beware !	-1
well , i loved RE2 and RE3 and i assumed this one would be just as good . Boy was i wrong . This is one of the worst games i have ever played . The graphics are improved , but the plot is just absolute excrement and the characters bite . the weapons are awful too and the controls seem much more difficult to manipulate . do n't waste your time or your money	-1
not sure if it was this one or the other one , order for my son , only had one disc was suppoed to have 2 , he rented from the library and it had 2	-1
A good story line and beautiful computer generated sequences can go a long way to making a game a winner , but horrible controls and bad camera angles can also go a long way towards making it a loser . Resident Evil Code : Veronica X balances out somewhere in the middle , and Capcom needs to cleanup the problems before it continues to go on to make another one in this series . There 's not much new from the previous games besides a storyline.On its good notes , the game does have a strong storyline with impressive cut scenes . It does a superb job of creating a creepy environment for you to play in . I usually play games late at night in the dark , but I honestly had to keep the lights on while playing this one to help tone down the spookiness of it . Entering rooms and hearing the moan of zombies that ca n't be scene ate away at my sanity.Unfortunately , this is one of the few games I did n't play through to the end . I rented it for a week , and have no intent to buy it or rent it again . The action was very slow paced throughout the game , and needed to be because of the horrible controls . Up walks forward and right and left turn . That 's fine if the camera is behind your character , but when the camera angle switches you need to do some quick mental gymnastics to figure out which way left or right is.Shooting zombies is fun , but there 's no intelligent or tricky combat . You 'd have to rotate all the way around ( there 's a hotkey for it ) , push forward and pray there are no obstacles or camera angle switches . The controls are just too hard to handle when attempting to do anything fast paced . The static camera angles are very bad . The moan of zombies lets you know they 're in the room , but you often can not see them because of the poorly positioned camera . You either have to fire at off-screen enemies or wander closer hoping the camera will switch.Do n't forget to respect the glass . While guns can make zombies meet their end , they ca n't break windows or mirrors . You have a limited number of bullets and should guard them carefully . This is especially annoying with rooms where enemies will magically come back to unlife when you walk out and back in because you have to waste more bullets re-killing them.If you 're a fan of the series or enjoy slower paced games with strong stories and good graphics this game is for you . If you 're an action junky , this game does n't deliver and you should take a look at Onimusha or Devil May Cry .	-1
Being new to the genre , I , for 5 years now , have been hearing that Resident evil is the most goriest and scariest game on the market . So I rented this one for PS2 . This has to be the most overrated garbage I 've ever played . The battles are so boring , I could crawl on my hands and knees and go faster than these zombies . The dogs ? They 're awful . To think that dogs are demons are stupid enough . This makes a fishing game look like Final Fantasy ! And the voiceovers , ugh ! Especially that boy . `` You 'd only slow me down ! Huaa ! '' What a ... nerd . Do n't play it .	-1
This game totally sucks majorly me and my dad were trying to play this game we got on the first level and then could n't even get off the first level with reading the instruction manual too and cheats off of cheats codesguides .com worst game ever the first level your stuck in cell in complete darkness and keep walking around and then get no where . Do n't waste your money on this there are plenty of other PS1 and PS2 games that you can waste your money on . Oh and you can play PS1 games on the PS2 for those of you who do n't know that .	-1
Capcom does n't seem to realize that people play video games for entertainment , not torture . The first boss battle is so hard I just took out the disk and threw it into the trash bin . This is not my idea of fun ! Do n't waste your money on this crap . All you do is run around looking for things to help you move on . You get pathetic weapons with very limited ammo , then you fight enemies that are very hard to kill ( you unload almost your entire clip just to kill one lousy zombie ) . RE3 is alot better than this one - at least Jill knows how to dodge . If you still wan na try this game , do n't pay more than 5 bucks !	-1
This is by far the stupidest game ever made . And its a shame because I love the resident evil series but this game is an embarassment you should rent before you buy it . Or save precious time and not play it at all	-1
I 've tried several times to play this game and I can hardly get through it at all . I 'm a big fan of the RE series , I own almost every game they 've ever made and I 've played through most of them several times . This is obviously the exception . I 'm not giving up on it yet , it 's just so ridiculous . The graphics are beyond bad and the game itself is insanely difficult . I did find it terrifying , which is part of the point , so kudos on that one , Capcom .	-1
This review may go against the grain and many readers will hate me , but here goes ... .I REALLY wanted to love Silent Hill 2 , as I thought the first game was fantastic , but when I got it and started playing it , it soon struck me that what I had was a high-res , polished-up retread of the first game , only less frightening . The game does indeed look gorgeous , and the characters and locations are superbly rendered , but it just is n't different enough . Instead of the spooky school , amusement park , motel and hospital , this time you get an apartment block , prison , hotel and , err , hospital ... What again ? Yes , blood stained beds , grimy basements , zombie nurses , its all a repeat of the first version , which seriously disappointed me . Whats more , the monsters are all real pushovers , and can easily be avoided , theres no threat like the leaping dogs or flying creatures from before . And the bosses may look the business , but they too are disappointingly easy , even the final one.Bottom line is , all the scary innovations from SH1 are merely repeated here , to less effect . The game is short and uninvolving , you can run around for hours without getting a scratch on you , as theres far too much ammo and health to pick up ( and I played on the normal setting ) , so you 'll never feel in any danger . Another thing is that the heightened sense of realism means that some of the restrictions put upon what you can do are nonsensical . If James comes to street that is blocked off by just a lousy piece of police tape , he is unable to pass through ! ! Search a room in the hotel , but access to certain areas is denied because of strategically placed pieces of furniture , like a small chair that could be kicked aside by a child ... What a shame that the series could not go any further than this , for although it will impress newcomers to the genre , it is nowhere near as impressive as the first game was when it hit the shelves those few years ago .	-1
Ok , it is eerie and creepy , but you spend literally 20 minutes walking without ever finding anything . Yes there is eerie mist over everything and the soundtract is creepsville , but the game will put you to sleep before anything actually happens.The first minute of Bond Agent under fire contains more excitement than the first 1 hour of this game ! And your character ca n't stop moaning about how miserable he is since his wife dies -- get over it -- I might actually feel something if the game contained any excitement.Rent it , and you will spend the first 1 hour of gameplay walking around ( not lost mind you ) before you actually find a monster . To walk from teh beginning to the town takes 20 minutes , and there is only ONE thing in between , and this is a cheesy cimematic scene . Maybe I should give this 1 star ... .but , once it gets going , it has the usual Resident Evil stuff , gross and gory and spooky , but too drawn out and boring . After each thing , you have to walk across the entire town for the next . WHY ? ? Nothing happens ! ! I wonder if this is just so the manufacturer can say that the game has hours of gameplay ( they just do n't tell you it is all walking in circles ! !	-1
I never saw a horror-survival game before , and the idea of a spooky game intrigued me . So , I rented Silent Hill 2 . I figured I would be scared out of my mind , battling monsters that pop up out of nowhere , hearing strange spooky sounds , basically playing the game on the edge of my seat . How wrong I was.First off , this is a sorry attempt at a game . People say this is a puzzle game . In it 's loosest definition - yes it is . The same way old games like King 's Quest were puzzle games . Basically , all you do is walk . That 's it . You walk . Really nothing else . You walk and hope you find something . Then you walk some more and hope that the thing you found works on something else . That 's it . There 's no complex or intriguing puzzle , it 's just search around until you grab something.That was cool , in the 1980s , when game makers needed to make 50 hour games while only developing a few background scenes and characters . This is the 2000s , and there is no excuse for it now.So , all you do is walk and fight or dodge an occasional monster . That would n't be so bad - if they did n't make walking the most mind numbing experience in the world ! To move from one end of the street to the other takes forever . The controls are sticky and clumsy , and the guy is really , really slow . Since there 's fog or darkness , you constantly have to check the map to see if heading in the next direction.How about the environment ? Not once was I scared or awed . The graphics are below par for a Playstation 2 game . The fog is cool for a second , but annoys you afterwards . The monsters are a joke . They 're little bodies that could n't frighten a 8 year old girl loaded with caffeine.Also , the `` puzzles '' are just plain ridiculous . For example , here 's what you have to do when you enter the town . You 're just in the town with no explicit instructions . So you wander , then wander some more , then you finally find a key . Big whoop , a key . Then you wander some more to find where the key goes to . So , after playing for an hour , you 've opened a gate . In Grand Theft Auto 3 , you would have already killed a few people , and completed some fun missions . In ICO , you would have explored a large castle , rescued a girl , and escaped dreadful spirits . This game - you only opened a damn gate . Once you 're in the apartment building , you wander around rooms and hallways that look the same . Finally , after another hour , what do you get ? A cool new weapon ? A great story cut-scene ? No - you get a flashlight . What does the flash light do ? Reveal new secrets ? Find new terrifying monsters ? No - you can now read the map of the apartment building . Two and a half of hours of game play , and I 've done is enter an apartment building and looked at the map . Bored already ? What 's worse is when you need to something to continue the story , but they wo n't tell you what . This means you could be conceivably stuck at one point for hours because of you did n't do something subtle in a room that is far at the other side of the apartment building . Remember , moving to one side of the apartment building to the other is a major chore in itself . After being stuck for a few hours because I did n't go outside and look in the dumpster and pick up a coin , I knew this game had no hope . I continued on until I reached another apartment building that looked exactly the same . I promptly shut off my PS2 and returned the game to [ the store ] .Finally , in order to save , you actually have to actively search out the save game places . This was the final straw.I kind of wanted to see the ending , but then I figured what it was . Here 's a spoiler for you . The monsters that roam the town ? They 're not trying to kill you . Their the dead corpses of the players who were bored to death , warning you to return this game immediatately ! You want a good puzzle game ? Get ICO instead . This game just plain [ smells ] . It stretches a small environment into a major chore in order to squeze some playabilty out of you .	-1
That 's not true , I did enjoy the manga-styled Bomberman movie scenes , but the game ... EUH ! It 's the ancient style , offers very little , and NO variety . I enjoyed the N64 Bomberman for it 's multi-player , here they left that out and it left a big gap . Trying to play is ridiculous , the computer loses about 7 percent of the time , and it 's no fun attempting to beat them . You never feel responsibility for the loss . The game can change soo quickly that it might as well be set to one minute , to save us time . There 's way too much going on in one screen , like 50 different things and it 's like you 're supposed to try to watch it all , and you do n't ... and you lose . Also , there is n't even an Adventure mode here ! It 's all bombing in a small space . You always start out in a cramped area , far away from opponents . It 's so old , and dull , it 's begging for a drastic gameplay overhaul , like the N64 version ( not saying that was great , but it WAS a direction with genuine innovation ) . All of the elements exist for a fun game , but it does n't ever come together . I kept wondering when I would get to the fun part . ...	-1
I have been a fan of the Lufia games since the first one was released on the SNES here in America . When I heard the Game Boy Color was receiving an Estopolis game , I was immediately e-mailing Natsume . & quot ; Will you guys be releasing it in America as Lufia 3 ? & quot ; It 's finally here . I plug it in . All indications -- pretty graphics , fun dialog , wonderful battle system , great play mechanics , good storyline , even great music , the best on the Game Boy Color -- cause me to smile and giggle and thank the heavens . I 'm enthused to say the least.Then I figure it out . Every dungeon is completely random . But I keep playing . And playing . And I try so hard to like it . SO hard . The storyline is keeping me going , the combat is wonderful.Every dungeon may be random , but they are all EXACTLY the same . Wander around hitting walls and things until you 've explored the level the go to the next . 10 or so levels later , you have a boss fight and a story sequence.Repeat.Repeat.My heart is absolutely broken . How can this happen ? The heart of the Estopolis games has always been the wonderful dungeons , now replaced by this absolute drudgery.Try before you buy , and make sure you have tissues to dry your tears . I am praying that the Game Boy Advance Estopolis is released here , and that the dungeons , while they will still be random , will be more sensical and have non-random segments.This game had everything going for it , and one major flaw destroys it . Why oh why ?	-1
Lufia : Game Boy Color game , it stinks so bad , the game is just about religion and what not . This game is SO boring that it does n't even deserve to be played . If you want a game goto Digital Press and pick up a copy of Super Mario Land 2 : 6 Golden Coins . This game is the worst game ever in that matter ; if you want your 10/10 get an original game boy w/ all of the Super Mario Land Games .	-1
I was not fortunate enough to have played the SNES game , but I thought this game was a major snore . I really hate random dungeons . Actually , I 'm not thrilled with dungeons at all , but these were longer and more tedious than any I had ever dealt with before . The story was bland and the characters were not well defined . It 's also full of spelling and grammatical errors that should have been caught if they 'd spent more time on it . Altogether , this game struck me as a rushed job by people who do n't really care about it . The save system stinks too . I hate only being able to save my game at certain times , I ca n't guarantee I 'll have several uninterrupted hours to play and I like to be able to stop when I need to . Also , the story sequences take way too long .	-1
Man this is the worst game I 've had the misfortune of buying ... I mean customer who 'll buy it off me . Anyway the graphics take us back to that old PS game Akuji . While that 's not all that horrible I thought I 'd at least get Soulreaver graphics on a PS2 game ! Also the brightness of the game is pretty low . Going in the water is horrible , you can barely make out your character ! The load times are also longer than the single load time on NBA Live 2001 ! ! Also the game seems to load at every minor junction . Just getting past the training portion I had to wait for loading about 6 times ! ! Finally the controls are not bad but nothing to write about , so I wo n't . Overall I was highly dissapointed with the game . More than I want my money back , I want those missed hours of my life back !	-1
I can not believe I spent the money for this game . This is a gamers worst fear to buy a game like this one . A friend told me of a Viking game on a PC that was totally awesome and said it was a must buy . He must of meant some other Viking game called Rune : Viking Warlord cause this game was awful not awesome . The loading time , the crazy controls , the lack of a descent story are all reasons to avoid this title like the black plague . I mean it - the only reason I gave it one star is cause that was the worst I could . The best thing about this title is the time it gives you while it is loading . For instance you could clean your room , walk your dog , mow the lawn , paint the house , wash your car , and even sleep in the amount of time it takes between each level . This is really an awful title . Sorry if you already bought it .	-1
But this was one of the worst . I have to agree with most people here . Avoid Rune at all costs .	-1
Vikings. Got ta love em.Tearing mutton right off the bone sans utensils , donning ever fashionable pelt and ram horn outfits , and never letting the smell of blood leave their nostril hairs , have established Vikings to some as the ambassadors for masculinity at its mightiest.Unfortunately , RUNE VW MAKES TIM ROBBINS FROM ERIK THE VIKING LOOK LIKE THE HARDEST NORSEMAN TO SWING A BATTLE AXE.Expect to laugh out loud when enemies sprint past Ragnar { so he has to run after them } , make a U-ey then decide to attack him.Or how about the annoying falling boulders , oversized carp looking for lunch , and turnstiles that remarkably cause instant death.Weapons , albeit plentiful , ae n't thrilling to behold or obtain.And cheesy haunted house style ambient backdrops , as well as voiceovers that come off amateurishly pitched down , not ominously Odin-ish , make one wonder if human head 's just being facetious.All in all , since it 's hard to take RVW 's action or adventure elements seriously , it 's snooze city.Shame.Never thought Vikings could be boring .	-1
I had the misfortune of playing this game as well , and might I say I was greatly disappointed . Do n't judge games by their covers . Being a pagan myself , I had high hopes for my hero Ragnar , but that R3 camera rotating to see what you were doing sucked SO much I did n't even bother finding out what OTHER aspects of the game blew.Do n't waste your money OR time on this . I 'm tempted to do an `` angry video game nerd '' and try to get through it , but I ca n't see spending $ 2 on a used copy that is n't even worth the plastic it is printed on .	-1
Avoid at all costs . These guys were just not up to the challenge of making a PS2 game .	-1
Tell you what , do n't think that Rune is a bad game , it is horrible for the PS2 though , because sony playstation 2 is too weak to handle the Unreal Technology ... BUT , the PC and MAC versions are a lot better.OK , why should you NOT buy the PS2 kind ? Just because the frame rates are low , graphic details look extremely blurry ( you might even think you need glasses , because you wo n't believe that the developers would actually put such graphics for the PS2 ) , and the controls are terrifying . There is only one , very minor pro there : the game is quite long , but since the two of the most important factors of a good game are so stinking bad , it does not matter.I RECOMMEND YOU TO BUY THE PC VERSION , WHICH I WOULD RATE 5 STARS , ...	-1
There is nothing about this game that I like . The camera is annoying , the controls clumbsy and the music uniteresting . The graphics were ok , but the scenes were too dark and depressing for me . The monsters were unimaginitive and the weapons pretty typical . I got through a few days and realized that not only did I not care , but I was really unhappy with it . I kept playing , thinking something would make it worth the reduced price I paid for it . I have n't played it since . I wish I could give it zero stars .	-1
When I heard of a PS2 version of Clive Barker 's Undying I began to drool . After a few days I was given the bad news that it was caned . ( Bad PC edition sells , they say ) Too bad , I think . I am a FPS maniac , you know ? Even if this great game was murdered , we still have Red-Faction ( which I own ) , Time-Splitters ( whish I do n't ) , the coming up Deus-Ex , Medal of Honor : Frontline , a rumored Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Half-Life . So I go to the store and shell 50 dollars on Half-Life , without ever knowing how the PC game originally was.Boy was I slapped ! I know this game got many game of the year awards and other similar honors , but the problem is that I can not see how or why . Yes , I know that FPS are n't the most amazing of games when it comes down to story line ( With CV 's Undying and Deus-Ex as exceptions ) and the plots are rather generic . ( Experiment gone wrong , etc ) But this one had nothing to offer , IMO . I heard somewhere that Red Faction is a lame copy of this game , but I find myself preferring it over Half-Life any day of the week . The weapons are uninspiring and the enemies are n't that amazing at all . ( With the sole exception of the Marines and those face-hugger like things ) I must confess , though , that the missions are good , but this is not enough to hold my attention for long.This is merely and opinion , but you sure as hell need to rent it first before you buy it .	-1
I bought a Half Life and add-on pack because of all the hype surrounding HL . You would think being Game of the Year would mean that its actually good . Ha ! , not the word i would use.Maybe i am too much into realism in my games , real weapons , real people etc , but I thought HL was ^ & # ^* . I would not recommend Half Life and i ca n't understand why it was so popular .	-1
I realize I 'm reviewing an old game here and I 'm writing this review with 2008 standards . Please keep in mind I am only reviewing the PS2 version ( not PC ) .If you 're one of those fans considering to track this old game ( on PS2 ) and spend lots of money on it -- do n't bother wasting it.The PS2 version is just really frustrating . Some games still look good on the PS2 even to this day . However , this game just is n't worth tracking down and playing it again , on the PS2.Like most games that are poorly ported onto console , this game is no exception . There are many slowdowns . That is my biggest complaint . It 's not that the graphics are so demanding , but it just is n't optimized well.This game is considered a classic and really took FPS to a whole new level when it came out . However , to fully appreciate that , even in today 's standard , go with the PC . Instead of paying $ 20 or more for the PS2 , just for the rare factor ( unless you just want to put it on your shelf or something and collect dust ) , it 's better to buy the Half-Life Anthology ( where you get many expansions ) for less than $ 10 now . You do n't even need a fast computer and everything will be smooth . Plus , you 'll get to use a keyboard and mouse -- the way it is meant to be played.But for better graphics , I recommend getting the Orange Box , which has Half-Life 2 and even the original Half-Life with updated graphics.So my 1-star rating is for the PS2 version.Update : The Orange Box does not seem to include Half-Life : Source ( original Half-Life game with updated graphics ) ; however , it seems you can purchase/download later on Steam for about $ 10 extra . Since The Orange Box is around $ 30 now , it 's not too bad , considering most of us paid $ 50 for Orange Box when it was first released . However , I think the best way to go is try to track down `` Half-Life 2 : Game of the Year Edition '' , which includes Counter-Strike : Source as well .	-1
This is goin to be fun . Half-Life is without a doubt the worst video game I have every played in my lifetime and that 's saying something . I beat the first four levels in the game and then I honestly could n't take it anymore . The story is ... not well planned , the monsters are dumb and kill you easily , the characters and graphics are bad , really bad , and finally , the whole set up is just plain [ bad ] . The multiplayer is no better with rooms the size of a small box and the weapons [ are not good ] too . I mean , the crowbar is the best thing to use . When a gun is n't good enough to kill people in a first person shooter , you know you 've got problems . Please save yourself and do n't buy this game . I 'm so glad I borrowed it from my friend instead of buying it . Heed my words fellow video gamers , Half-Life is terrible	-1
This game was too hard to learn . It took me 30 minutes just to figure out how to build a building and it took me 15 minutes after that to figure out what i did . dont listen to what anyone else tells you . dont buy . big waste .	-1
There is one reason why I give this game 1 star . Because of one reason ... the game is creepy . Why is it creepy ? If you are a smart gamer like me , you know most Wario bosses are disturbing . The bosses in this game give me NIGHTMARES ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
are you kidding me ? i bought this game and within less than a week i returned it ! it was the worst game i have ever played ! if you like wario get one of the old wario games like warioland 2 for the original gba or ... you can just hate wario ! sure at first you play it it seems good ... i loved it at first but then it just gets lamer and lamer i mean who ever heard of getting stung by a bee and turning all swollen and flying ... it is ridiculous ! o and turning into a triangle block ! i couldnt even lookat it in stores it was so horrible and not to mention the price ... ( depending on where you get it ) for that piece of junk ! im serious im not just writing this cus all my other reviews are usually 5s but this game is horrible kirby is a pretty bad game but not worse than this ! i fell asleep while playing it wen i woke up my batteries were barely left ! they should probably give you some free bateries with it !	-1
In this game , you can shoot webs , swing across the sky and fight evil through many levels . Sound like fun ? think again . This game was one of the worst I 've ever played . Each level is tightly scripted , and offers little exploration and freedom . The bosses , freak-specimens , criminals and other evil dwellers that you come across are so similar it 's boreing . Though they look different , they fight the same . A punch here ... A shot there , it gets dull fast . The levels are repetitive , and it becomes a real chore to play through the game . The graphics ar n't the best and the sound sucks . Do n't wast your money on this game .	-1
They are 6 different colors pictured , but you only get clear and blue , and they fit , what more can I say about them . You can store pennies in them , or use them to hold your toenail clippings , or you can ... put your games in them.It really stinks that Nintendo makes us but these , they used to come with the older games .	-1
Man I thought this game would be a whole lot more exciting ! Through most of the game you fight stupid flukes-with-legs that you can pick off from across the room with no repercusions . The enemy AI is simply not smart enough to be called an AI . The controls remind me of Tomb Raider I . While that was a great game back in the day , we 've suppossedly made great leaps in game controls since then . The story is kinda neato . I just wish there was at least some kind of multiplayer thing to do or some other game modes or something . Quite a disappointment .	-1
Mutant Marines , virus spitting takpoles and Aliens interior decor all serve to tingle gamers spines in eztermination , but the real terror literally lies right under one 's nose.Demon controls ! These heinous torture tools will enrage Gahndi patient gamers.Try shooting down multi attacking bloodsuckers in third person with the behind the back camera view.Get used to getting mauled while being forced to stand still th shoot , and expect to kill mucho gaming sessions not infectoids with a completely ineffect oik auto aim.Still , the controls are atleast good for one thing : running something you will be doing a lot of to survive.TREADMILL SIMULATOR ANYONE ?	-1
Not a very good game , even for the PS2 . The voice acting is laughable and the graphics are pretty weak . I would n't recommend wasting your money . Spend your money on The Thing instead ( PS2 ) .	-1
I am a big fan of Survival Horror games and recently Ive been going back and playing older titles I never got a chance to play.To sum it up as simple as possible this game was TRASH . The controls were among the worst I 've ever had to deal with . The Weapons in this game are HORRIBLE . You basically get 1 Rifle the whole game and just keep getting little add ons which are confusing to use.This game felt like a job really . Never at ANY point in this game did I feel like I was having fun or even partially enjoying myself.All I know is this change in some ways changed my perspective on video games of the past . Theres really no point in going back and beating old garbage video games . If a game was made more than a few years ago and you have n't played theres probaly a good reason why . IT SUCKS like this pathetic knockoff resident evil TRASH ... .Storyline 2/10Graphics 3/10 I honestly feel the RE graphics for PS1 are better.Weapons 1/10Fun 0/10 Id rather slice my eyes open with razorsJUST HORRIBLE IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE ! ! ! ! ! ! Ok I feel slightly better now ! ! !	-1
I 've been a fan of the survival-horror games since the first resident evil , and i 'm a big fan of the series . Extermination clearly does n't cut it compaired to R.E . or silent hill 2 . I found the in-game menus annoying , and the enemies bothersome at best . the graphics were fine , although nothing spectacular . I did n't play enough of it to say how well the plot develops , but it seemed pretty cliched to begin with . If you 're looking for a good survival-horror game for the ps2 , go with R.E . : code veronica , or silent hill 2 if you really want to be scared . If you 've already tried those , you 'll just have to wait for & quot ; the thing & quot ; , which might prove to be the most innovative survival-horror game since the original R.E .	-1
I gave it a one star because I was a MGS fan ( the biggest ever beleive me ) , and I am very disappointed about this game . I Mean i loved the first game i played it 100+ hourse beat it a number of times and liked it so much . MGS2 you dont be snake . And the end you wait for the big ending you say now i know whats gunna happen then BOOM it ends and the whole game is pointless . If you never played MGS then you may like it but if you were hooked on the first , give it a rest . I was dissapointed after waiting 2 years . All the screans of snake you see in the first 2 minutes of the game btw .	-1
-Chad Steingraber -- Paradigm/Infogrames -- Level Designer/Game Designer/3D Artist on The Terminator : Dawn of Fate-Sorry , but this game was not any fun at all . I bought this game because of the previews and all the hype , thinking it was going to be incredible . I played it once for about 30 minutes , was so completely bored out of my mind , I shut it off . About two weeks later , I played it again ... hoping that my last try was just because I was n't in the mood for it . This time I played again for about an hour ... .. I traded it in for Jax and Daxter the next day ... ..at least I learned a good lesson from it -- do n't buy it , unless I know I like it -- What a waste , the only reason it 's getting 2 stars instead of 1 from me , is because of the graphics . It looks awesome , it just plays like crap . Apologies to the die-hard gamers out there , I just could n't stand it .	-1
The graphics and everything in this game are great ! ! ! BUT- the cutscenes ruin everything , it is so boring with them , and it takes several minutes to press the square button with the cutscene stopped . i fell asleep during those boring cutscenes -- - BOTTOM LINE___ the game would be great if the company made an option at the beggining of no cutscenes . 4 those of u who r fans of metal gear- i personnaly recommend not to buy this game ! p.s . everyone who wrote a good review about this game knows how boring the game gets because of the cutscenes	-1
Blah ! I know I 'll end up with a 0/955 helpful ranking , but I just have to comment . I 'm sorry , but I do n't understand why this game was/is such a hit . Sure , it has great graphics and music ( which is why it gets the extra star ) , but other than that ... The storyline is very complex . Apparently you have to get some metal gear pictures before the russians come or something . These cutscenes , as stated in previous reviews , take FOREVER . Half the time you do n't even know what they 're talking about , and you do n't want to skip over it for fear you might miss something important . Then when it 's finally time to actually PLAY the game , BAM ! Horrid camera angle . Oh , and believe me , you do n't get too far before you end up with another cutscene . And so goes the game.I 'm sorry , I really wanted to like this game , but I just ca n't get into it . If I wanted a spy movie , I would 've rented one . If you want REAL action , stick with Vice City .	-1
All right . I know the game got a lot of hype because of it 's great graphics , and it was the sequel to one of the greatest games of all time , but come on , this game flat out [ stinks ] . The gameplay is fun , When you 're actually playing . 90 % of the game is actually movie sequences . I played it through once watching all of them and it took about 16 hours . I played it through again and skipped them , and it took maybe about , 3-4 hours , if that tells you something . Overall a very disappointing game , but it does have a pretty good story so it got two stars .	-1
Cons : Too much and too often talking between charactors.Video segments too longThird person view ( especialy from the top is annoying ) I prefer fist person veiwThe Snake was great but Raiden was some kind of transsexual.In the portion of the game where he is stripped down and you have to actualy play the game with him running around nude with his hand covering his crotch . ( ... ) Pros : Finaly quit playing before the game ended and went to rent a fun game .	-1
Metal Gear Solid appeared on the PlayStation back in 1998 . Next-gen gameplay , a deep storyline and top-notch visuals and sound made it a breakthrough for the industry . Not only was it a revolutionary title for its time that pushed the console to its limits , but it was supposedly a good sign of things to come . That outcome would ultimately be its sequel , Sons of Liberty , one of the most anticipated of all games . The return of hero Solid Snake gave gamers another chance to experience espionage action once again , but given its reputation for its movie qualities over gameplay , when does a game stop being a game ? Sons of Liberty answers this and much more.Everyone was relieved to know Solid Snake made a comeback . With his newly formed team with Otacon , their mission objective was to discover the circumstances surrounding the new Metal Gear and make it known to the public . It started out great , drawing you in with the plot slowly unfolding and the continuation of Snake 's story . Suddenly as a unexpected shock to everyone , gamers are soon placed in the perspective of a new character , Jack , a.k.a . Raiden . We are now playing as a whiny , snobbish and clueless rookie who gets in annoying conversations with his girlfriend , Rose . Why the developers chose to use the names 'Jack ' and 'Rose ' from the movie Titanic is beyond anyone 's comprehension . Also , with film music composer Harry Gregson-Williams handling composition duties , it hints that Konami was more intent on creating a movie than making a game.Raiden is without a doubt the star here yet Kojima did an excellent job of hiding it , not to mention tricking and deceiving the whole world into thinking Snake was the only playable character . Nowhere in the previews or even on the packaging was Raiden spoken of . The game has also somewhat lost the gritty military nature of its predecessors , becoming more of a sci-fi fantasy drama . The convoluted storyline that no one wants to figure out and the uninteresting cast of characters ( which includes a bisexual vampire and a roller-blading fat guy ) do n't do the gameplay much justice , which has you mostly defusing explosives as well as babysitting little sisters in between boss battles . Since the entire incident was a Shadow Moses simulation , a majority of the gameplay structure and plot elements are simple rehashes from the first Metal Gear Solid.The cutscenes and dialogue , which were more tolerable in the first MGS , are lengthy and often downright unbearable . Many games , such as Nintendo 's Ocarina of Time and Squaresoft 's Vagrant Story , do a great job of balancing gameplay and cinemas . Sons of Liberty , however , does not seem to understand the difference between the two . The movies can be skipped over with ease , but doing so means missing out on vital information on the plot . If gamers want to know more of the story , they will have to sit through the movies , amounting to overly long periods of time . Watching the cinemas will make the game long and boring , while skipping them will make the game incredibly short . It 's unrewarding either way you go.Visually , Sons of Liberty is one of the better-looking PS2 titles , even today . The in-game and demo music , sound effects and voice-acting will be some of the best you will ever hear in a console game . The inclusion of the first-person viewpoint is also a welcome addition to the franchise . The story is definitely difficult to fully comprehend , but most players will give up trying to even care anyway . These stand-out aspects still can not save Sons of Liberty from falling into the category of games that emphasize cinematics over gaming substance . The game tries hard to give its life message , in which we are treated to a well-deserved ending . But what someone has to endure to see that ending is just not worth it . Not even Solid Snake 's Tanker Chapter helps heighten the replay value and fun factor . For those who do value gameplay as the dominant characteristic of games , Metal Gear Solid 2 : Sons of Liberty will simply pass as a title that is disappointing . With The Twin Snakes and Snake Eater joining the series , Sons of Liberty should be easily forgotten ( or at least remembered for its unforgiving experience ) .	-1
Metal Gear Solid 2 is the most dissapointing , melodramatic , unexciting game I 've bought in the last few years . After seeing videos from E3 two years ago , I was anticipating this game like none other , and bought a Playstation 2 when it was released.There are some real problems with this game . First of all , it tries to be something that it 's not . I shaked my head in disgust during the opening sequence , as the developer 's names appeared like out of a movie , even pretentiously displaying the cliche of `` any resemeblance to real life is entirely coincidental '' .Hideo Kojima , the `` director '' of Metal Gear Solid 2 is so high on himself , he goes so far as to refer to it as a `` Hideo Kojima game '' . After viewing this initial display of fake Hollywood gloss , I was presented with the actual game , which is tedious and ridiculous.I 'm not the first one to complain about it , but for only two hours , you play as Snake . The beginning of the game is intriguing , bringing back memories of the PS1 classic ; the action and stealth are top notch , the suspense kept high with some riveting encounters and the fantastic new graphics . Once you finish with Snake , the game becomes a train wreck . The rest of the game you play as a different character , Raiden , who is a sniveling , petulant , cowardly `` hero '' .The story is an absolute disaster , and since the game 's focus is more on that than actual gameplay , the overall value is spoiled . It involves tenuous diaglogue and double crosses , with endless cutscenes spliced between playing . The actual gameplay is monotonous ; it consists of Raiden running around `` The Big Shell '' , peforming mundane tasks such as diffusing C4 and searching for THE PRESIDENT . Originality in it 's finest.The developers saw how successful they were with the original Metal Gear Solid and suddenly thought they were movie directors . Initially , Metal Gear Solid 2 looked like it was going to be an action packed , exciting game . Instead , it 's a pretentious diversion , as it spirals downward after the first 2 hours , flooded with endless dialogue and boring action , wanting to be more like a movie that an interactive gaming experience .	-1
It 's obvious from the opening sequence that a lot of effort went into this game . The graphics and music are top notch . Unfortunately , the game focuses entirely on the eye and ear candy instead of gameplay and story . It is , in essence , a horrible , horrible movie.The Metal Gear franchise has never been known for believible plots , but MSG2 takes this to a whole new level . Like always , there 's a huge governmental conspiracy , this time engineered by people that supposedly died 500 years ago . Riiiggghhht.What 's even more infuriating is the fact that MSG2 is really only a side-story . Those of you looking forward to playing as Solid Snake again will be sorely disappointed . Instead , his efemminate counterpart , Raiden , takes center stage . He 's the typical anime adrogenous hero , all pasty skin and long hair . His story is not compelling in the least , and the setup to the climax is , in a word , stupid . Anyone with half a brain will quickly see where he fits in the Metal Gear universe.To make matters worse , all of the `` plot twists '' in the game merely serve to create un-needed confusion , and seem incredibly out of place in the middle of a conflict . Otacon 's story just reeks of a soap opera cliche.The enemies in the game all have their own repetoire of abilities , and are all portrayed as two-dimensional , melodramatic [ fools ] . They look neat and flashy , but never seem dangerous . Instead , they seem rather comical , which eradicates any sense of true drama . I know I 'm not afraid of some guy that Rollerblades while placing bombs everywhere.The voice acting is once again horrible . Like in the previous game , emotion is handled via melodrama . The voices range from growly to whiney , with no middle ground . They neither endear me to the heroes , nor do they make me fear the villains.Finally , there is the gameplay . The gameplay , like in the original , is great . Unfortunately , the game hardly lets you play . The plot moves through a series of cutscenes . You find out where to go , go there , see a cutscene of the enemy , kill the enemy , then watch another cutscene . Repeat until you finish the game.In a phrase , this game is not a game . It 's a horrible interactive movie . Do n't waste your money or your time .	-1
If you are like others , then when you are getting a video game , you actually want to play it , not watch it . So that 's why this & quot ; video game & quot ; can not be classified as one . You are going to be watching the cutscenes for the most part in Metal Gear Solid 2 , so do n't expect to experience any intensity or adrenaline while you & quot ; play & quot ; this game . The gameplay itself is n't that great to hide that flaw . While the graphics are very good ( I have seen a lot better visuals in other action games ) , it is not a lot of fun to watch a movie made with an in-game engine , where the developers include a gimmick that allows you to rotate the camera and zoom in while you watch.Overall , MGS2 is a lack-of-gameplay kind of game . Sure , the graphics are nice when you have those tight little rooms to play in , that is why Konami could raise the bar in the graphics , because there are no wide-open spaces that could limit the quality of the graphics . Places where the game is set have a very & quot ; locked & quot ; feel to them , with small rooms , tight corridors , and very limited outdoor environments . There is a lot of detail though : high quality weather effects , nice facial expressions , rain bouncing off the barrel of your firearm , fluid and smooth animation , real-looking smoke , fire , ... .nothing that you would not find in other games of 2001 , there is nothing special in MGS2 . The audio on the other hand is pretty much like the first Metal Gear - the audio is great , the voice acting is superb , and the sound is very well done , unlike in other games that have good graphics but lack good sound ( it is very common these days ) , Metal Gear Solid 2 is an exception , with outstanding sound , voice-acting , and soundtrack.The actual gameplay is based on stealth . The AI in the game is smart and the enemies will not shoot you as soon as they see you , unlike in other games they will try to avoid shooting you upon the encounter unless they really need to , it is the same thing the cops would do to the bad guy if there is no threat of them being killed . They will try to disarm you and knock you out , and that kind of stuff - all of it is pretty cool . The interaction between Snake and the NPCs ( non-player characters ) is astounding . Snake can sneeze all of a sudden and give himself up or if he is careless , guards can locate him by following his footprints . He also can distract guards in all kinds of ways , for example , he can drop something on the floor when nobody is watching , wait for a guard to come by , this item will draw the guard 's attention and eventually will lead him to either being killed or incapacitated . Snake can also hide the bodies of the fallen enemies from other guards so they will not become alert . This is what you will see in Hitman.In Conclusion , MGS2 is not for a hardcore gamer . The part where you play the game is short , the story is easy to get lost in , and guards will come back to life - very annoying , and the fact that the best cover is a cardboard box is pathetic . The main weakness ( to most people , but some think it is a strong point ) is that a big portion of the game is cutscenes and an overwhelming and extremely complex story . On the plus side you have those & quot ; brilliant & quot ; , & quot ; gorgeous & quot ; , & quot ; breathtaking & quot ; , or whatever-you-call-it graphics , which are no big deal to me . What also is great ? - got ta be the sound . What I would say ? - if you like stealth so much , get this game , if you are a big fan of Solid Snake/Metal Gear , you probably already have it , some of you are disappointed , some of you are glad the way this game was done , but for me , a true video game enthusiast , this game is no biggie , could have been a whole lot better if it was more like the first one .	-1
This game has more potential packed into it than any other game that has ever been made . But unfortunately falls short of a being a great game . First off the graphics , the overall look of the game is really nice , but it stops there . The characters are ugly with terrible motion captured animation , poorly designed Bosses and trite uninspired level design . Where are the huge military bases where you sneak around and use all your skill to dodge guards ? Apparently not in this game . Gameplay is basically the same as the first Solid title with some new and cool additions but on the other and a frustratingly impossible to aim with first-person mode . Sound is pretty much dead on with a good score to boot . Overall replay value , uh ... err..there is n't any . One time through and it 's over , 12-15 hours long or rather 7-8 , minus those cuts scenes . Going back though to collect all the dog tags does not count for replay . Where are the VR missions ? They sure as hell droned on about them in this monstrosity but they are not in this game and would really have upped the value of this game . I had my hopes up for this one but I can only recommend you rent it or wait 2 weeks for people to figure out they did not really care for this game and pick it up used for [ amount ] less .	-1
Basically ... This game sucks . The graphics suck , the dialog is boring , this title is overrated . I sold my copy to some idiot on eBay and I get a negative review because it sucks so bad . I rather play with a barbi than play this POS .	-1
I just did n't enjoy the game . I prefer games with more interactive gameplay than cinematics . It seems like MGS is heavy on story time .	-1
I am not a fan of Metal Gear Solid , or its sequel for the PS2 . Often times great game creators are not great story writers , and that is clearly the case here . The story in Metal Gear Solid 2 makes absolutely no sense , and becomes a chore to sift ( and sit ) through . The game & quot ; features & quot ; hours of cut scenes and cinema that I would much rather do without . If you skip cut scenes whenever possible , the game is relatively short and remains unexciting.Metal Gear Solid features gameplay built on the assumption that trial and error is fun . There are parts of the game where this gameplay mechanic is very successful , and sneaking around areas can be very enjoyable . There are also sections of MGS2 that feel like they were included only to increase the total time it would take someone to finish the game . Overall the gameplay approaches brilliance at times , but the negatives often outweigh the positives.This game has one huge positive going for it : It is absolutely beautiful to look at . I do not own an X-Box , but MGS2 features the best graphics I have ever seen , especially when it comes to in-game action . The attention to detail in the visual presentation is an amazing achievement , and I applaud Mr. Kojima and Konami for that.Overall , MGS2 features brilliant graphics , occasionally fun gameplay , and an absolutely horrid story that makes no sense whatsoever . My vote : 2	-1
This is the worst game ever for a PS2 . Why ? Lets see : No 1st Person view , guns stink , fighting stinks , plot stinks , conversations stink , movies are too long , graphics paritally stink ... to sum it up in two words : THIS GAME STINKS !	-1
I know someone is going to try and bite me for saying this , seeing as how every person I 've ever talked to that has played the Metal Gear Solid games absolutely loved them , but I didn't.I 've got the demo for MGS2 , and played the first game , and if you are one of those rare people who did n't like the first game , this one is more of the same , sure the graphics are tremendously better , but the gameplay is no different .	-1
When the first Armada came out , I was hooked . I played all summer , over and over again . The AI challenged me , and the game never seemed dull.When Armada II came out , I jumped up and got it , and the second I started playing it , I turned it off . The storyline is old and reused - yet another Borg threat . The graphics are sub-par to the original ( in my opinion ) , and the game itself suffers from unrealistic timing.While any RTS needs to produce units fast , the speed which Sovereign class vessels are built is utterly ridiculous . The balance is way off , allowing you to build two or three 16 ship fleets of your top class , and utterly wipe everything out easily . Instead , the game should focus on making small , tough armies using multiple tactics to force your way through , like Warcraft III . The idea would be maybe 4 Akiras with 2 Galaxys , 2 Sovereigns , 6 Sabers , and 2 Intrepids - each with their own strategies and special weapons . Then you can use each class to it 's fullest.Worst is the resources - the cost of ships is so low , you never truly have to worry - honestly ! I never worried . All I concentrated on was building up enough Sovereigns to wipe everyone out.The AI is the worst - the AI never does anything other than try to take all the resources , and then just launch constant strikes - thats it . Even worse , Instant Action games fail to work most of the time . The AI builds a resource base , then simply never work anything again - no ships , no defenses , nothing . It 's pitiful.I recommend buying the game , even with it 's flaws . It can still be fun sometimes , and there are a wealth of mod sites that improve balance and playability ( such as armada2files.com )	-1
If this game were for the original Nintendo it might be decent but even then it would be hard pressed to find an excuse for why it plays so badly.I like 2D fighters . I still think Street Fighter 2 is one of the best games ever made . Samurai Showdown is another classic example of a great 2D fighter . It was this game that made me decide to pick Last Blade 2 up . If you also loved Samurai Showdown and are considering picking this game up , do n't ! This game is just awful.From the lackluster graphics ( even for a 2D game ) to the four frames of animation per sprite ( character ) this game is just a poor example of what fighting games should be . If you want a 2D fighter stick to the Capcom games and you should be fine . If you just want a great fighting game , Dreamcast has one of the best in Soul Calibur . If you 're into samurai , get Bleemcast ( or a PSOne or PS2 ) and get Bushido Blade 2 , but by all means , ignore this piece of junk .	-1
What 's the big deal with this game ? It 's not fun at all . It 's way too fast . I mean , Sonic Adventure 2 : Battle was fast , but not like this . In this game , you ca n't even see where you 're going . And there 's no explanation for anything . I was expecting a cool action/platformer with a few story segments . Instead , I was dropped straight into the first level with no explanation , and there was no break-up between levels , boss battles , and worlds . I was just so confused . It moved so fast that my eyes hurt , and I did n't understand it . It was a big fat waste of money .	-1
When I first saw this game , I was really looking forward to playing it , me being the old-school Sonic fan that I am . Anyway , I picked it up after reading several things on it . And I must say , I was really disappointed in what the game had . In my opinion , it should n't qualify as a Sonic game . The two player mode is really lacking something . The music does n't even compare to the awesome compositions in Sonic 1 and 2 . Yes , I know they included a few songs and stuff from the first game , but that 's about it.The first thing I noticed was the character choices . If you play Sonic 2 or 3 , you have a choice of playing as Sonic , Tails , or both . This game did n't have that , and that was a sorry thing to see . Amy Rose is one of my favorite characters , but I really think that the game would n't lack anything if she was n't a character in the game . The levels and their titles were n't all that spectacular . Sure , they had a lot more boxes than the first games , and what really made me mad was the invincibility . I know they kept the same music , but the invincibility that 's a Sonic trademark is the sparkles that surround the character . This game takes it from Sonic Adventure 2 , and that made me upset , because it 's just not ... Sonic . The moves were hard to get used to , and ( I 'm sorry that I 'm going too in-depth with this stuff , but ... . ) all of the characters should n't have attacks , like in Sonic Adventure . Another thing that really disappointed me was that the levels were just too easy . There did n't seem to be enough badniks and there were n't enough turns and cool stuff like that.I think that people who are n't die-hard Sonic fans would like this game , and it 's pretty simple . But I warn those who love Sonic like I do-this game is not like traditional Sonic.My reccomendation ? Avoid this game , especially if you are a big Sonic fan.~Amy Rose~	-1
Expect to grind for countless hours if you want to clear bosses . Each act contains six quests ( often overlapping ) and then a final act boss . The act quests are reasonably challenging without being too frustrating , but act bosses will kill you in sometimes one , usually two shots unless you grind for an obscenely long time to get a few levels.Example : I played without grinding to the end of act 2 , coming to the final boss with a Level 23 Druid with 146 hit points . The boss has ( on the EASIEST difficulty ) no less than 4,000 hit points and routinely does over 100 points of damage on a single strike . I have no desire to grind for days upon days to get to level 30 , and so I have uninstalled the game to free hard drive space for something better .	-1
Greeting , friend . Stay a while , and listen ... The original Diablo Battle Chest had Diablo 1 , Diablo 2 , and Lord of Destruction . This is the `` new version '' , and DOES NOT INCLUDE Diablo 1.Buy the older Battle Chest .	-1
These games are excellent , but Diablo II was released in 2000 , and the expansion was released in 2001 . Diablo I is even older , and that game was little more than a stripped down clone of Rogue ( a free , open source computer RPG ) with some prerendered graphics added and a cheezy story.So in essence , the idea for the game is unoriginal , and the latest content in this package was released 7 years ago , which is fast approaching a decade . Yet , they want us to pay $ 40 for this . I 'm sorry , but that makes absolutely no sense ; at best this entire package could be valued at $ 20 , though in all practicality it could be sold for less than that ( republished as a $ 15 single-disc ) .Blizzard is ripping you off . Show them how you feel by not buying it -- borrow it from a friend .	-1
I ordered multiple times through Fulfillment Through Amazon and every single one was the Diablo 2 bundle that does n't include the original game . Had to order through eBay to get what I wanted . Since it 's so old I do n't blame Amazon for mislabeling them on the shelves . Just be aware when purchasing through their Prime service .	-1
Played it once , then never played it again . I remember these games being so much better . lol i guess alot of years have passed .	-1
I thought the concept of a `` downtown '' area for my Sims and newly created Sims ( that come with the downtown atmosphere ) would be cool . They could mingle , hang-out , and make-out . Unless you have a guide book , expert help and advice online , and enormous capabilities for patience ... .you 'll be very bored with this game . It is nearly impossible to get to `` first base '' with your Sims . I was so shocked at how hard just getting along was ( as compared to the original version ) ! It literally can take DAYS just to find two Sims who will date each other , much-less kiss or get `` funky '' . I have , however greatly enjoyed trashing the downtown area that comes with the game and rebuilding my own ! Great fun in that department ! The new downtown objects , people , building supplies , and options are outrageously creative and new ... no budget to worry about ... you just build to your heart 's content . The game can be fun..as long as you are patient . Very patient . I am a bit annoyed with the game right now , but as all gamers know ... someone will eventually post a `` tips and help '' site and then I can imagine this game being a little more fun . Until then it feels much like extra-credit homework in your favorite class ... frustrating but fun . Hot Date has potential ... I would love to hear from anyone who has mastered the lovin ' skills ... do email ! Update : I have owned the game for a while now . At first the game crashed a few annoying times , now I can barely play it . The makers of this game KNOW there are problems with it . i have spoken to them personally on the phone . They have patches to try and fix it . BUT they do n't work ! I have now viewed dozens of websites with others ( literally hundreds of people ) frustrated and having the same problem . I urge all people to wait before purchasing this game now . Check websites and wait to see if there is a functioning patch so you can play this game with ease.I hope this will help keep some of you from wasting your money ! I promise to update again when things change .	-1
I have been a big fan of the sims and when I heard of another expansion well excited does n't cover it.So I max out a charge card and ordered it from one of greatest stores online , Amazon.com.In short the objects are outstanding but you have to tell your sims where to go and what to do the free will play is gone no more sitting back and watching.If your a control freak then this expansion is for you .	-1
I ca n't believe that EA changed their great NHL 2001 into what is now NHL 2002 . No matter how much people deny it , hockey is a defensive sport , and no , that does n't mean full of checking . Electronic Arts is placing the emphasis on the completely wrong side of the game . They make the shooters much better than the goalies because they think that the people who buy the game want hockey games with scores like 15-13 . That is not a hockey game , that 's not even baseball.Checking is made out to be a form of physical punishment toward another player in the game . This is completely untrue and will most likely turn off many of the true hockey fans from this game . A check is any physical contact made in an attempt to knock an opponent off the puck , not to punish another player . It glorifies the big hits way too much and , by default , is set to replay a big hit DURING GAMEPLAY ! ! ! Do you know how annoying that is ? The only plus that I found was the level of the graphics . They are better than NHL 2001 , but not by much . The graphics are the only thing that saved this from a 1-star rating from me .	-1
I wrote a review a while ago about this game saying how it was going to be bad because this game is definetely eye candy ( if u could even call it that ) . I just played the multiplayer demo yesterday , and it was highly dissapointing ... the game has so many bugs i cant describe them all ... but here are a few:1 . VERY LAGGY2 . CAN't HAVE 5 GUNS AT A TIME . MAXIMUM OF 33 . CAN't BIND SOME OF THE CONTROLLS TO THE KKEYS THAT U WANT ( EXAMPLE : Ca n't bind strafe left to left arrow key ) 4 . When you reload , it will do the reloading animation twice or even more sometimes5 . After reloading , it will shoot uncontrollablyThe game is good for one reason . The creativity . No company would think about making a top view war strategy game and then make a sequel to it except it was a first person shooter in the eyes of a soldier in the game . So the only good thing about this game is the creativity . You can see why this game is bad now . Prepare to be dissapointed if you buy this game . Hope this helps , PEACE	-1
i was really disappointed with c & c 's newest release . Although i am not one of those fanatical C & C fans , i do love first person shooters ( fps ) . The AI is the most horrible i 've ever seen in a fps , and i 've played a lot of games . The characters look like boxes , Havoc 's personality is a cardboard cutout , the script and story line is hilariously bad , and Havoc 's lines are corny . Most of all , both the single player and multiplayer are desperately below par . The single player was much too short , the bosses are too easy to kill , and the scenery is atrocious . The multiplayer is just as bad , since the base defences are much too difficult to bypass and you can only carry one weapon at a time . Westwood truly disappointed me with this game , i thought they were capable of a more thought out and prepared game . If you are going to spend [ $ $ $ ] on a game , spend in on Max Payne or Return to Castle Wolfenstein . Unless you 're a diehard C & C fan , this one probably is n't for you .	-1
I love Harry Potter . The books , at least . What 's more , I love computer games . However , my compassion ends there . These two loves do not mix here.Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone ( which still vexes me ; it 's an alchemist 's stone , burn you ! ) is one of the more mediocre games it has been my misfortune to come across . The reasons are as legion as the bowling ball sized beans that lie strewn across the hall . The first complaint is the sheer ridiculousness of the school . Hogwarts , the programmers imagine , is not a pleasant place , full of massive holes in the floor , where death awaits those who wanted to go to class , and teachers will send you off to risk life and limb after teaching you one seemingly useless and completely random spell . How is Lumos supposed to protect me against the Dark Arts , Professor Quirril ? This is hardly the only flaw in the game . Another is the almost complete disregard for any sort of plot . In the introduction , presented in stills stolen from a Harry Potter Day calendar I 'd been given , you are told that as Harry put on the sorting hat , he hoped he would not be put into Slytherin instead of Griffindor . Why ? No explanation is given for what the houses represent . Worse still , Harry seems to have turned into Lenny from Memento : Ron actually comes up to him and says something along the lines of : `` I 'm Ron Weasley , remember me ? '' Other characters are similarly introduced , although Harry should by now know who they are ; at times , it comes across as if they really are assuming you to be a compete fool , telling you peoples names over and over . Except when the characters themselves are incompetent : although Harry makes no decisions or discoveries , he is the one that actually does everything . What plot remains would leave anyone who had n't read the books , or at least seen the film , lost ; those that know how the plot should resolve itself just chuckle as Voldemorte hoarsely coughs `` Die , Potter '' in the unsatisfying yet difficult final level . The only redeeming thing about the whole ordeal is a good John Cleese impersonator . At least , I pray to God he was n't actually the voice in this game . He 's worth more then that.The real problem with the game , though , is not that it 's bad , but that people will want it regardless . It 's Harry Potter , after all . Had it been a good game , then people might buy other games , and the industry as a whole gains . Instead , the game is mediocre , and the people who could have gotten hooked , do n't . Do n't bother buying it , gamer or fan . Either way , it 's a waste .	-1
this game is SOOOOO fun.. but SOOO easy and short.. i beat this game in 2 days ... dont get me wrong ... this game is fun . but it gives only 4 hours of gameplay ( no strategy guides ) the game gta3 , gives about 100 hours of gameplay . thats the difference . Every level is wicked easy accept for the one where u sneak down from the tower , and the last level where u fight that ugly person . again , i say u should rent this game , ( for ps or ps2 ) , blockbuster gives u a week of rental with ur ... . GAMEs FREEDOM PASS ! ! ... rent this game for a week , and beat it in a day .	-1
First things first . You learn spells how ? Tracing the symbol with your mouse . Big Whup . it is just a cheap immitation of a leading series . half of the game , all you have to do is click , move , click , move , click , etc . the recreation of the story is so-so ( which is responsible for the 1 * ) . i will list the pros and cons later , but first a graphics check . The { so-called } advanced graphics did n't run with my computer , so Harry 's eyes were on top of his head , beside the mouth . I not so sure it was my computer , either , because I have a NVidia Geforce 3 , 64 bit video card . I would buy Jedi outcast instead . one more thing , Snape is n't that mean . and , furthermore , Harry can jump 10 feet . come on ! and now , the moment you have been waiting for , the Pro-con list ! Pros1.good Quidditch recreation2.relatively good storylineCons1.graphics could n't be worse2.jumping is unreal3.spells are too easily cast4 . ( the cruncher ) IT IS NOT EXITING OR LONG ENOUGH	-1
Loved the books ... hate this game . Admittedly , I may not have given this game a chance . The graphics are poor and movement is archaic . What 's up with using the arrow keys ? What ever happened to games which allow you to use a joy-pad or mouse ( more effectively ) . In their haste to release a video game to accompany the movie craze , EA has classified their loyal customers as well as the general public as idiots willing to spend money on any kind of & quot ; Harry Potter & quot ; junk . From what I can tell , this game is n't even worthy of release as freeware . Perhaps the game improves later . I would n't know because the flashing blue , red , green & amp ; yellow lights all over the Hogwart 's castle walls gave me a headache . I wasted my money on this game and made the conscious decision not to waste any more of my time trying to play it .	-1
I think this game is pretty bad . There are too many problems that I am going to list here : *Not enough save points*Hard to move your wand around to cast the spell at the enemies*Everything is an adventure they never let u relax*In quidditch it is kinda hard to catch the stupid snitch*sometimes the game will go really slow with older systemsAlso you ca n't explore and this game is n't that good anyway .	-1
This is sadly one of the few games that I felt so bad about that I needed to write a review . My biggest complaint is that all shots by the enemy AI are predetermined whether they will hit you or not . This part of the game is beyond frustrating . Whenever you try to duck behind cover it does n't matter because once that bullet is launched its gon na hit you one way or the other . All evasive maneuvers are pointless . On top of this , if you stumble upon an enemy and blow him away , he falls back and stumbles as bullets hit him . Magically he can still fire , his gun is pointed straight at the ground , but you can watch the bullet fly out and still hit you , even if his back is to you . The enemy also always knows where you are unless there on patrol . Patrollers you can sneak up on and kill , however , everyone else is always pointing there gun at you . Its rather frustrating walking around a corner to find a fortress with everyone 's gun already pointed at you . The damage model is also horrendous . It always takes three shots to kill someone with a basic rifle and more with a pistol or submachine gun . The only headshot that actually kills someone is the sniper rifle . The enemies are also everywhere , you have to search every single corner of every single house , because there is always some random guy cowering in a corner just waiting for you to pass by . This is not unrealistic per say , it just that there are hundreds of them.The rest of the game is decent . It has good music and a good attempt to recreate Normandy , some of the levels are pretty fun . But compared to Call of Duty , which is more squad based with better weapons and realism , this game is a weak shooter .	-1
I 've read all the good reviews on this game and just ca n't bring myself to jump on board the bandwagon . I 'm a pretty experienced gamer who just does n't see any big deal about this FPS.The pros : Good graphics , decent sound , sometimes immersive gameplay . On some levels you ride vehicles for a change of pace . Lots of levels.The cons : Cliched missions , heavily scripted AI , constant saving/reloading during certain missions , average weapon selection , below average multiplayer experience . Difficulty curve increases dramatically after the first few missions.My biggest complaint with the single player game is some very obvious `` cheap AI '' and corresponding `` cheap '' graphics programming/level design . The game starts out very promising , with a gradual difficulty curve but eventually becomes an extremely tedious trial-and-error save & load ; game process in the later levels.The Omaha beach level might seem at first to be an exciting , panicked charge up the beach to storm the bunkers , but after a few tries you realize it 's nothing more than a timing maze puzzle as you run from barrier to barrier to prevent yourself from getting hit by unstoppable machine gun fire.The sniper-city level is incredibly frustrating , as you must literally inch from spot to spot and pixel-hunt every angle and every shadow in the drab , grey backgrounds for equally grey enemy snipers , most of which are perfectly accurate and completely immobile , and sniping you from spots you can not reach yourself . Though proponents of the game might argue this to be a realistic simulation of city warfare , the rest of the game is not paced this way , and realism is n't a factor anywhere else . It also might sound challenging at first , but in the end it 's a continual load/save trial and error process that grows tiresome after the first 15 or 20 tries . You do n't even get a muzzle flash to determine the direction the hits come from , and a handful of snipers seemingly hit you through walls or ( after you find them and then retrace your steps ) at angles you realize you could have never seen them . It 's an artificial way to increase the length of this otherwise boring level.Later levels combine each frustrating part of the previous levels , and add extra `` lame '' touches , such as fog ( disguised as a snowstorm ) that you must slowly inch through to prevent being ambushed from machine gun nests and the scripted enemy positions.There 's a vehicle-based level where you get to drive a big tank around , and it starts out promising . Sadly , it is also artificially made longer than it should be due to the fact that you have to shell every building you see - and it takes time for you to reload your gun after each shot.Regardless of any open-looking level design , there 's only one path through each level , with things such as a low fence or small pile of rubble impeding your ability to sneak up behind enemies.The programmers should have spent more time improving the charge-then-squat AI routines instead of making each level artificially difficult by blending the soldiers into the background or adding dense fog to prevent you from strategically plotting your next move . Soliders may hit alarms if you wound them but do n't notice when you blow away the guy 10 feet from them with your Thompson . There are a few missions where stealth is suggested but there 's little need for it.If you 're looking for a more action related WW2 based FPS , grab Return to Castle Wolfenstein . For a much better WW2 Multiplayer FPS , grab BF:1942 . Grab this one when it shows up in the bargain bin at your local game store .	-1
The game is great if you can get it to work . The success rate for that is horrific . It does not seem to mater what your system is based on - AMD , Intel , VIA , etc . Your chances are about 50/50 . Six other folks I work with have purchased this game . Only 2 got it to work right out of the box . Two others got it to work with a lot of sweat and tears and then to find it fail later in the game ( audio looping problems ) . The remainder gave up and returned the game . I wish I would have done the same.Support for this game is slow in comming . EA hast left it to you to debug their software and find work arounds for the numerous problems . I advise two things:1. log on to the MOHAA site and check out the user forums . It will give you a good idea of what you may face.2 . Do n't purchase this game until EA comes out with a major patch to resolve the problem.Good luck .	-1
This would be a five star review if only the program would run for more than 5 minutes . I 'm running on a 1GHz P3 , 256M RAM , ATI Rage 128 . The demo runs fine but the full program does n't like the video card because it keeps causing it to send an invalid signal and I have to reboot . I have the latest drivers . I do n't have this problem with any other games.If you have the same video card as me , I do n't recommend this game .	-1
MOHAA is a game that is ideally suited for the person who gives no regard for even the slightest bit of realism and decent storyline . Essentially , this game is a slowed down Quake with Germans and Allies instead of Marines and monsters ... . I knew this was not going to be a Ghost Recon , Operation : Flashpoint , or World War II Online , but its pathetic , and made me remember why I gave up console games so long ago . Not even a hint of realism here.MOHAA makes me think of the movie Kellys Heroes where the Americans march right through German lines and single handedly kill hundreds of soldiers , only this isnt even comparable to the movie because its so bad ! OK , the game 's graphics are really nice . Not on the scale of Ghost Recon , but still nice . Maybe if the soldiers were n't so dumb and you at least had a little control over them it would be slightly better , but you don't.I really can not recommend this game to anyone except hard-core teenage Quake players . I bet it will sell a ton , because the gaming community has very low standards for success at the moment . Ill stick with Ghost Recon , Flashpoint , and WWIIOL for now . Hopefully you will check those out if you want good , fun , realistic games .	-1
5 of my friends and myself have bought this game ... it only works for 1 of them ! ! ! THis game constantly crashes for my friend that it works for ! WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY ! !	-1
Do yourself a favor and pass on this game . It 's neither a good golf game or tycoon game . While you will initially have fun with this game the repetitiveness of it all will quickly bore you , it 's just not a good game .	-1
The demo for this game { if one could call it that ) was on the Sims Hot Date , or some expansion for the Sims . It seemed pretty fun , and since they restricted you to 3 courses , I really wanted to know what it was like to build a big golf resort . And so , I got caught in the trap . I went out and bought Sim Golf ... The worst waste of money in my life . I quickly became bored with the different buildings ( there are so few ! ) , and although the course building tool was kind of interesting , it was far from addicting ... The actual golfing aspect of the game required no skill , and the houses you build for celebrities are a plain waste of time ... It is a plain waste of time , money , and of course , megabytes . I ca n't wait 'till the Sims Superstar comes out ... Do n't make the same mistake I did , and get a better game . This is just a plain disgrace .	-1
The game looks very good for gamers that like to play on settings of very hard . Unfortunately , I am not that good . Because there are not 5 difficulty levels from very easy to very hard and even on the & quot ; Easy & quot ; setting I can not get through the missions I am unable to play the game .	-1
I bought this game expecting something similar in quality to Novalogic 's `` Delta Force LandWarrior '' game . What I got was a system-devouring , buggy crash-fest.The game installed without incident , and I played the first mission without too much consternation ( why does the mission suddenly stop when most of the bad guys are down ? No mopping up allowed ? I took off from the base , ca n't I find my way back and land ? ) but the next mission had too many tanks or planes I guess.At first , the game turned into `` Commanche 4 : The Slide Show '' , then it crashed -- Ka-Boom ! I realized that when I came over a particular hill during this mission at a particular angle of attack , the game would have a stroke and start locking up . If I ran into another chopper ( one appears in the distance ) , the game would brain-freeze . I have been playing alot of graphically intense programs lately with no problems , I have a Geoforce2 card , 512MB of RAM and a P4 machine ; so what is the problem ? ? Who knows . The graphics in this game are'nt that hot , the gameplay would be almost worth it , if Commnche 4 worked properly . I WANT MY MONEY BACK ! Buy the `` Commanche Vs . Hokum '' game instead , it is MUCH better : a realistic flight model , better controls and it does'nt gobble up your computer or stop the sim when it thinks you 're finished playing .	-1
This game is extremely annoying for two reasons . First , it gets extremely laggy sometimes for no apparent reason . Also , the AI is not fun to play against . The AI is extremely fast because it does n't have to use the mouse . However , the AI is also really stupid , and it does n't have a good strategy , even on the hardest difficulty . So , playing against the computer is not fun .	-1
If you want to get your computer to get broken or get a hard drive problem , get this game . This game was really fun and all , but after 2 months , it crashed my computer . I had to pay $ 150.00 dollar 's to get it fixed . So if you DONT'T want to get your computer broken , Do n't get the game .	-1
Flight Simulator 2002 is a good game but when you fly the planes you do nothing . You just end up crashing because theres nothing to do in the game . One plane wont even get off the ground . I dont know why they put that plane in the game .	-1
Ok , I admit Flight Simulator is a great program . I have bought Flight Sim 98 , 2000 Pro , and now 2002 Pro . Each program is better than the last , but only slightly . I find the ATC feature sort of cheezy . I expect they will fix this in a hurry though by the next version.The Frame Rate has increased with the new version , which is a delightful surprise . The scenery appears pretty much the same with the exception of randomly appearing and disappearing buildings.The packaging is ... . All I got was a box , pamphlet , program , and CD envelope ( not even a jewel case ) . The Quality is no longer there as with previous Microsoft products . If you have ( or ever ) purchased Microsoft Train Simulator , you 'll know what I mean.If you do not own a Microsoft Flight Simulator , I recommend buying it . I do n't however , believe [ it is ] is worth it simply as an `` upgrade '' . Stick with Flight Sim 98 or 2000 until they develope an upgrade worth paying for .	-1
Well you got ta give the game some credit , for its orginality at least . I 've never seen a game like this before with a sim city view as you rescue innocent victims or chase down criminals . Now for the negatives . The game has terrible sound . The same music plays repeatedly over and over again throughout every single mission and that `` accident '' voice gets really annoying ( u 'd know if you played the game ) . Next , on to graphics . YUCK ! C'mon , the city looks like a mess of jagged lines . What a terrible sim . Then , the controls : HARD ! ! ! Do n't think you 'll ever get passed the first mission . Overall , a good rental but nothing more !	-1
If you are used to SSX and Smuggler 's Run type of graphics thisis not you game . The stly of gameplay seems slow and not very interesting , it also is a unpleasent reminder of September 11th , putting out fires in burning buildings will not get my liking or intrest for a few years .	-1
City Crisis -- 0.85 starsCity Crisis is a total waste of money . poor graphics and sound , downright horrid control . You fly helicopters around , recuing people from buildings and following criminals in high-speed pursuits . I will say that it is an original idea .	-1
Flying a Helicopter around and saving people never seemed any fun to me . It would have been better if it was a car game I think .	-1
City Crisis is a helicopter simulation where you put out fires and rescue people from buildings . You can also use the helicopter to illuminate fleeing criminals with the night sun . Unfortunately , the game has horrible graphics and even worse game play , and the missions are redundant . I 'm just glad I rented it and did n't waste more money buying it .	-1
Legends of Wrestling is not worth it at all . The game is very slow , the graphics are sub par but considering that this game is on the PS2 and XBOX , the graphics are mediocre at best . Also the gaemplay and control is awful.With fighting games like Tekken 4 , MK Deadly Alliance and wrestling games like Smackdown SYM , this series really does n't stand a chance because these games are faster , have better controls and the gameplay and replay value is great . I wo n't deny L of W has a lot of great names in it like George & quot ; The Animal & quot ; Steele , Hulk Hogan , & quot ; Superfly & quot ; Jimmy Snuka and more but still , the names in this game ca n't hold the game up.If there was any indication that this was going to be a bad wrest ; ong game , the fact that it 's released by Akklaim and as most of you remember that Akklain also had the unfortunate mishaps of having their name attached to their last wrestling games WWF Attitude and ECW Hardcore Revolution . Honestly , Akklain lost the license to release games for a reason and there are 2 right there . Skip this one and if you 're looking for a good wrestling game , check out the Smackdown series because you 'll enjoy that much more .	-1
It 's amazing to me how ACCLAIM can make a game like Warzone on the N64 and PS1 and make it a decent wrestling game . The only thing some people complained about was the controls being that of a Mortal Kombat style game , which they ignored and kept anyway when they release the games follow up of WWF Attitude . That game looked so promising and the graphics looked awesome , but once the previews where over the the released game was playable , it was possibly the biggest let down of wrestling fan gamers lives . They then lost the rights to the WWE franchise and picked up ECW , in which they pretty much did not update a thing , they just made the ECW arena and wrestlers and added a barbwire match , and that was it . It 's a no wonder ACCLAIM are not legendary amongst wrestling games . So here they are , some years after their WWF and ECW release , and a promising new game excited fans called Wrestling Legends . It 's gon na feature Hulk Hogan and Bret Hart , the Road Warriors and so many huge name legends ... but what do we get ? It 's a revamped version of Attitude/ECW ! Just with some graphical enhancements , and worse controls ! I swear to you , if you have played Attitude , you will see how simmilar this game is in graphics and maneuverability . Everyone hated that your player would n't lock onto his target and start punching the air ... well , here it is back again ! This game may as well be called ACCLAMES ATTITDUE REVIVAL because it seems they are using the same pathetic coding they where using all those years back . I really do n't get how other companies manage to make controls basic and smooth , but ACCLAIM always seem to stuff it up in just about every way possible . Moving around and connecting with hits have such bad targeting in this game , and moves , man , why is there so little amount of moves you can have with a wrestler ? Seriously , you have about 10 to choose from in each match , and they decided to put an `` excitement '' meter in the game where the crowed react to seeing new moves you have n't done yet , and it drops when you repeat moves ... ACCLAIM , why didnt you just give people the choice to be able to actually do a lot of moves , instead of use the same old c @ ppy programming you used for ATTITUDE where you kept doing the same moves over and over again because others where useless or got blocked all the time , and you expect people to be forgiving and not notice that all you did was reduced the move abilities and added a meter to say , `` hey , try doing a different move that the controller is too stiff on to be able to execute '' Ah Acclame , you have n't done it again.I do n't particularly ever want to turn this game on ever again . So I ca n't tell you how many matches there are , or what options you can do , because after 5 matches fighting the same guys in career mode , and winning the belt , I still was going back and forth between Texas and somewhere else doing ugly looking shows against the Von Eric family all the time ... which I learned my lesson with previous ACCLAIM wrestling games to not bother finishing it , as ACCLAIM have no imagination when it comes to these sort of things , and you just do the same thing over and over a million times until you are presented with something boring like unlocking 1 wrestler , and having to do it over and over again with other wrestlers just to unlock them all ... no thanks ACCLAME , not doing that ever again to be rewarded with nothing in the end , especially when it 's so boring after an hours play , and you expect people to play it for days to weeks doing the same no variety matches ? Forget it .	-1
This game is very short you can finish it in a few hours . One player missions are fun but two player is flat out boring ... Enjoyed it for 8 hours ... Found my self thinking that they developed a few levels then quit before they had a full blown game . ... you should get at least 5-7 days of play time instead of 5-7 hours .	-1
I really hated this game for many reasons . Here are some pros and cons : Pros : - uhhhhhh ... ( i guess the graphics are ok ) Cons : - No freedom . There is a track you have to follow , but you have to do missions and kill people along the way . Does n't really make sense.- No weapons . For a game with no freedom , like this one , you would think they would try to spice it up with some cool weapons or something . Nope . All you have is a machine gun and a regular gun.- I do n't get why your car turns into a motorcycle when your life is low.- Controls are too complicated . While you are going really fast and trying to complete missions , you have to add more confusion switching your weapons . You would think only having two weapons , it would be easy to switch , but no.This game really does n't deserve to be a Playstation Greatest Hit . Sorry if I offended any SpyHunter fans .	-1
I love nfl blitz games except this one and here is why . Bad AI on your team sometimes they just stand their when they have a good chance for a sack . Changing players take to long so good sacks are rare . 2003 is abetter version	-1
it sux . never get it . u just hop around getting smashed by things . i played it once and hated it . im srry for the ppl who have it ! ! !	-1
I 'm surprised this got an Editor 's Choice , I 'll be a bit more wary of that label now.If you 're looking for anything like the original frogger , this is *not* it.I 'm about 4/5 done , and the only reason I continue to play is to finish and shelf the cartridge . The game play is repetitive and dull . After playing the first level , you 've pretty much seen all it has to offer .	-1
IN a word , aweful . Despite all the hype before it was released , this game is the pits . Why ? The controlls are jerky and annoying , the camera gets stuck and lost , you can not save during a board , the cutscenes are unintelligible , it is pointlessly hard -- I must have spent 2 hours trying to jump on a railing to ring a bell the railing was right in front of me but since he hops , it is purely random , lastly THE GAME GETS CONSTANTLY STUCK -- for example , if you jump from under an island ( and you spend most of your time swimming ) you get stuck inside the graphic of the island , and there is no escape ! ! ! And since you can not save the game during a board , just at the end , if you get stuck on a puzzle , or trying to jump on a railing , or to keep from getting stuck in computer limbo , it is purely maddening ! ! ! Instead , try Jak and Daxter ( I am not a developer or in any way affiliated with any game company ... etc.. ) The most fun I 've had since I first played Spyro the Dragon ! ! WHen oh when is there going to be a new game for PS2 ... . I can not recommend Jak and Daxter enough -- everything this game gets wrong , it gets right.If you rented Frogger , you would stop playing after an hour.I 'm sure there is a worse game for PS2 , but I ca n't think of what it could be	-1
a BIG disappointment ... ..frogger is practicly impossible to control , the graphics are grainy , I never get headaches from playing a video game but this one will give you a migrain ! the extreme jerky movements and the way the view gets thrown off from the slightest odd jump will make you want to smash this game ! not to mention the `` story '' ... all it is ... '' once upon a time there was a frog who rescued a princess from some goblins and when she kissed him he turned into a prince '' so un-original ! also there is only 5-6 hours of game play ! and most of this is running around trying to find out what on earth you are supposed to do ! but the worst turn off is the errors . this is what I mean by they did n't finish it ! you will often find your self stuck in some invisible wall usually the sounds go bonkers , or you wait there until some enemy finishes you off . another one is enemies getting stuck in wood , rock or something so you ca n't kill them and again the sound goes bonkers . but the worst of all is when the game totally freezes ! then you have to re-start your ps2 and of course the game ... .I gave it 2 stars only because it had some OK game play but it deserves 0 .	-1
Not this ! If you are looking for a game . Do not get this ! It has horrible controls and camera , lots frame-rate slowdown , extremely short , and it has a bad plot . So if someone says they want or bought this game your reply should be not this ! The one good thing is there are 80+ characters .	-1
I fail to see how Konami could release such a terrible game . Do n't even think about renting it because you will want your money back . It 's terrible with a capital T. It has the word bad written all over it . Do n't even bother to look at the cover , stay far away .	-1
I rented this because Frogger was my wife 's favoriate game on PS1 . We were excited to play this . After about an hour , it was back in the case . This is NOTHING like the PS1 model , it is a direct rip-off of Mario Brothers in 3-D . But it 's not even as good as Mario . It 's just a frog running around trying to get as many coins as possible.If you like Mario Brothers , you 'll like this . It 's a good choice if PS2 is your only system.If you 're looking for what frogger is known for , you 'll have to wait until the next one .	-1
I generally have high hopes for any 3-D platform game that features toadstools and fireflies . We know that a fairly detailed and colorful 3-D world can be created on a PS ( 1 or 2 ) , and games like the three Spyro games did just that , with smooth gameplay and beautiful backgrounds . This game , however , does none of those things . Although his is a Playstation TWO game , the graphics are rather flat and lifeless , especially in the early levels , which is where you want to capture players ' interests . The potential for vivid , colorful detail on the PS2 is far beyond what this game accomplishes -- this looks more like an early PS1 game.The most frustrating part of this game has got to be its tendency to freeze up , get stuck , or block your view . Very sloppy programming . Within five minutes of starting the game , Frogger 's head was STUCK IN A BOAT while he was swimming underwater , forcing me to retart from the beginning . Then , once again about five minutes in he got stuck in MIDAIR and I had to start over again . Meanwhile , the incredibly choppy movement does not feel smooth or natural at all . I spent most of my time accidentally jumping into the water because the & quot ; jump & quot ; is fairly difficult to control . The storyline and dialogue are rather lifeless as well and I find myself turning the volume down so I do n't have to hear the same two or three lines , like & quot ; I know Frog-fu ! & quot ; over and over again.I imagine that a child playing this game would be as irritated as I am by having to start over again and again when it inevitably gets & quot ; stuck & quot ; ... and kids who have played other PS2 platformers like Jak and Daxter will probably be disappointed by the dull gameplay . Younger kids , or those who have not played the better platformers , would probably still find it enjoyable . Exploring the 3-D environments and picking up colorful gems and jewels always has a certain amount of appeal , but this is definitely a renter , and I lost interest long before my five days were up .	-1
i first got into harvest moon when looking any vampire snes games for my emulator and saw the title harvest moon , now in vampire mind met i thought something compleatly differnt . it turned out to be one of the dumest games i ever played but chould not stop . it became a lot of fun for me . the back to natuer added 1000 % more fun , more real , able to make sprites do slave work , and the girls to woo are interasting . and then the 2 after save the home land , wonderfull life as i much prefer the ps 2 version added realism to it very compleax , and magical melody is just pure fun . out of all 5 this is the only one i refuse to own and i will tell you why1 . only have a year to save the stupied town.2 . have to repeat the same year over and over again to unlock every thing.3 . cant really wu the girls4 . no point to farm actualy farming is almost pointless in the game except for extra money , you can actualy just get by with chickens.the title explains it you save the home land , or it will turn into a theam park and you lose . you have 1 year to get one of the 15 endings it is not that hard just do what you do to wu a girl in the others and you already unlocked a few endings already . the only thing i think was a interasting featuer is sell your goods to the stores your self instead of dumping into a bin and get paied the next day . just get rid of the middle guy and deliver it your self.. something that could have stayed in the futer games . other then that it is a compleat dump out of the harvestmoon games , maybe if i was not expecting more out of it and it was titled something else that was not harvst moon it would have been better for me..but it is not a compleat wast just a dissapointment there are a few good things1 . some of the endings are nice and does have a good story plot2 . when u start the year over again all ur updates , crops , money , and enhancements stay so if u had the best watering can well you keep it all 15 times u start over again ... but downside people do not know you so you have to reintroduce your self again and again and again.. gets anoying cause of no skip	-1
I 'm being a bit hard on this game because I was so disappointed . The other Harvest Moon games were much better as far as game play goes . The graphics were great - the characters looked very cute and childlike , adding to the charm of Harvest Moon . But it was a complete letdown to find that as soon as you `` save the homeland '' the year starts over back in spring ( no matter what day of year it is ) and no one in town seems to remember who you are . If you had a love interest , forget it . You have to introduce yourself to her all over again . So the idea of family life is squashed . Each time you save the town you get a new icon displayed on your saved game page . I have 3 and yet I still have n't made it to see a winter yet . You can only make a handful of recipes and they are too simple and boring . Nothing like the complex recipes that came with Back to Nature . You do n't get to decide where your crops and grass grow either . It 's already decided for you where your pasture will be , and your plots of soil are very uniformed and evenly set . I think this game will appeal more to younger children , but for the older fans of Harvest Moon , it just does n't stack up .	-1
ok , i do n't think i 'm an `` action junkie . '' i like the sims 2 , i do n't play halo 2. but this game is sloooooooooooow . after a few minutes , i was sick of it . also , no real tutorial to tell you what to do . you just wake up in a room , with a cow milker in your inventory . oh yay , i can go milk a cow ! ! ! that right there is the pinnacle of gaming entertainment , my friends ( sarcasm ) . i liked the old sega genesis harvest moon better , where you have a nice full screen , no annoying 3d cameras . you know you can water , harvest your crops , deal with your cows , go into town , etc . simpler , faster , and more fun . also this game has japanese-type graphics ( i 'm sorry , but there are a million anime titles out there , did they have to turn harvest moon into one ? ? ) and annoying townspeople that i hate . i wish i had bought harvest moon : back to nature for PS back in the day . now it costs $ 40 online , but it looks like it has that sega genesis harvest moon style that i like . definitely skip this one ! ! !	-1
After playing it for awhile , I realize all you get to do is play with cows and chickens , and a dog if your lucky . What a boar . The `` Harvest Land '' in this game is so small I wonder where all the memory went to . Your main goals are to bake goods , farm the land , then attempt to earn money that way , so you can buy something to give as a `` gift '' to some townsfolk fool . This way the townspeople will give you clues to go on stupid little adventures to get to one of nine stupid little endings to the game . Oh , and if you miss their birthday dont expect any help . Save up enough money and you can buy a kitchen for your crappy little shack , whoopie ! Im sure glad I could get $ 11 for this game when I sold it . Thats the best part of the game , getting rid of it .	-1
I regret buying this game not because is bad game at allbut because in trying to free some some memory the system erased all my save game information on all my pS2 games and reformatted the memory card . the game seems to be a good game though .	-1
I own this game , and it does n't come close to the first Harvest Moon ( Harvest Moon 64 ) ! In this game , there are no sheep , no festivals , you ca n't get married , no babies , the game ends after 1 year , and you do n't have a lot of fields to plant crops in ! The only good thing about this game is that the graphics are , I must say , the best I have ever seen ! But I do n't think the graphics are worth all that money for the game ! ! So , do n't spend your money on it ! It STINKS !	-1
This game was alright but it wasn ; t nearly as good as ANY of the other Harvest Moon games . Personally I hated it , and I'v been a Harvest Moon fan for quite some time . This game only gives you a sertain amount of time to complete . and then u start over again , with the same stuff u had ... i'v `` saved the homeland '' as many times as you could and it didn ; t seem to be/get any more interesting .	-1
This game has a great concept , lots of things to do , and a cute look . Why the low score ? Well , the in-game time system is , in a word , wack . I would barely get outside and get my bearings , and it would be mid-afternoon already ! Then , one time , I got lost trying to find a path in the `` morning '' , and by the time I found it ( a few real-world minutes later ) , it was `` night '' ! ! How am I ever supposed to build a farm and save the homeland if all the stores are closed by the time I get to them ! ? This game could have been Animal-Crossing caliber , but instead it 's just confusing and weird . Too bad . I was really looking forward to it .	-1
back in the ps2 times i used to like playing this game but know that i see it for what it is its very limited you do n't have much to doand the day ends very very very quickly giving you no time to explorer the very small town your ini have a fishing net but i cant go fishing for along timethe graphic looked good and the music hooks you in but the expertise is just bad	-1
If you want to get an HM game , get Back to Nature or A Wonderful Life . This has best or second best graphics , but not much else . The girls are pretty interesting , but you ca n't marry or date them . It does n't have holidays , it only has 4 crops , few animals , and it 's just not nearly as good as any of the other games . Rent it if you feel you must try it .	-1
If you have played with the previous Harvest Moon games , you can expect a similar experience in this version.The storyline is very simple : You have to save the town ( farm ) from being turned into a theme park.This game has not one ... not two ... not even three ... but 9 ENDINGS , Each one being different . Why so many , you may be asking ? I have no clue . The problem is that if you do n't use a stradegy guide and/or an Action Replay/Gameshark , it is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to unlock all 9 endings because you have to do specific things ( ie 1st , give a tomato to ? ? ? , then go see the Harvest goddess , etc . ) Like I said before , If you have played with the previous Harvest Moon games , you can expect a similar experience in this version . You get to raise cows , chicken , horses , dog , etc . You can even upgrade your house . There are lots of shops in the game ( maybe too many ) and lots of people to talk to.It takes FOREVER to save up money in this game . The day you get 1 Million ( whatever currency the game uses ) , pigs can most probably fly.Unfortunately , YOU CAN NOT GET MARRIED ! In every other Harvest Moon game , you can get married , even in the Super Nintendo version . This is a big disappointment.The graphics are cell-shaded . This game would have looked great in regular 3-D. Why could n't they make this game regular 3-D ? Once again , I have no clue.Also , when it is nighttime in the game , it is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to see.Overall : This game is only for hardcore Harvest Moon gamers and PS2 game collectors ( this game can be hard to find ) . Even if you like Harvest Moon but are not a hardcore Harvest Moon gamer , do n't even rent this game . I like Harvest Moon , but this is a huge disappointment . Unfortunately , this is the only Harvest Moon game available for PS2 . I give this game a 2 out of 5.Second Opinion : 3/5 stars : This game is a disappointment to the Harvest Moon series , however nonetheless it is a lot of fun .	-1
I was curious about this game . My brother loved the pc version and loads of people have been raving about in the reviews so I bought it for the PS2 eagerly opened it and started playing . I have to admit I did n't even get past the first level . The movement is horrible , I was expecting something as well done as Red Factions movement . The frame rate drops constantly . To put it another way , it felt like I was playing a first person shooter that predates Doom ( for any of you who do n't know , Doom was one of the first first person shooter games ever ) or it seems like a first person shooter done on the original playstation . It seems like this port was half done and was relying on the popularity of the PC game to sell it . So as not to be totally negative I did think it was a cool story and that you could make decisions in the game that affected how the game progresses , but unfortunatly a game can not be considered good just b/c the story is good . If you are still considering buying this half finished game , I 'd suggest you rent it first or buy it for the PC ( there are even adapters so you can use your PS2 controller with a PC now ) . If this were the first PS2 game I ever played I would have gotten a gamecube of xbox .	-1
So , this game , or more specifically its PC predecessor , is a masterpiece in the history of the genre . At least , that 's what people say . I 'll never know . The controls on this version of Deus Ex were so complex and awkward that I found them frustrating , and , consequently , the game was a miserable experience . I 'm not much of a FPS player , but there is a huge difference between intuitive controls ( e.g. , Halo ) , which are possible in ANY game , regardless of the overall complexity of the in game actions and the completely awkward , counter-intuitive , and ultimately frustrating control scheme that defines the gameplay in the PS2 version of Deus Ex . Are the controls an unavoidable result of its conversion from PC to console ? Probably not - plenty of other games have been ported and have still been wonderfully playable . Oh well ; it 's a shame I 'm missing what sounds like a really interesting game , but I have better things to do than spend hours training on and acclimating myself to a poorly designed control scheme .	-1
For some reason when I asked DS items to be listed , this game boy advance item was in the list , and I did not realised until too late . Amazon searching system failed me .	-1
First off , this game is extremely tedious because the colors are so friggin dark , you can barely tell the difference between the ground and a hole . Also , When sneaking past prefects , it 's so dark that you would run into one thinking it 's a wall all the time . Second , in the obsticle courses and trials , if you are very far , but die , you have to start all over again with everything back the way it was , unmoved . Third , there is only one boss , and he is very easy . There are more problems with this game , but I do n't want to write them all . Overall , DO N'T BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU HAVE TONS OF MONEY TO SPARE ! ! !	-1
This game is fun until you get to the flying lesson.Hootch'sconstant & quot ; Concentrate , potter , and try again'make you want togo over and strangle her.Going through all those hoops makesyou feel like you 're a trained animal going through endlesshoops to entertain Hootch.Flying through 20 hoops was annoyingenough , but having to fly through 40 hoops ? Come on now-fortyhoops ? It gets boring having to keep flying through hoops constantly , and it 's a waste of time.If you have this game and can not get past the flying lesson , I suggest you put ituntil Game Shark Video Game Enhancer comes out with codesfor this game .	-1
This game is one of the best ive ever played . But , its too short . I beat it in 3 hours without trying . Also , there isnt much walkthrough or a map so u dont know where ur going . Dont get me wrong , this is the BEST game ive ever played , buts its easy . ON the BAD side , you cant pass the cut scenes . The Cut scene on the last level is 5 minutes long . And u have to see it EVERYtime u challenge valdamore ( i dont read the harry potter books , so i dont know wats his name ) Luckily , i only needed 3 chances to beat him . He is VERY hard but not frustrating , just challenging . I heard that Harry potter and the chamber or secrets is coming out , i hope that its the same great graphics and everything , just alittle harder . Anyways , RENT IT BEFORE U BUY.IF U GET TO THE LEVEL WHERE U MEET HAGRID , THEN UR ABOUT HALF WAY DONE . IF U GOT THERE IN LESS THEN AN HOUR AND A HALF , THEN DONT COSIDER BUYING THIS GAME CUASE ITS TOO EASY.DONT GET ME WRONG , ITS THE BEST GAME , JUST TOO EASY .	-1
I really hoped that the PlayStation game would be a great one . After I saw the movie , I decided to buy the game , cuz it sounded neat . Well ... the game is a bit disappointing . I expected much more than Harry running around , trying not to be late for class , casting spells , etc . But that 's practically ALL that he does . The beginning of the game was interesting , but then you start trying to collect beans , run ... errands , blah-blah-blah . Even thought I LOVE platform/adventure games , this did n't work out for me . I got to 60 something % and just quit . It was a bit challenging after the beginning , but then it just got WAY to easy and short , so I dropped this game and choose Ape Escape . Now , Ape Escape is a WAY better game than Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone , so if you want a great platform game , choose APE ESCAPE ! And the Harry Potter movie was better than the game , so either just watch the movie or rent it , DO N'T BUY IT !	-1
Soldier of Fortune for the PS2 is a very bad first-person shooter . You can play single player offline or multiplayer online or with BOTS . I played offline , but I doubt that it makes much of a difference since SOF has many technical problems.This game is barely worth my time . Soldier of Fortune for the PS2 should have been beta tested , so it would not turn out this bad . This is simply of one the worst games currently out for the PS2 . It is an insult to the pc version of Soldier of Fortune . The pc version had clean graphics , fast framerate and great sound effects . The PS2 version has none of those things . My biggest gripe about this version is the very crappy frame rate , it is pathetically bad ! It has some of the worst graphics to date on the PS2 ! You 'll see this strange folding effect on the screen ; as if someone is tugging at it , because the graphics can not keep up with the action on screen.Not only does it look horrible but the choppy frame rate will also affect your game play . If someone is shooting at you from the upper level and you want to aim your cross- hairs up , it takes a couple of seconds too long and then you are either dead or the enemy gets away . The aiming controls can barely catch up to the target in time and this is very frustrating.Just imagine an internet game with tons of & quot ; LAG & quot ; , and then you 'll understand what I mean . The graphics and colors look muddy and drab ( even the SNES games look better ) . Animation is jerky and the characters look strange when they run around shooting . SOF also had clipping problems ; in some areas I spotted enemies because their arms or legs where showing through walls . Loading the game takes forever ! You can go have a cup of coffee and it will still be on the loading screen ! Then when SOF finally loads you 'll be treated to every bad thing that a PS2 game can have wrong.The one good thing about the graphics was that it was able to keep the blood and gore from the pc version- you can still blow people 's heads , arms and legs off . And I liked the fact that they included BOTS in multiplayer and you can play against them by yourself . Are the BOTS any good you ask ? Well they have a tendancy to shoot you in the back very often and they seem to have better shooting accuracy than you , but they do n't have any real strategy . They basically run and shoot a lot mindlessly . But the action is never exciting because of all the & quot ; LAG & quot ; .The frame rate is laughably bad ( like a bad joke ) . Playing Single player is even less fun and I got ticked off by one of the levels where you ride on a moving train . My character got stuck in the railing a couple of times and the enemy cpu got me with a lot of cheap shots . I found a few other places where my character got stuck to a door and the enemy came and blew me away . That 's just bad programming . If they had done a better job of beta testing SOF , this would not happen . The controlling is not bad but it needed to be more responsive ( especially when aiming ! ) The sound of effects are weak and unrealistic . The sound of gun fire from each weapon is very inaccurate and sound cheap . The Shotgun sound is too loud for its own good . Grenade explosions also sound weak as do machine gun fire . However , the music is pretty good as are the screams from enemies when you blow them away.In conclusion SOF is plagued by everything that could go wrong in a game of this type and you are better off buying something else . I feel sorry for the people that buy this game and then they ca n't get their money back . So I hope they listen to me when I say this : Soldier of Fortune for the PS2 is total junk . I suggest many other first person shooter games that are much better and enjoyable than SOF . Games like : & quot ; Timesplitters 1 and 2 & quot ; , & quot ; Medal of Honor & quot ; , & quot ; Red Faction 1 and 2 & quot ; & quot ; James Bond Nightfire & quot ; . Those games will leave Soldier of Fortune in the dust bin- where it rightfully belongs !	-1
It 's graphic violance is about all this game has going for it . The graphics are poor , the scenary does n't change much , and you get bored fast . This is diffenetly down at the lower end of combat games on the market for PS2 .	-1
I wo n't go into reviewing this game very long so I 'll make it short . This games graphics suck ! I have scene better graphics then this and this is from the PC I mean c'mon ! The graphics are terrible compared to the PC.I hated how bad the frame rate was and everything about the graphics were really really bad.The violence in this game are hardcore but the pc Version is better mainly cause of the graphics.I 'm so glad I returned this I just could n't handle the bad controls and graphics . I mean I donno I just did NOT like the game compared to the PC version which is better.In short ... Get the pc version1 out 5Lates	-1
This is a bad title . Spyro games always used to be fun , but that tradition ends here . Camera angles are bad , the grpahics are very dark , and the whole thing is just another lame kiddie game .	-1
I dont recommend this game at all , the graphics are nice at first but get boring , the game flat out sucks , the only reason i even gave it two stars is because i know how long it takes to make a game , and i of 14 couldnt even figure the damnb this out , its confusing as hell , and i didnt even want to play it because nothing drew me to it .	-1
I have all the Spyro games for PS1 & PS2 , and I LOVE them , so when I got my GBA I bought Season Of Ice right away ... .and was very annoyed . At first I thought it would be cool , because there are fairies and mermaids , but the controls are much more difficult on the GBA than the Playstations . I have trouble getting Spyro to go the direction I want him to , especially on diagonals . I think it 's because you 're using directional buttons instead of a joystick . I do n't think it can be the fault of the button on my individual GBA , because I bought it brand new and this is one of the first games I 've played on it . Anyway , I have trouble crossing bridges and just moving around in general ; it makes it incredibly obnoxious , because every time you fall in water you die . I say , if you have a Game Cube and a Game Boy Player ( so you can use a joystick ) this could be a great game , but if you just have a GBA , do n't bother , it 's more frustrating than it 's worth .	-1
This Game was terrible . The only new thing about this game was that Coco was fully playable but you do n't get to play as her very often anyway.Here 's an overall view of the game : The Positives : -Good Graphics-Good Bosses-New VehiclesThe Negatives : -Sucky Levels ! -Sucky Music-It takes about a hour to load-The Game is extremly hardI heard there is a new Crash coming out later this year . All I can say is that I hope it will be good .	-1
Have you ever gotten home and wanted to play that one game that you just got a new code for , do n't do that with this game . Unless that code makes the game load faster this game is annoying . If this was the first game I played on the PS2 I would have returned the PS2 , and gotten a Game Cube or X Box . The graphics are not that great , and I hate the controls . When controlling Crash you feel like you are in a BMW M5 convertible that can only go a top speed of 30mph because of an engine problem . Everything about this game is slow . I wonder if the people who made this game were slow in the head . Other than that the game is fun . It is another Crash game , nothing special . But the loading kills the fun .	-1
Games , like every form of entertainment , are subjective so I would never tell anyone not to at least try something out . I came really close this time . Lets start with the load time -- this practically cripples the game and makes the whole experience annoying . The graphics , though not a big deal since really this game is for those into the CB series , did not impress me . Movement of the characters has an annoyingly N64 like feel to it . This was my second attempt at getting into the CB series and I think it will be my last . Those into the series , which I am not , may find something appealing about it although I 'm not sure what .	-1
Remember when Crash Bandicoot used to be fun ? Here comes a new generation of Crash ! Apparently his new developers thought that `` fun '' is a bad thing . So they `` improved '' on the old one by making HUGE load times , terrible controls , and repeated everything WAY too much . The only fun things where hardly ever presented . If you have any other crash game . ANY at all , you do n't need this one . It 's just to boring .	-1
Anyone remember back when Chuck Jones had created the successful & quot ; Road Runner & quot ; cartoons for WB , then WB shut down the studio ... and later on , WB changed their minds , decided that they wanted more & quot ; Road Runner & quot ; cartoons after all ... and got other artists to do them other than Chuck Jones himself ? Remember how flat and terrible those new ones were compared to the original classics ? Longtime fans of & quot ; Crash Bandicoot & quot ; will experience the same problem here.While it 's true that the game is impressive on a technical level , it falls on its face concerning the actual character animation . The most appealing part of the Crash games , the wonderful cartoon visuals , look simply awful . Crash moves stiffly now and has none of the charm and charismatic appeal he showed in the earlier games . I swear , he looks and moves like a hunchback ! Also , the facial expressions are stiff , his actions and movements are puppetish & quot ; just put him through the motions & quot ; mechanics , and he simply does n't & quot ; live & quot ; . The other characters are all animated the same way , and it kills the visual appeal.I wo n't complain about the obvious & quot ; loading time & quot ; problem , as it 's already been discussed.As for the gameplay , while it would have been fun even though it 's & quot ; same old , same old & quot ; if the animation was designed better , coupled with crude animation its lifeless.All is not lost , however -- the wonderful Game Boy Advance title more than makes up for this mishap . But you 'll most likely want to skip the PS2 version . Wait for the next one and see what happens to the concept then , and hope ...	-1
