There are three different versions of the song . The game itself keeps her occupied as everything she clicks on does something ! There is an airplane that flies around the room , a telephone that rings and is plays a message , the lamp turns off the light and you see the monkeys eyes going up and down in the dark , a dog that barks when you click the window and then chases a cat out from under the bed every third time , the picture on the wall becomes an interactive portrait , the traffic light stops/starts the monkeys jumping , alarm clock rings , plant grows ( and produces bananas ) , ball bounces , toy truck rumbles and honks ... . lots to keep a toddler occupied ! Oh ! The monkeys jump on and fall off the bed ! Mama calls the doctor , etc ! It 's great .	1
This app is wild and crazy . Little ones love singing the song about Five Little Monkeys , in this app it is available in country , rock or pop . It is full of action with the player controlling most of it but it has a lesson included .	1
Very cute , with alot of items to move about . Would be awesome if the & # 34 ; dr. said & # 34 ; was in a different voice and moved too .	1
WELL THE CHILDREN LOVE IT AFTER AWHILE YOU GET TIERD OF IT BUT AS LONG AS THE GRANDCHILDREN LIKE IT YOU LISTEN TO IT	1
My granddaughter really loves this . She will listen to all 3 types of music with it and is not yet tired of it .	1
this is a very good app and it you need this service then this is the app for you to enjoy .	1
If you pay for the subscription then by all meens get this App . It works well and I love the service . I have a family of 4 and we all use it under one price .	1
I have been a therapist fan for years . it ' s a great product . download as many songs as you want each month . super quick and easy . affordable .	1
It allows me to access Rhapsody on my Kindle which I would not be able to do without the app .	1
I had Rhapsody acct . on my computer before I bought my Kindle Fire . It os very easy to use to find songs , vocal groups , or genres of music and the dowhloads are fast and easy to transfer to mp3 players or the Kindle Fire .	1
I had Napster before it changed to Rhapsody . I love Napster . being to listen to any music genre I 'm in the mood for no matter where I am.I would recommend this product to anyone who likes music . The monthly plans are also very reasonable .	1
I happen to like the country genre , and the music sounds are unbeatable ! I believe this would true with any genre that you might like !	1
I like it cause the music can be saved and stored in rhapsody song match and if you have an account with them your music is automatically saved .	1
Excellent source for music if your willing to pay for the service . If you 're looking for music give it a try , they give you a free trail . If you do n't like it you can always look elsewhere .	1
I have used this music source for a number of years and overall , they have a good variety ranging from Jack Hylton to Frank Sinatra to Black Ghosts . The only problem I had is that I had to keep the Caffine app on in order to get more than 30 seconds of a song which I found a little frustrating . Still , a great way to hear some music from yesteryear and expand on your interests !	1
We ca n't get enough of Rhapsody ! I play it everyday for the entire house as we work and play . It is amazing !	1
Soo much easier than downloading music . I do n't care about the 10 bux a month subscription . I get to listen to anything from comedy cd 's by kevin hart , wheels on the bus for my son or the first beastie boys cd . It has everything .	1
I have been a member of Rhapsody now for & # 34 ; years & # 34 ; ! I believe as for a recommondation & # 34 ; years should say it all & # 34 ;	1
Every morning I wake up to an inspirational bible verse . It helps me clear my mind before a long day . I can save the verses also if I want to refer back to them in troubling times . It even works without an internet connection somehow . I was on a cruise with no internet or mobile data and i STILL received my verses . Such a blessing !	1
Remove	1
Great app . I enjoy seeing the random daily verses . The podcasts are the best . One of my favorite evangelists , Joyce Meyer , is on there .	1
Very versatile app for daily reading of the bible . Different reading plans offered . Helps me work on my daily reading . I like the fact that I do n't have to carry around a paper copy book !	1
ONLY i wish it was in other versions , like the ESV , and the NKJV ~ but this is a great study/read !	1
This app gives me the motivation needed to meet the day . A reading from the Good Book always puts me in the proper mind set .	1
I am using this app as part of my morning devotionals . Perfect combination of verse , daily Bible reading , and devotional . I have others I do , but save this for the last one as I really enjoy it !	1
This App is important to me because I can cross references it with my study Bible . It is a great App .	1
The Daily bible give me a verse to read and easy way to get to other chapters and verses . It even let me read different bible version .	1
There 's Always Time for the Daily Bible . I like this product because it 's right there at your finger tips . Great !	1
I get to listen to different messages from a long list of preachers from Joel Olsteen , Joyce Meyer and Creflo Dollar . It is a spiritual tool I tap into more than once a day . This app also allows me to search chapters or verse and it can be read to me which is hard to find ( in a human sounding voice ) .THIS IS MY GO TO APP FOR PODCASTS .	1
Use this app nearly every day . I enjoy reading it and sometimes listening to the audio version . Handy to have many translations .	1
It 's god work . enjoy not only able to read it but listen to the word too . Very good excellent book	1
My son loves this and uses it daily on his little Tablet . He has learning Disabilities and can not read well without the Tablet 's help and he enjoys reading ( or having the Bible read to him daily !	1
This app allows you to read the Bible , receive daily devtionals , and daily scriptures in the most commonly used Bible version ( atleast by me ) NLT , NKJV , and KJV . You also get to listen to podcast by today 's leading ministries ex : Joyce Meyer , Joel Osteen , Charles Stanley and etc .	1
I love how it reminds me every morning to read my daily verse . I really love it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! This Bible is made for every type of Christian .	1
I love this app . My favorite part is getting the reminder for the daily Bible verse in the morning . I also like being able to hear the scriptures , so if I do n't have time to sit and read , I can be listening to God 's Word !	1
GET THIS APP ! If you desire to gain more knowledge about the Bible and to be able to do it on a daily basis , I would highly recommend this app because it keeps you on track and you can both read and listen to it either at home or in your car . This is an awesome app also because it has several great features that make it better than other similar apps . Unfortunately , you ca n't get this app for the Apple system , but if you have a Kindle or Android you are set . I highly recommend it !	1
I so love this app.I have been looking for a book that will help me memorize Bible verses easily without having to look at a page full of words . I give this app 5 stars easily .	1
There are so many different options . You can read a verse or listen to a podcast or even just read the Bible . Looking up verses is a cinch . There is also an option for audio . Great app , just genius ! ! ! ! !	1
this app works great . u can schedule it to give u one inspirational verse per day as well as choose what translation u want showing on the widget .	1
So uplifting to get a bible verse on a daily basis . Love the access to look up information when needed for bible study and the ability to have it read to you is a great feature .	1
VerseS Are Well Choosen And Mostly Just What I Need For That Day . Awesome Links To Podcasts , And A Really Good variety .	1
The podcast devotionals are great pick me ups , or when attending church is not an option . I also love the verse of the day part .	1
the best mobile Bible app that I could find.I love it . You can listen to a devotional.Please download it now .	1
I love that a quote from the Bible pops up everyday while I 'm in the middle of doing something else . It allows me to stop and reflect on the Word .	1
Overall , a pretty well made tower defense game . I found it to be quite fun , if a bit too easy on the easy settings.Things that are n't in the instructions that people ca n't seem to figure out on their own : You place power station towers to recharge your towers . 3 were sufficient for me to beat the first level.When placing a tower , you tap the location you want it , and then you can drag your finger around anywhere on the screen to fine-tune the placement . Quite brilliant , that ; it solves the problem of trying to carefully place the tower while it 's under your thumb.Enemies come from left to right on the first level . I assumed the opposite , due to the background graphic.Overall , a pretty solid game . Runs well , no crashes , no lockups , freezes , or any other negative events . Graphics are suitable to what you would expect from a bubble popping TD game.-1 star for poor instructions , not that it was n't hard to figure out ; very easy , simple game.EVO 3D , FAOTD .	1
this game is great now that its free and yes there are some issues that can be fixed but if you do n't want to pay three bucks for it then get it while its free now .	1
I played the first bubble defense game from the other market , and and enjoyed it . I admit this pales in comparison to Jelly Defense , but this is a solid game .	1
I never read game tutorials , but maybe should have with this one . It took me a while to realize that the easiest way to build new towers is NOT to drag them , but click the tower you want to build and then click the place on the map you want to build it . The game itself gives you strategy tips for the game in general during the 1st level . The only other thing you need is your brain , and it 's a decent tower defense game . The only thing that could be improved is the graphics , and a forced tutorial level that makes you place certain towers and explains what they do .	1
Dont drag just tap where you want to place . All towers have a radius so you know which ones your power station will effect ! Perfectly good tower defense game with a little common sense .	1
Standard TD game , set your various type of towers , be sure to set-up power stations to keep your towers firing and as you accumulate money you can upgrade or sell and change your towers . Different type towers are needed for different types of baloons traveling the course . Bright colorful graphics show up well on Kindle Fire . There are a dozen or more layouts and about 5 difficulty levels so lots of replay value although I feel the regular price a bit high , in other words I probably would n't have paid the price but it 's definitely a good app as the free app of the day . Thank you Amazon .	1
Love this game . Do n't let the cutesy graphics fool you . It is a lot of fun . Well worth the price paid .	1
I think people are being too harsh on this game . It 's really basic and not nearly as good as the other games out there because it 's been around a lot longer . BB Defense and BB Defense 2 were big hits back when Blackberry had some of the best smartphones on the market . Android has come a long way in the last few years and developers have made better games . Now , I will give the poor reviews credit , the developer assumes that you have already played the first version of this game , which is why there are few instructions . But seriously people , giving this game 1 star is like a 10 year old saying the original Super Mario Bros for NES was a crap game . It 's OLD people , that does n't make it bad .	1
its free today and fun to play . there are towers that shoot more than once and so I 'm upping the overall rating of this game buy giving it five stars .	1
I do n't know why people do n't like this game . It does n't really come with an instruction manual , though . But its very entertaining , very fun . I love playing this . HOURS of entertainment . Love , Love , LOVE it ! Ok , but I have to say one thing . Its not really worth three bucks . Well ... yeah it IS ! LOVE IT	1
To all those who are morons try reading the instructions . It is a simple but fun game . My whole family likes to play this game . My 8 year old really enjoys it .	1
This app worked well for what it was . Smartphones seems to run slower every day and this was an easy way to shut everything down without turning the phone off . By turning off all of the programs , I seemed to notice a battery life increase , also .	1
great application when you are low on memory press the app and automaticallyfrees some memory . or when your device is feeling sluggish . i have this app on all my past phones and now on my Android tablet Impression .	1
Fast Reboot does what is says . It 's does n't actually reboot your droid , but shuts down almost every app that is running . Once done , phone will speed back up and runs great .	1
This app definitely deserves a WOW . I have been doing cryptograms for a very long time . I started with the one in the daily newspaper . Then progressed to the magazines and then to the JUMBO books and even to computer software for cryptograms . Enigma is the best . I have only had it for three days , but I have found all the settings , which sets it up to my liking . I tried two other apps , but they come nowhere near Enigma . Thanks , EC Software Consulting , Inc .	1
This game is amazing if you love cryptograms . No mistakes . No misspellings . Different puzzle every time . Challenging without being impossible . Not too easy , not too difficult . Love it !	1
If I could find the endless Fountain of Cryptograms I 'd be ecstatic but this one comes close . Great quotes and challenging ones too . Great time eater .	1
this app is great . good for nights when you 're out in a city doing a bar run , real easy to find your car at the end of the night	1
I downloaded it since its free and just to add it to my apps list , which I do everyday . I did test it out and have to say it does its intended purpose well . That being said , if you do need this app to remember where you parked , there are other issues at hand .	1
five stars to balance the idiotic reviewers . its an app that does what it says and does it well . if you don & apos ; t understand the permissions that is not the fault of the developer . and also , for the freeloaders , when was the last time you actually bought an app and support devs instead of ripping apart what they put out .	1
Definitely not an app that I use every day . I do n't need to . In those rare times that I do , it is a lifesaver . It is fantastic when you are on vacation and have to park far away from where you are trying to go and do n't know the area to be able to easily find your way back .	1
To the person wgo thought this was a stolen car finder , you & apos ; re an idiot ! This is for when you go to the mall and forget where you parked . The conspiracy theorists who say the dev steals your contacts are also idiots . Amazon does a lit of research and testing on their apps before putting them on here and ESPECIALLY when putting an app as the free app of the day . Personally , I & apos ; m super happy that this is the faotd because I & apos ; ve been wanting it , but couldn & apos ; t justify paying $ 5 for an app that I won & apos ; t use that often .	1
4.5 stars from over 1,100 ratings on Googles Android Market.\n\nRegarding the permissions , read the app description ; they are all justified .	1
First try , it worked very well for me . It used GPS satellites so you need to be outside for the best results . You use it and it acts as if your car has a homing device on it . It gets you close enough	1
I wish I had this a couple of years ago when my friend and I could n't remember or agree which side of Dodger 's Stadium we parked on . That said , my truck sticks out like a sore thumb and I usually remember where I park . The times I HAVE used it , mostly for testing purposes , it worked like a charm.I did use this when parking in some paid-parking one time . It was nice to see how long I was parked there and made sure I returned to the right place . I ca n't say it saved me money , but I do think it saved me some worry.I think four bucks is a bit steep , but I would have gladly paid four bucks that day in L.A. !	1
Why does this app need permission to install ? It should run without installing . Plus there are a ton of fake dev reviews . Also , this app is used by either the government or aliens to track us . My tinfoil hat got dented last night so I & apos ; m not sure which . Uh oh , here come the black helicopters ! Run !	1
Does what it says , love that the are apps that help people find their cars ! ! \n\nThis review is to balance out the price\/permissions\/similar-app whiny baby morons & apos ; reviews .	1
I love this app ! ! It 's not something that I 'll use a lot , but is a must for when you do need it ! I recently used it for the first time at the Georgia vs Florida football game in Jacksonville , FL . If anyone has been there , you know parking is crazy an you may be a mile from the stadium if you do n't want to pay $ 50 or more for parking , which I do n't ! I was in a new town , with cars an people everywhere , not really knowing where I was . The app marked my car perfect , an i could even see the sidewalk that was by my car on the map . The app actually showed the stadium too so I knew which direction to walk . When the tailgating party an game was over , it led me right back to my car perfectly ! ! Everyone that rode with me was highly impressed with the app , and so was I . Thanks for this awesome and helpful app ! !	1
This is one of first paid apps I obtain , due to losing my car and took t upto 2 hrs trying to remember where I park . Since having this app its no longer an issue . Also I used it as a tourist when I travel . And walking in a strange city and mark my hotel . It gets me back every time . In addition the developer is very responsive with questions or concerns , his customer service was exceptional .	1
the app does just what it says . I just don & apos ; t understand how you have a $ 30 to $ 40,000 peice of machinery that you are probably still makeing payments on , and you forgot where you put it . There are times ( like the post before me ) where I can understand , but those are rare .	1
I play golf every day in the summer , and this game is really good to practice with using different clubs and all	1
This app was a lifesaver ! We were on vacation and had no way of finding out what was on TV so this really worked and was accurate ! We did n't have to waste money buying TV Guide which costs $ 5 and runs Tuesday to Tuesday !	1
This is an easy to use app . You can quicky find out what is on . The buttons that move your forward or back to different time slots are a little small . But other than that it 's good to have .	1
Very useful to me because I do n't actually have cable so I never have any way to see if my shows are on or new . This does that and also lets you customize your channel list so you only see those you need .	1
Use it all the time on my phone and kindel . dont have a dvr box for cabel so this is helpfull . very fast and always accurate . i recomend if you do not have a set top box .	1
This is a great app , you can customize to show your fav . stations . I had tv guide and did n't care for the app . I really like this one .	1
This Tv Listing guide is another great freature Amazon has included in the Kindle Fire HD ! ! The newspapers have taken away the tv guide listings and sell it separately or the print is so small you need a magnifying glass to read it and it 's only a half day.This listing is taylored to you zip code and I could n't be happier . I was considering purchasing a one year TV Guide listing for but do n't have to know and SAVED $ 65.00 ! ! ! ! The Kindle Fire HD is the best gift I 've ever gotten.Thank you Amazon and TV Listings for Android ! One delighted customer ! !	1
I liked it before the recent upgrade and I like it even better now . It was a little wonky and would n't keep channel filter settings sometimes , but it always kept my location . It 's a lot prettier after the upgrade and retains my channel settings . It opens quickly and I do n't have to make an account or sign in or fool around with anything . Awesome .	1
This is a very useful app for my Kindle Fire . My only minor complaint is that occasionally it seems to scramble times and shows . Overall , it 's worked well . It 's nice being able to see whats on at a specific time , or see the lineup for the next few shows on one channel .	1
I put it on my Kindle so I could tell my Mom what was on TV . I like that it shows the next 3 shows for each channel , plus you can choose favorite channels , so narrow down your search . I just wish the favorite channels could move up in time , like the main page .	1
I found this to be very helpful as it not only tells me whats on TV , but will also give a brief description of the show . Seeing our local paper not longer gives listings it was just what I needed .	1
This displays a TV schedule covering several hours at a glance for all channels based on your area and provider , much like an on-screen TV schedule . However , being able to see 3 shows per channel at a glance is nice and the ability to drill down to the complete schedule for any particular schedule is excellent , especially for movie or sports channels . And you ca n't beat the price !	1
Great tool to stay abreast of the 4-5 shows worth watching each week . I try to keep my boob tube watching to a minimum and this ap helps me pick the shows I actually want to watch without be mind numbed by the normal stupidity and reruns . Has just about any & # 34 ; normal & # 34 ; service provide you can think of for just about every where I 've ever traveled in the US .	1
Love the color codes for shows , sports , movies . I always use this app . saves time flipping through commercials ! Time saver !	1
Since I do n't subscribe to the daily paper , I refer to this app to see what 's on TV in the evening . It 's saved me a lot of frustration !	1
I use it many times a day . I only gave it 4 stars because nothing is perfect . This is better than looking in the newspaper or using the cable guide	1
This app works well . It gives all of the local TV listings and is correct in the details regarding local programs & reviews of the programs .	1
I really like this app . I use it all the time , even though I have a newspaper I like this because you can find out more about the program.Donna	1
works well on the kindle fire . has all my channels . very easy to cofigure and use . do n't have to turn on Tv to see what is on .	1
I use to pay for a TV Guide Magazine subscription until I found this app . This little app is excellent for those who just want to know what your listings are . It 's easy to use . You can look ahead to see what is coming on later in the day , or the next day.I would give it a 5 star rating if it were n't for the fact that the app can be buggy on occasion . But hey -- - it 's free and it 's so good in so many other ways , I 'm not going to complain too much .	1
Best app I have on my tablet . Just put in zip code and type of broadcast you are looking for and you get a complete listing .	1
Just got this as a free app . I really do like the ease of use and its speed . You can find info about over the air programs , satellite , and cable . You can narrow your search to only the channels you want.Maybe I just do n't know how to save my choices , but when I switch between satellite and over the air ( OTA ) programs I lose my selection of favorite channels . Then when I switch back to OTA I have lost those favorites , also . This is the only drawback to this app that I see . If this problem was worked out ( or if I find out how to do it right ) I would definitely give it 5 stars.This is still a good app since my TV does n't show me info on OTA programs in advance.Thanks to the developer for making this a free app .	1
We have Comcast , and when it comes to the `` premium '' ( a matter of opinion ) channels , they only list one each for HBO , Strz , etc . high definition channels . For programs in Hi Def , you have to go to `` On Demand '' for each of the premium channels.That may not make sense to you , but there is n't much sense about 900 channels to begin with . And that 's where TV Listings for Android comes in . I downloaded it to my Kindle Fire , and up popped 900 programs for every half-hour on almost every channel we get . And THAT was great except that I do n't ever watch 830 of those channels.In order to `` delete '' the channels that you do n't watch , you have to check them off and delete them one at a time . This would rate 5 stars plus if there was a way to block , say channel 300 through 699 and delete them . After that , there 's another group of 200 channels , and then I would n't mind picking out individual channels.Right now , even after some selection , when I want to see what 's on at 9 PM , I 'll get a list of 400 programs.Now , if that app would like to go a step further , I 'd like to be able to delete individual programs that I will never watch ... like Tivo .	1
LOVE LOVE THIS APP. ! ! ! ! ! I CAN NOW LOOK UP TIMES FOR MY FAVORITE SHOWS AND SEE WHICH ONES I CAN SEE AT A LATER TIME AND NOT MISS A SINGLE ONE , AND I DO N'T HAVE TO WAIT FIR THE SCROLLS ANYMORE ! !	1
IT IS VERY HANDY ... MORE THOROUGH THAN THE GRID PROVIDED ON OUR CABLE CHANNELS THROUGH THE TELEVISION SET ... ONCE AGAIN , THANK YOU FOR THIS APP	1
I have a very weird , spotty low-end cable package that makes standard listings useless . This program lets me put in only the stations I need , and is 99 % accurate even for the bizarre stations ! Love that I can get details on a listing if I do n't recognize the name of the movie , as well .	1
Since the TV Guide web page is my only source of tv listings , I was happy to find this app . It automatically opens to whatever time of day you are in and tells you what 's on . You set it up to your area and whatever channels are available to you , and that 's what you get . It lists not only what 's on each channel right now , but it also lists what 's coming up . Even with the ads , I still like it .	1
I use this daily and have found several functions ( advance listings , movies , reminders , etc ) that are helpful . TV Listing is also accurately tuned to actual programs in this area .	1
Seem to work very well . The app contains ads but they are not obtrusive . I wish the icon was less juvenile .	1
to have on my Kindle Fire . Really easy and informative to use when planning my watching schedule . I especially like the way the programming has been categorized .	1
I love this app.I am one of those people that has just about everything technology wise that you can think of ... but for whatever reason , I DESPISE using the guides onscreen on my television to see what is on.I did that , because of lack of options , but I longed for a subscription to TV Guide . However , the newest versions of TV Guide leave a lot to be desired , in my opinion.Along comes this App which I stumbled across purely by accident ... but it 's absolutely stellar.It 's like having a virtual TV Guide on my tablet and my phone . I especially like that I can filter out channels that I 'm not interested in . I have filtered out all of the shopping networks and several of the news networks , along with all of the country music channels and ALL of the `` Music playing on a blank screen '' channels.The search feature works great , and the other major feature that I truly love is the fact that you can quickly select `` Movies , Sports , or What 's On '' right from the main menu . That way you can quickly search for those several different types of items.I am giving this App five stars , but there are a few improvements that I would LOVE to see . More auto filters would be great ... such as `` Comedy , Drama , Documentary , etc . '' I would LOVE to be able to hit `` Drama '' and see which episodes of `` Law and Order '' are on at any given time.Overall , however , this is an awesome app and I 'm REALLY glad I stumbled on it.I would gladly pay a few dollars for the App if there were a paid version . Highly recommended .	1
when i first got this app several years ago I really liked it though itch was a little too simple but the latest update has really elevated its completeness ... so THANKS !	1
Easy to set up and use . It has a very simple display without a lot of junk to trying to sell stuff .	1
Love this little app . We do not always get a TV paper to check out was it on TV each evening . It is easy to pull this up on my Kindle and check it out .	1
I 've tried out several TV programming apps on both iOS and Kindle . This one is definitely the best so far . It gives you a clear listing of what 's on as well as what 's coming up in the next couple of hours , and with a tap you can zoom in on more details about the program and the channel . This is what the on-screen guide from my cable provider should look and work like .	1
I like how you can delete channels that you do n't have on your tv or choose to not watch so you can see the schedule of programs easily . You can cater it to yourself , it 's simple to use , of course I do not have cable and that may make it easier to use ? ? ? But regardless , I have no qualms with it . : )	1
I have nothing but great things to say about this app . It is accurate and easy to use . What I like best is how easy it is to see what is on a certain channel for the entire 24 hours . Using the alarm I never miss something I wanted to see . No annoying ads either !	1
I have cable with no guide and this app fills that void beautifully ! It is easy to use . I just pop into it to set the TV and back to multitasking between the droid & TV	1
The app is very helpful , and I enjoy it . However , I wish HD package listings were available for this app . Other than that , the app is great !	1
I have this on my Kindle Fire & love it . I use this to see what is on & what is coming on later so I do n't miss shows I want to watch . I use this mostly when watching TV & I do n't want to go to my computer to check on shows coming up .	1
This app is customizable for your area which is nice ! The only thing that I wish it had is a drop down to jump to a channel , rather than to scroll to it .	1
Handy app allows you to choose your TV carrier , and then view what 's coming on shortly , as well as in the future . My cable company does n't have an app for my phone yet , so this is filling the gap .	1
The old version was ok , but required lots of adjusting . The new version is pure joy to use ... it 's simple to scan and very handy ... you 'll find that you 'll be depending on this app .	1
This was a huge 5 stars app , but now I would n't give it even the 1 star that I did . On 4-4-14 this app changed . First I noticed that programming after 6:30 PM that day was not listed . Second the logo changed and the name was a little different . I tried removing it and then reinstalling it , and now I get that the app is not reading the internet . THIS IS WHY I DO N'T UPGRADE APPS. ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 24 HOURS LATER 4-5-14 THE APP IS BACK. ! ! THANK YOU ! Now it offers 7 days of programming , category selection , and better information on your selected programs.Because of the advertising window , which is still annoying , I NOW GIVE THIS APP 4 STARS. ! ! Check it out , again.IT IS MY OPINION , since this app has a new logo , a new name and new features , it should also have new reviewing stats . Which is looking like ( 2 ) 4 stars vs ( 12+ ) 1 star.My suggestion is delete this app 100 % ( device , cloud , and app library ) wait a day and then reinstall . That 's what I did .	1
This app is easy to set up for your TV area and type of connection , whether it is cable or dish . Gives good information on each program , and upcoming ones . It is great !	1
This TV is awesome . We watch television of our antenna outside so we just pick up the basic channels and this tv guide has been spot on with the shows . I am so happy I have found this guide now I do n't have to wonder what 's on tv & # 34 ; next ' .	1
I was searching for a TV guide or TV listings for the television in my bedroom only . I have a regular rabbit antenna to watch local channels . ( I do n't have directv in my room ) Now I can check the TV listings for my area and see what 's on . Works on my Kindle Fire with no problems .	1
I 've been searching for the perfect app for TV listings and I just may have found it . With the most recent update , the TV Listings by TV24 does almost everything I want . It is easy to save just the channels I want and I can select a specific program to get more details . Two more things would make this the all-time most perfect app : 1 ) Provide an option to view in a grid ( my personal preference ) and 2 ) Allow the ability to open the app on a computer to print the listings to share with the family.Great job ! I plan to tell everyone I know about this app !	1
Was looking to find a easy way to see whats on tv at a glance . Works better then any other apps . Set it up to your area and then remove the channels you do n't want and then whenever you bring it up its all up to date and ready to go . Works well on my fire . Would reccommend to anyone who ca n't always keep track of there favorite shows . Tells you what the episode is about and if its an old or new episode . Love it !	1
This tv listings is the greatest . Lots better then the old one . Thanks for doing a better job . As l stated the word needs repeating Awesome ! ! !	1
This is great to use and see all the channels and shows that are coming on in one compact place . I have it on my kindle and love it .	1
It 's simple , straight and down to the point ! does what it says , works great on the fire ! overall great app !	1
I like to always know what 's on TV , and this app is perfect for that . The type of cable that I have has a 'guide channel ' instead of one you can scroll through , and it circles through each of the channels VERY slowly . The music on this channel is also SO annoying , so I really wanted to find a way that I could just quickly look through the channels to find something good . I found a website that worked okay ( titanTV ) but many of the channel numbers or programs were often incorrect . I got this app just on the off chance that it would work better , and it DOES ! It 's so easy to use , and ( thus far ) everything it 's said has been right . Fabulous app ; a must for any avid TV watcher .	1
Keeps me updated on all my intended shows I plan to watch . Sometimes I 'm looking for a special program , and this app tells me the time and channel it will be on . Recommend to anyone just to save guess work on what programs are playing when .	1
What more could I ask for ? the interface is simple enough for even me ! Beats amy other offerings hands down .	1
I like this app but I think it should give details about the show also it should show what season and episode the show is .	1
We have an OTA antenna for the local HD channels and you can pick and choose which channels you get , what order you want them in . Much nicer than just & # 34 ; channel surfing & # 34 ; . The new ( updated ) app is well laid out and easy to navigate and read .	1
If your Tv is n't large enough to read the digital guide form where you are , there is , literally , no alternative ( not printed on paper ) . Truly intuitive , efficient and complete . It is , by far , my most used application . I am very grateful to have received my Fire as a gift from my wife and to discover this application , just as the void of a Tv guide solution was needed . I have 100 csble channels and am lucky to find one thing worth watching within a 24 hour period . This app gives you the best possible chance of finding that one episode . My only suggestion would be to add ratings to help search for new favorites - something we all value infinitely on Amazon . That was , everytime they cancel the only show that does n't suck ( e.g . Prime Suspect , Lie to Me , Medium , etc . ) t will be helpful in watching for a new replacement .	1
Finally an app that properly supports gps and ota ( over the air ) broadcasts . Wonderful and lets you delete channels you do n't watch like shopping and spanish channels . A+ app !	1
We are cutting back on our cable cost -- using Amazon Prime , HULU plus , and Netflix for tv/movies , and cutting down to the lowest tier of cable ( until we get an antenna installed ) and getting Ooma reduces our cable cost by $ 100 per month . With the lowest tier of cable -- basic reception -- you do n't get the on-screen tv grid . This APP is a fine substitute .	1
Its easy to use and set up . Im editing my review as this app is the best tv channel guide I have found . This one is a keeper . I recommend this app . To be fair , there was twice a problem with it updating the listings , but I figure just as any program , nothing is perfect , but this one is very close to it ! Samsung Galaxy s ii t989	1
Since I do not have cable TV , and our local newspaper only lists evening and night programming , I needed a way to tell what was on TV . This app fit the bill exactly ! ! I can even look ahead , and get a synopsis of the show . Thanks !	1
Love being able to check to see if my show is new . Very quick and convenient . Can easily customize to your cable network .	1
I have basic cable as I do n't watch a ton of tv , and to use my cable guide takes forever to scroll through the hundreds of channels . I installed this app and hid all channels I do n't have or do n't want to watch and now only see my channels . Great app for looking ahead and planning any movies , etc . too !	1
This game really got me into Sudoku . It was a good way to keep busy and work that mind all in your palm .	1
I 've tried a few different Sudoku apps , but this one has great features ( highlighting , flash on complete , auto-pencil for when you 're stumped , etc ) that I 've not seen elsewhere and really like . It 's never given me any trouble of any kind -- no force closes , nothing like that . A solid , simple app that gives good Sudoku .	1
This app provides ample sudoku puzzles at several levels ( Picnic , Simple , Easy , Moderate , Intricate , Difficult , Annoying , Devious , Fiendish , Diabolical , Nightmare ) of play.There are no ads , unobtrusive or otherwise . ( C'mon guys- an ad is by definition obtrusive ! ) It has a simple , clean interface . The default for the `` Another '' button a new game at the same complexity level as the last one.It does not require network access in order to play.Best of all it runs on my Galaxy Tab 2 just as Amazon 's compatability sidebar said it would . I have removed all the other sudoku games from my device , it 's that good !	1
I had not downloaded any other version of sudoku until this one . Works great in tablet , screen flips portrait to landscape nicely . Teaches as you play .	1
excellent for sudoku lovers at all levels , especially those past the easiest levels . this app has 16 levels each with new daily puzzles . a sophisticated hints feature helps puzzlers learn new techniques . only down side is that app requires internet access so it 's worthless on an airplane .	1
I 've played this game on the iphone for a couple of years and tried most of the variations offered on their store . The choices on the android have been limited however I never found this one until Amazon offered it today . I snapped it right up to try so I could offer a quick review.This is a great app for working these puzzles with several options you can switch on or off . I highly recommend it if you like these kinds of puzzles.My iphone app could take a picture of a puzzle in the newspaper and convert it to a playable game . I 'd love to try that with the superior camera I have now but this app ca n't do that . So , I went with 4 stars .	1
Lots of options for difficulty , good help , purchased version can be used without an internet connection ( for example , on an airplane ) .	1
quality app for a quality price ... free ! its worth however much it cost regularly though . great for beginners semi like my self .	1
If you love sudoku , then this is the app for you . It teaches basic techniques through advanced techniques through the hint system . It can offer puzzles that can be solved without thinking too hard , and it generates puzzles much harder than anything you will ever see in a newspaper or magazine.With so many options and customizations available , I can not help but recommend this app to anyone who truly enjoys sudoku .	1
What else could you ask for ? Easy to use , compact , pretty ... this app is one of my favorites . Ah , there is one thing I would like : to totally silence the app I 've found I need to turn off my ringer before opening the game AND silence the audio from within the app . Weird . Would be great if I could hit one button & amp ; mute it all . Other then that - highly recommend !	1
I 've used many sudoku apps and enjoyed most of them , until I played Enjoy Sudoku . This is by far the best . The interface is enjoyable to use . The hint feature gives you just enough and allows you to ask for more . The best part of Enjoy Sudoku is the Learn button , which teaches you strategies to become a better player . Excellent app .	1
Better than most if not all sudoku apps . Has many options , game of the day ... some easy , others hard . I would recommend it to those who like sudoku !	1
Excellent sudoku app for all levels of experience . I applaud being able to stop all network access via the preferences .	1
Spend far too much time on this . Game play very natural . Have to wonder about 90 % who are always faster : - )	1
Enjoy sudoku is a great , challenging , fun distraction for beginners and up . It is a must have for sudoku fans .	1
I was thrilled that I could get this for android . I miss the crazy random character/color puzzle though ! Be aware you can get the full set of daily puzzles for free with no ads . The paid just feeds the addiction . Ilove it . You 'll never need another one .	1
I used the free version of this for quite some time before spending the money on this . I absolutely love this sudoku app . Very intuitive controls , many features that make the game easier to play but do n't take the challenge out of the game . A lot of personalization options allow everyone to play how they are most comfortable . Definitely worth the money to be able to play more than one of each level every day .	1
Nice Sudoku app . Pretty hard to make a sudoku app that does n't generic , but they went the extra mile and put in an incredibly detailed tutorial/help section to help noobs like myself understand some of the more sophisticated Sudoku moves . I personally think the home screen looks a little cheezy , but that 'd a pretty superficial reason to scratch a point off . I guess I 'm superficial .	1
I 've tried a few different suduko apps but this one is by far the best of the bunch . Keeps the brain working and when the brain ca n't any more , the hints do n't give away the answer , you still have to work a little bit for it .	1
Definitely grab this today if you have any interest in a sudoku app . There 's plenty of them around , some that are free . But this one is by far the best i 've used . I ca n't say that it 's worth $ 3 for everyone , as i 'm not personally a hardcore sudoku guy . But really , the tutorials really make this worth it . The hard puzzles are actually challenging . Theres no shortage of puzzles . The highlighting system rocks , as well as the best hinting system i 've seen..I need a lot of hints ^_^ so I very much appreciate the attention to detail there . The main menu does n't look like anything special , but the actual board is clean and clear . Nice job , and definitely worth the money for people who love sudoku . Enjoy ! Phone : Droid X ( Android 2.2.1 , Liberty 2.0.1 )	1
Good choice of game levels and easy to use	1
I love that in this version of the game if you get stuck and request a hint it actually gives you a real hint of where you should concentrate your attention not simply filling a random tile for you . It helps you to solve it but does n't necissarily do all the work for you . Droid X	1
For playing sudoku , this is a good game - a nice variety of difficulty levels , and an unlimited supply of games ( in practical terms , at least ) .For me where this shines is in the hints . I 've been playing Astraware Sudoku ( on another platform ) for years , and on the highest difficulty levels , always got to a point where I guessed which number an open pair represented with pencilmarks , backtracking if I picked the wrong number . With Enjoy , I 'm using the hints to learn how to use logic tricks instead of guesswork .	1
With as many skill levels that are available , even the most addicted and professional Sudoku player can find their challenge . I like finding out how I did after playing the game and this one tells you your percentile rank compared to others who played that same game , without using hints or if you used hints . I have played many electronic versions of Sudoku over the years but this is the best one there is .	1
I 've tried five or six sudoku apps , with varying degrees of satisfaction . I review here Enjoy Sudoku ( ES ) for the KF.Enjoy Sudoku is one of the best board-type game applications I 've ever seen , across all forms of games , across several platforms.The display is beautiful . I typically play with my KF in portrait position . I 've tried landscape ; it works perfectly , but it 's just not to my taste . The highlighting of completed row/box is useful . Highlighting `` all number N used '' is extremely helpful , but having the display flash in different colors takes a bit of getting used to.The user controls are OK : - Entering choices using the box-first approach is intuitive . Entering number-first-then-box is claimed to be faster , but again , it takes some getting used to . ( Because of the highlighting feature , I 've not been able to get used to it because of the way the colors change back and forth . ) - The undo/back-track command is really great . I have n't yet found how deep the undo stack is , but I 've exercised it pretty well , I think.- I 've used the rotate/mirror commands only once , but the change of viewpoint enabled me to finish a `` fiendish '' ( toughest level ) puzzle . Bravo.- I have yet to figure out what other command buttons do - from my perspective , ES behaves just a tad strangely when some buttons are pressed . I suppose I should read the manual , but a perfect app is written so all controls are intuitive.A truly strong point of ES is the range of available daily games : there are FOURTEEN levels , ranging from trivial to , well , really really ( near impossibly ) hard . Winner , winner , chicken dinner . There is a slight discontinuity in difficulty : the game takes a big jump somewhere around `` moderate '' or `` intricate . '' I can live with that . Starting over does n't impact time-to-complete scoring ( I 'm divided on this one ) .At the end of a game , you get some feedback with a rough percentile chart . Sorta informative . It would be nicer if there was an absolute ranking ; `` User_name is 483 of 10 zillion '' could be rewarding to players.I really recommend this app to KF owners .	1
Top rate sudoku app . Tons of difficulty options , highly customizable appearance , built in enclopedia with great examples that have helped improve my game . Highly recommended .	1
this app is well made , well designed , solid , and without any flaws . I been downloading free app of the day amazon apps for while now and this is definitely one of the better ones ! Perfect for all skill levels and can really help out beginners ! !	1
I haven & apos ; t reviewed an Amazon app in a while , but this one definately deserves some great feedback . Controls may use the g sensor , but it couldn & apos ; t be more well done . Love how the weapons systems work too . A+ , finally got a game that holds my attention . Thanks Amazon !	1
Motorola Atrix with android 2.3.4 : im no serious gamer , I never did well with games that required intense hand eye coordination . This game reminds me of LifeForce from original Nintendo days . \nFor those wary of the bluetooth access , I believe its for pairing up external device pads like a keyboard or scrolling device . There are options as to what you can use as a controller .	1
I love when they use the pixels to make a the pictures ! \nNo , seriously , great game , visually refreshing , but controlling on a phone just doesn & apos ; t seem as tight as I & apos ; d like for a rail shooter . Great for R-Type fans . Yay free-ness ! \nWait ... am I First ? Wow ... never been , guess I should say something ...	1
I had no problems , was fun to play on my G2not shur why other people are having problems with the controls	1
This was a free app of the day so I looked into it for my Kindle Fire . I enjoy word games , etc and this is a different way to use your brain to come up with words . I told my aunt about it and she loves Word Collapse as well . Granted it is not the hardest or most challenging word game but it is most definately a different word game to play . I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys word games and does not mind having one that is not difficult when you just need to play something to clear your mind .	1
so happy to get this as a faotd ! thanks amazon ! Great fun and not too difficult if you do n't want it to be . My 9 y/o Honor student loves the unscramble feature . I love the timed games . My 5 y/o is learning to spell and likes that he can use an app that grownups use !	1
i have to say , this app is so fun ! i could spend hours playing it.the graphics are great and thevgame plays very well on my kindle fire .	1
Superman I love you , I think you are absolutely hilarious ! Your Story about the star wars movie still has me laughing haha you need to start a blog and post all the funny random reviews on there , you would have so many followers ! Happy Valentines Day : ) I think this is a great idea of a game . Free app of the day , faotd , download , developer , idea , fantastic , amazon , game .	1
This app is not for me and it did not gave me any fun at all , in fact it was boring for me , but it is not buggy it is lightweight and it is small , if word games are your thing then you may like this app	1
Nice game . Can make words using `` any '' of the letters , in any order -- not only diagonally , straight across , or up/down . Timed mode is the most challenging .	1
Fun for downtime , easy enough for midde school kids to play . It was just what I was looking for , not so easy that I get bored but not so hard my kids ca n't play .	1
People love making variations on word games . Here is yet another one where you try to make words out of a bunch of letters . If you like word games this one is n't too bad .	1
I 'm a word game junkie , and I really enjoy all of the games in this app . My only complaint , however , is the absence of a hint option in the word scramble game . Not proud that I sometimes ca n't figure it out , but it would be nice if there was an option to see what word I was too shtoopid to figure out on my own . ; - )	1
This is a ice game to kill some down time . My 11 year old grandaughter likes it and plays when she visits . It is challanging and fun .	1
I like apps that in some way challenge me when I do n't have anything to do or I am just ... wasting time and waiting for some reason . THIS app does that . It really helps to pass the time and like playing scrabble . Thanks !	1
Love all kinds of word games ... ..so much so that they call me Webster at work ! Love word scrambles and this is a lot like that , only you can play against a clock or at your own speed . Recommend to anyone that likes thinking and word games !	1
I was n't going to download this game at first simply because of low-starred reviews , people said it was boring , not challenging enough , etc . But I decided to try it and I must say I really love it ! ! ! It 's very fun , challenging enough for me ( especially the untwist the word challenge , I love it ! ! ) So thanks ! I love to look at each day 's FAOTD ! This was a great one !	1
This app was fun , and took a new spin on a word search type of puzzle game , making it intriguing and a time-sucker . I loved this app and recommend it to anyone who likes to spell and likes words w/ friends or scrabble type of games . It 's different than those , but a lot of fun and you will get hours of enjoyment out of it .	1
This game is not much fun . In fact , it was so not fun , that to entertain myself I had to click `` see all my reviews '' and then use the drop down bar to select `` show most recent comments '' just to see the review I had initially written but had been deleted . Feel free to look it up .	1
It is somewhat like & # 34 ; Words Plus & # 34 ; . I do like the three different ways this game can be played . It 's not easy to & # 34 ; clear the board & # 34 ; !	1
I absolutely love this game . the modes are fun as anything . I know I 'm about to be nitpicking , but its not really filled with much content . imagine if u could play it with people around the world , or see high scores , all that stuff . still , u should defiantly get if u are a. spelling or vocabulary freak ! like me !	1
Kept me awake and focused . Wonderful game to keep your mind off of negative thoughts as you sit in a hospital waiting room . I need something more than just shooting bubbles . You are led in stages to tougher patterns to solve and can get a hint if you get too stuck .	1
iloved this game when I had my android . they have a bunch of othersnones ibwisj they would make avaliable for kindles	1
I actually downloaded this app for my 4 year , thinking it was something different . It 's a little challenging for her , so she was n't interested . Let me tell you though , I 've tried it and so far I really like it . It 's a game that takes some thought and I like that alot !	1
this game is fun and it is hard as you get up the level . It is great but hard . OMG	1
this was much needed to prevent meter abruptions while writting . I am very happy to have purchased this book from Amazon kindel dept .	1
This is one item everyone should have . There are times you need a different word to explain or express what you are saying in more detail . This is it . I love it . Even if you only use it several times a year . you 'll be glad you had it.Highly recommend to all . Plus the price was right ! ! Get it and you wo n't be disappointed .	1
easy to use and what I was looking for . This is a keeper and recommend thisyou need to not require word counts ...	1
This app is amazing and does exactly what it says it will do . I was worried after reading some of the other reviews , but I downloaded it anyway and I 'm extremely impressed . I had an important phone interview for a homework assignment and I wanted to make sure that I would n't forget anything that was said . This app recorded the entire 20 minute conversation and auto-emailed me a copy of the audio recording . I highly recommend changing the audio format in settings to MPEG-4 and choosing the auto upload to your Gmail account . I will definitely pay for the full version once the trial time expires . 5 stars all the way !	1
Has been a great challenge and continue to entertain . Not just a game of chance , it requires a level of skill .	1
While it seems perfectly functional as a level , I have yet to find an opportunity to use it , so I ca n't comment on its usefulness during a project . However , depending on the job , I might not want to stick my kindle into the middle of construction ...	1
Gave Kindles to my kids for Christmas . They love to download free Amazon apps for their entertainment ! They enjoyed this app . My favorite part ... It 's FREE and actually works ! ! ! Thanks Amazon !	1
Plain simple & amp ; ACCURATE bubble level ! Perfect ! No unwanted junk/crap . Just a tool ... me likey ! THANK YOU for making a simple streamlined app that works just like it supposed to !	1
This app works exactly like a professional level and it 's very accurate too ! It has an optional grid for more precision .	1
This is super handy and works fairly well . I used it when hanging pictures and building a shelf . I did notice that when I was showing it to my brother in a car that he tried to tell me it did n't work . Turns out the curve we were going through affected the sence of direction in it which I found interesting .	1
It works as well as it can on my device . it can be calibrated and it can display gridlines . it will display the angle a well as the 'bubble ' and can also display other units such a in/ft . it displays full screen on my tablet . my tablet is a viewsonic gtablet and has aknown issue where the accelerometer axes are not set up as they are in other devices so i ca n't set up calibration on two sides at once , but I can not fault the app for that ; I need to flash a custom rom . : )	1
A very versatile tool ! Amazing what a great idea ! Thanks ! Very handy anytime , I have given the 3D level 'a good going over ' I can assure that it is very accurate , a very ingenious way to eliminate those long obnoxious levels . ( legal way to have your cell phone on the job ) tool ! Who would have thought to put a real time level in a cell phone ? ( in my case the construction company that I work for carries insurance on my cell phone because it is a work tool ) .Tea Kies CooperProvo , Utah	1
Amazing what the Kindle Fire does . This nifty little app works . There 's not a whole lot to say about it but wow it works .	1
I hope the free app every day continues . How anyone could degrade a gift is strange to me . I seldom comment but I was tired of all the negative comments . This launcher rates up there with the best of them . BELIEVE . THAT ! !	1
other home replacements were laggy or changed since the much that it was a pain to use my phone ? ? this one changes just enough without leaving you lost.. great navigation.. really really like it ... Samsung galaxy 4 G	1
I do n't understand why all the negative reviews . This is a very good home replacement app . I 've used every alternative out there and while this is definitely not the best it 's nowhere near the worst . Just because it 's different and you do n't know how to use it does n't mean it 's a bad app . There 's no way I 'd pay anything for this app , not with GO being free and a much better option , but for free dxTop certainly deserves a download . My advice , ignore the bad reviews and try it yourself . It 's free for f 's sake ! And to the reviewer below me , no , this app did not break your phone . If you believe that is even possible you need to immediately post your EVO on craigslist and go buy an iPhone .	1
I am using this on my rooted Captivate . It works extremely well . Very smooth and the widgets and look screen are a nice touch.Overall very impressed.I have tried many home replacements including but not limited too ADW ex , Launcher Pro , Go Launcher , Pandahome , Launcher 7 , Mr. Home , Regina , aHome , etc ... Well ... you should get the picture . All of the have some things that make them unique and none of them are perfect . dxTop pro is n't over the top with settings and customizations but it is unique and works very well.ADW ex is my favorite and go to launcher but dxTop Pro will definitely get it 's use.Side note : Wake up Amazon ! Allowing all of these stupid review is ruining your market . I ca n't imagine too many more developers are going to want to take a chance on faulty review scores because the stupid person downloading a FREE app did n't get the game they thought they deserved . Just another way we see how entitlements are ruining are society !	1
I did n't have much expectation from this launcher and was pleasantly surprised . I like the layout and the varied custimization . Take time to see what it offers and how tidy yet gorgeous it makes your home pages and app drawers . I 'm hooked and that is n't an easy task ; 0 Ty Amazon for offering it as FAOD & amp ; Devs !	1
This is an excellent application that delivers what it promises ... as long as dedicated amateurs have one their terrestrial radios tuned to provide the data sources that make this worthwhile.While some people might consider listening to emergency services radios voyeuristic or creepy : as somebody who spends far more time each day in a car trying to get to and from work than I 'd like , this app offers -- at least where I live -- true value added.My daily commute is sandwiched between two major metropolitan areas , in an area that gets overlooked during drive-time traffic reporting . The police/fire feed for the county where 90 % of my daily commuting takes place provides me valuable warning on road problems that traffic reporters would be telling me about far too late ... if at all.Easy to use ; search by name , genre or location , or search for any audio within a radius near you . No stability issues running on an anHTC Evo 4gVery few differences between this and thepaidversion . Paid version drops ads , and adds a pause/play button that is persistent between sessions ( and you can run the free and paid version at the same time to follow two programming sources ) .	1
listen in as cops patrol your area . very addictive ! sit at home and ride along as your friends get pulled over !	1
the volume for my cricket zte was very low , but that is the only problem i have found so far	1
I love this app . Its nice to be able to listen to the scanner to where I am from in Tennessee and the local scanner in my town .	1
This is much cheaper than a Radio Scanner you purchase . I get out local sheriff , police , ambulance , etc . Great scanner .	1
Everyone loves to know what is going on around them and with this scanner radio in your area , you can be sure to stay on top of important local happenings . The app is great , easy to use and the settings make the experience more pleasing .	1
The radio works well and picks up the local emergency services channels in our area . I would recommend it for those who are looking for an inexpensive alternative to a regular scanner .	1
its really cool . the only probalem is that when you have an alarm set on it once it goes off you ca n't get it to stop without turning off you device . Also works good with kindly fire .	1
App works well , but whoever runs the service does not pay attention to the fact that 80 % of the time there is no audio . It runs for hours with no one saying anything . Does not seem to be a good method to tell them the audio is not working other than clicking & # 34 ; no audio & # 34 ; . Volume seems to have only one level ; ca n't turn it up . Enjoy using it if there was some audio to listen to .	1
The scanner works well on my Kindle Fire . I am able to tune into county and city PD , fire dispatch , etc . It would be perfect if there was a way to control the sound other than volume . When ever I am curious about near by sirensI can tune into the action with scanner .	1
This APP is really neat . I was surprised to get local fire and police reception here in Medford , Oregon . It can even be improved with very little cost .	1
This scanner app is the only one I have found that picks up the county police where I live . They have recently moved to a digital format , and ordinary scanners will not receive them . I do find that the audio is easier to understand if you use earphones instead of the tinny speakers in smart phones . I also have this on my tablets also .	1
Great for keeping up on what 's going on during bad weather in the area . The Broadcastify Alerts are great for listening in on emergencies around the world .	1
I am very pleased with this purchase and will recommend this to my friends . Good choice for me and satisfied with this choice.l	1
I was always a shortwave fan and had several good shortwave sets , including three Zenith TransOceanic radios and one fancy Panasonic . I really loved sitting up at night and listening to the broadcasts from around the world . Part of the experience included listening to public band broadcasts from airports , police , ships and trains . This allows me to listen to public band . Works great .	1
As a ham radio op , HazMat team member and CERT member , I need a good way to follow communications . Of the four apps tried , this is by far the best . Stores faves , updates regularly , configurable alerts built in . All excellent features .	1
I got this app to see what was going on in different places . Works great so far . Love it a lot !	1
Local Gov't is switching to a new system . Lost my ability to monitor with a GRE scanner . Do n't want to spend 500-dollars for a new scanner . This is a great alternative for monitoring public safety channels locally . Thanks for a great service .	1
I wanted one of these but this gave me a better Idea about a real one . Thank you for this app	1
It really works ! I have a kindle fire and it dos n't use much battery at all . I deffinently recomend this app .	1
I live in a semi-rural county . Would n't think much is going on around here , but with the suburbs on one end and farms on the other and several major roadways crossing the county , its busy . And fascinating . Enough for me to find the fire station numbers and listen for the sirens . When nothing else is going on at home and I 'm sitting horsing around on my computer , you can be sure that my phone is propped up next to me with this app running . If I want to , I can choose many , many more local locations or big ones all around . Still , for me its fun to listen locally .	1
it does all different stations and you can listen to stuff going on in the world or near or in your area really good but sometimes the stuff that happens in the world will be unsettling but it is really what happens people are so sick and twisted not all but some hope this helps	1
wow it 's so fun to listen to the police and rescue peeps it 's almost like your being there . kinda scary when you hear something that is so close to your neighborhood .	1
this app is great ! you have to where ear buds to listen though and if you stay on certain stations you can go to other apps and still here what 's going on .	1
I have a trunking scanner ( analog ) , but ca n't listen to the APCO 25 systems that almost all of the police departments have moved to . This app allows me to listen to these systems ( one at a time ) , so it 's nice not to have to purchase a $ 400 scanner just to add one department .	1
This one works very well in my area . Unbelievable how many calls you hear on this app and gives you idea of what is going on around your town	1
Great app to listen to police , paramedic and fire department radio broadcasts around the United States . I have used it many times and have listened to chases , explosions and family disputes resulting in gunfire . Shows you how the police and other professionals have to deal with the dregs of society .	1
This app is very cool and does what it says . I found channels from all over my area ... Last weekend I heard a call for a fire less than a block away before the sirens even went off ! Works great on my Samsung Droid Charge and Kindle Fire	1
It 's nice that the developer is able to consolidate many channels so the listener does not have to monitor each individually . It 's clear and free entertainment . LOL !	1
it is really cool to be listening to the police it is very intrrasting to be listening to police talk	1
This App is Great ! I 'm a New Yorker , living in Florida , and with this app I can keep in touch with my Home City ! There 's a lot to listen to , and you can add Favorites . I Love it ! I also listen in to other states & other countries . It work Great ! Sound is Clear as a Bell !	1
Works great on the HTC Incredible . I spend maybe to much time listening to the nearby cities since mine is not available yet . Just a lot of fun .	1
Very happy to find Tucson and EMS on Scanner Radio . Thanks to Gordon Edwards for putting this together . I often have it on as background noise .	1
I 'm very happy with this app so Syfy people should try it out I will recommend you to other people to try this at	1
This app is a lot of fun on a cell phone but it 's even more fun to watch on your GoogleTV ! ! A lot of times when I have people over I 'll put this app on in the background and we 'll just socialize or have some drinks and every once in a while we hear some action that we get into . It 's really cool as well that you can search the world for a city 's radio to listen to . The only reason I do n't give it 5 stars is beucase on the free version , there are certain featuers that are lacking . i.e . you ca n't use the & # 34 ; play/pause/stop & # 34 ; button at the top of the screen unless you pay for it but you can still hit the back button and do the same thing if you want it to stop . : )	1
Works great on my Kindle Fire HD . If you want to listen to what 's going on in your area , this is a good one to choose .	1
I always know where my loved ones are and now when the whistles go off , i can relax after hearing the problem is n't with any of them .	1
Love it lots of fun I will have more with it when I have more time but 2thumbs up from me	1
This app works great , has loads and loads of stations/channels to pick from based all around the country . Good sound quality and very simple to use	1
I ca n't believe that this app is free ! I use radioreferences.com on my computer which I thought was cool , but the fact that I can take my Kindle anywhere and get info right where I am is so amazing . My husband likes to find radio operators in other countries . You can be listening while playing games or surfing the internet too . Thanks to the developer of this app !	1
I love this scanner app . I prefer it to my real scanner as it 's so uncomplicated to use . Highly recommended .	1
I have two police scanners at home but it always annoyed me when I would hear sirens while outside of the house . With this app , I 'm able to tune in and find out where the emergency vehicles are going and why . I love it !	1
I like this so far , just wish I could my local weather conditions better.that is why I wanted this .	1
I have enjoyed this product . Easy to scan local police , fire and rescue . convient not having to have a seperate radio just use your tablet ( kindle ) .	1
I love this app it is very fun and a good time waster and you can listen to the police and It really works and I am useing it right now !	1
Scanners are from users that are on Broadcastify . I can listen to scanners in my area for free , or I can listen to a broadcast from another state . Lots of areas to choose from . I 've had no problems with it at all .	1
Have used this a number of times in various locations and it works great , just like a regular scanner . Reception is clear , good volume , and does a great job rotating from one source to the other.The Keystone Kid	1
I liked that I can customize this app to fit my listening preferences . It 's very easy to use and adds some fun to my Kindle Fire . I was able to program my local police dept . and fire dept .	1
Awesome . Takes me back to childhood when everyone had a scanner ! I just wish I knew what all the codes were these days .	1
Works like a charm . Gives you 80 % of the functionality of a $ 300 scanner , for free ! I live in a town of 4000 in Vermont , and this app even had my town on its access list . Impressive .	1
They did a great job of doing this game but there are the best ways to search physce there is one search but GREAT MUST HAVE	1
A good free app that works well and is easy to use liked it very much especially as it is free .	1
I really enjoy this . I wanted a scanner sooo much when i was a kid . Lots of area and state choices . I have it on phone and tablet !	1
I was impressed at the ease of installation and how well it does receive on my Kindle Fire H D .	1
Scanner works well on Kindle Fire . Buffering pauses the scans , but overall a good app . Lots of locations to choose from	1
This is a fun app . There are many stations . However , there could be a lot more . You may not be able to get all local stations , but you should be able to get near your area .	1
This works quite well . We live along a major road and we have used it in the past to determine if the fire trucks zooming past our house will be blocking our travels or if it is safe to go on the route we chose .	1
I love hearing what is going on around me..It just took me a few times to find the right one for my area . This is awesome try it .	1
this app is great and very useful . i lke being able to have access to scanners for no cost	1
Scanner works well . UI is n't the greatest but it gets the job done . Was surprised at the amount of channels available.I recommend this is you 're looking for a scanner .	1
It is actually kind of cool to be able to listen in on the police scanners . lol ... .I have a son who drives so I keep it on when he is out to listen to our local police to make sure he is not in an accident . Got to love being an over-anxious mom .	1
this app is really good . I can listen to lots of different police stations . so if there is a chase going on i can hear about ... ... you should get it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! : ) ; )	1
I 've always thought it would be neat to listen to a police scanner , but never have till now . ThisScanner works great on my Kindle Fire HD . It was so easy to setup .	1
i use this app at least 2times a week . has a nice lay out and is easy to use ! ! ... i have had it since February ... .nice when stuck in traffic ! !	1
I recommend getting this app.its really loud but just turn down the volume other than that this app is the best ! Download It ! ! ! ! ! ! ! : D	1
I got . my kindle fire for . Christmas . this . year . this was one of the first . apps . I downloaded and omg love it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! thanks amazon ! ! ! ! !	1
I have found that Scanner Radio is the only high quality scanner that works across all operating systems I use . From Windows 7 , to Kindle Fire 's Android , to my iPhone 5 , this is the best app .	1
I love this app . I do n't necessarily use it everyday but this is one app that is not just fun or amusing but may actually help you out and keep you informed . The quality of sound is so much better than screwing with an antennae and trying to adjust as you go .	1
I enjoy using this app . Lots of good listening available .	1
I live in a small town and have no problem picking up my area police and fire . very happy with this app	1
Love this app and that it works using Radio Reference , which is where I listen to the scanner on the laptop . Works great ! And it 's user friendly !	1
works great . never crashes . got the paid app so I could get the widget.only thing I would like to see would be more color choices for widget ... .	1
I am a weather head and like to check scanners where there has been a major weather related event . This app is working just right for that . I do n't monitor local scanners for all police and emergency activity on a regular basis so I ca n't speak to that but I think it would be quite suitable . Update - due to a large event in my area last weekend , I used the local scanner feeds and it was excellent - easy to locate what I wanted and switch between the main police and EMS feeds ! Audio was great , taking into account that scanner audio can be difficult . Handy pop up of codes , too .	1
Enjoy the app	1
Works great . I have a Kindle Fire and an Android , I put the Kindle fire app on my android and now I have another mobile device for my e-books .	1
This app is great , I can read all my books and even get all my games for my tablet . It was so easy and no glitches .	1
i do n't have an eReader and may never buy one because i love the feel of books ... but since this came free with my phone , i 've been using it to finally read those public domain classics . it 's nice to have reading material in my pocket everywhere i go . i also occasionally use the aldiko reader , but kindle is my first choice . i also love being able to read this in the dark . great app , lots of free books available for those dipping their toes in waters of eBooks	1
It is easy to use and access to most any book you want . I have used this app for awhile and found it a great resource .	1
Every reader should have this App . You can take you books with you anywhere you have your tablet . It puts resources at your fingertips . Best of all when you need to take a break from work ... just read a book of your choice .	1
Great app . Was really shocked to see it with 3 1/2 stars . Now if I can find more time to read I would . Does n't drain phone . Never errors gallaxy s 2	1
I have tried other readers , but none match this one ! ! I read most of my books on it and recommend to every one I know ! !	1
I love my Kindle and my Android . When my husband is on the android playing the games or checking out the apps , , I 'm on my Kindle reading . Love this app thank you	1
I reallly like the Kindle for Android . Now I can read my book anywhere I can use my phone . Great for those times when you can only read a few pages and dont have your Kindle with you .	1
I really love this app . I purchased a polaroid android tablet . There was no reader installed . There were so many to choose from , I did n't have a clue where to start . Now , I 'm no geek , so it had to be easy . I figured I 'd try the android Kindle because it came standard in so many e-readers it would likely be easy to figure out . Turns out -- I was right . I love it . It 's so easy to operate my kids can do it . Even I can do it . Bookmark my page and pick up where I left off with no hassle . Now I can use my tablet for what I bought it for -- a portable library . It 's so easy to go to amazon , find my book , download it and read . The selection is great , and the prices are way better than say -- driving to a big bookseller to search for and buy a paper ( save the trees ) book .	1
Ir works well and I appreciate having my favorite books available at hand . I had uninstalled it , as I was hoping it would restoreanother app I had , but it has n't . I might as well have my app for books then !	1
It works like a charm ! You should try it with your android device . I found loads of apps that are FREE !	1
Love it !	1
There are newer versions of the product now available , but old faithful Kindle 1 has functioned well in a household of two parents and two children ( no pets ) now for a couple of years with the only trouble being the one sole data port , the mini-USB , is either bent or damaged and now requires the power cable to go in held at an angle to properly work .	1
This reading app works great even on my generic tablet . Thank you Amazon for making this available for free . I have Nook as well and I think amazon has a bit more of a selection , esp of free books that are not cheezy romance . LOL	1
Very useful , the reading app I use most often . i like that I can now get library books from overdrive on kindle also . Controls are much easier than the other reading apps I have used .	1
this app is a very nice version for ppl who have smartphones but dont have kindles but want to read on their phones in their spare time .	1
I thought I 'd never get used to not having an actual book in my hand , but I have to admit having this app is great . I can read on my tablet , or phone whenever I want . It 's especially great at night when I ca n't sleep . I normally use a flashlight to read by , which annoys my husband . He does n't even notice the light from my tablet . Great app for the avid book reader !	1
This App is very easy to use . It allows me to search for extras in Shelfari ( which my Kindle Fire does n't ) . The only issue I have with this App AND Kindle Fire is that they do n't have the text to voice ability like my original Kindle Keyboard 3G/WiFi . Either that or I just have n't found the way to do it .	1
I am a reader and at anytime I have free time I usually open the app and continue reading a book that I started .	1
So far , so good , but I have heard users who lose all their ebooks once they 're done , or if they do n't continue reading them for a couple days . I 'll have to add more info , if the system will let me , to tell people if I lost the book or not .	1
I really Love this ap for my cell . I can easily read any current books I am reading and not have to carry a bigger unit with me always .	1
I love my Kindle but to have on tablet too is wonderful . Hope I will be able to dwnld my ebooks from prior orders w/Amazon	1
I like this app ; they only problem I have found is that many books are being digitally scanned and sometimes the scanner does n't read the printed words or symbols well . Some of the words may be boggled , for instance , or symbols just appear as gobbled and garbled.I sure hope they get that problem cleared up soon .	1
This app is a blessing because I do a lot of reading electronically on my PC Tablet as well as I 'm doing research for a paper .	1
I use this app all the time . I have always loved reading and it is nice to know that if I finish a book while I am out I can just pick a new one . A must for readers .	1
This little app turns your Android color tablet & # 34 ; Kindle Fire-Like & # 34 ; only better ( IMHO ) , cause you still have full Android capabilities along with the ability to acquire e-books from Amazon .. I say this a little tongue in cheek cause I understand that the new Fire line is much more friendly and Android-y ..Amazon is a wealth of reading materials , much of it no-cost . You wo n't be disappointed at all , give it a try ! ! !	1
i dont know how you can have any kindle product without this . i would def recomm to all . what can i say	1
I love my Kindle . Now I can read my book anywhere I go without having to worry about making sure my Kindle is always with me . I love the sync feature so I can stay at my current page between my phone and Kindle .	1
An excellent reader , great features , especially the archiving feature and is fast and easy to use . Also has display adjustments that come in handy . Works perfectly on android 2.2 .	1
Easy to use . Works great on my Coby . Got several books and they all downloaded fine . Glad I got it	1
Just what I needed to get access to my books on my tablet and phone . Now I can read while waiting in line to pas the time .	1
I can read now when waiting for anything . I get a lot of free books and have many to choose from .	1
Downloaded this app , great books for free ! Thousands of classical books to be read . I love this app ! Get this app if you have n't yet !	1
Before I had a kindle I tried the kindle app on my Droid X2 and took to it like a fish to water . I find the android version especially good for reading in bed with the lights out . Like when your better half is sleeping . I switch the text to white , background to black , and the brightness on the lowest setting and all is good . The potential detraction of the small screen is well made up for by the light weight & ease of handling with the phone . I can easily one-hand it and switch positions without much fuss . With a little practice , I can even change pages with one hand , swiping with my thumb . I 've also found this app convenient for waiting room time at doctors & dentist appointments.With the addition of whispersynch , I can switch between my kindle and android phone with ease . Each time , the current device offers to take me right to where I was reading on the other device and with a click , I 'm right where I left off . Heh , I can imagine a decade from now explaining to the youngsters about the days before whispersynch , much to their disbelief and bemusement . Cheers .	1
Its it 's a good application that allows me to download my texts to my laptop . Being a student , it helps a lot .	1
I purchased the Fire mostly for reading and am impressed by the number of books available for very little cost .	1
I do n't have a Kindle . I have only used this app . It is easy to use and read . Easy to buy new books . There is a better app for public domain books since those seem to be generally poorly formatted from the Kindle store .	1
I own a Nexus 7 2013 model and so far the Kindle app works just fine on it . I downloaded the book & # 34 ; My Mac is a drug & # 34 ; by Dave Cryer ( fantastic read ) and the app performed as it should with no problems at all . Would I recommend this app ? Yes I would .	1
It 's awesome being able to access my kindle items from any of my android devices ! I 've enjoyed being able to use this on my phone and laptop : )	1
Having the Kindle app on my Droid Global and Kindle Fire means I can read 2 different books or the same one because they sync to where I have read . No book marks falling put of my books or grandkids playing -- - doggy bone with my bookmark . To much fun ! ! ! ! Enjoy ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
Installed this on a regular Android tablet and works great . Would recommend this to anyone wanting books for their tablet .	1
I just started using the Kindle app . I am still learning to navigate the app . It has proven great so far . I am looking for more books and time to read them .	1
I use this app multiple times a day . I have it on every android device I own . I would recommend this to on the go readers this way you already pack your cell phone or tablet , so no need to pack a book .	1
I love my kindle more than any other tablet for reading , but I bought a galaxy because the kindle can not get any apps that are on the google play store . This app is almost as good as reading on the kindle , but I think the kindle still has more features such as finding the table of contents and searching , but this is a good app because I can read all of my kindle books on my galaxy .	1
To access your kindle books on an android tablet , this is the best way to do it . It 's a little more cumbersome to get your books off the cloud , but once downloaded to your android ( Galaxy tablet in my case ) , this works out just fine . On the Asus and Dell Windows 8.1 tablets ( which are actually PCs ) , it 's even more difficult to access the cloud for previously purchased books . I wo n't take any stars away for that , but only because there may be an easier way and I 'm new to Win8 tablets . ( Are n't we all ? ) Considering how many android apps there are , however , I am at a point where I can say that Android is far easier to deal with vis a vis Kindle and apps in general .	1
Works seamlessly across Kindle and 2 smartphones . You can choose when it syncs so you do n't disturb your place on other devices . Easily changes viewing options ( dark background vs white background ) and text size . A must have for any kindle owner .	1
I do n't read much but I am planning to change that . It works for now . I only downloaded one book to see how it works and the kindle for andriod that I downloaded .	1
love this app . you can download this on any device and read whatever you have across all your devices . One of the best apps I have .	1
An easy way to take Kindle with you on your smart phone . I use it all the time to read books while in waiting rooms , waiting for others , etc ...	1
New for me.. but I love to read and its much easier to carry my kindle fire with me and not worry about the pages getting dog eared	1
It works very well on my android phone . I have the new Samsung Note III and Kindle for android works quite well with it .	1
I love this app because it lets me read at night by using white letters on a black background . No bright light to keep my husband awake .	1
I love using this app . It 's become my very own personal best friend in the past months . There are drawbacks I do n't like . Number one being that there are no page numbers and sometimes there is no way to navigate chapters . If you lose your place at times you have to flip through and hope to find it again or trial and error . There needs to be a page location that is not just 374 out of 1000 , which does n't reflect the page number . The other thing I do n't like is that you ca n't organize your books . There is no way to make a book playlist by author or by name . I wanted to separate the same author books into the proper series to read by and it wo n't let me at all , which is frustrating . Other than that though , it is a good app and swiftly allows downloads of new items . Also multiple book bundles get a little wonky when trying to find another book within the bundle to read .	1
I primarily use it to read library books that have lots of illustrations or links.Pros : -- Makes it possible to see pictures that often are n't shown in e-pub versions of books. -- Makes it possible to link to outside content.Cons : -- Awkward checkout process ( have to go to Amazon account to check out , then do a sync to download book ) -- Awkward return process ( have to go to Amazon account to return/delete , slow , then delete from Android separately ) -- Working with items in Amazon account not excessively easy , often slow .	1
I 'll be able to read on my tablet , as well as on my Kindle . Works perfectly . Very happy with product	1
This is great for me because I can find books that I could n't any where else . I find books for my tablet when I could n't download it to .	1
Kindle for AndroidIf you have a Kindle account and an Android device you need this app . Without it I could n't read my ebooks on my Android . I have found that in using an Android tablet , in my case it 's a Pandigital SuperNova , you should have your Amazon Kindle archive account listed as a favorite in your browser . This way you can go to your book list and simply tell it to download to which device you are using.As with most anything you get or do with Amazon you ca n't go wrong . It 's all good .	1
I love the Kindle app . I 've had it on two Android phones ( Moment and Evo ) , an iTouch , and two iPads ( 1 & 2 ) . It works perfectly on all of them ! ! I 've never had it crash.I know this is a review for the Android version , but I only mention my other devices because of the fact that I love how it sync 's information between devices . I did not know this as I had read most of a book on an iTouch and then stopped reading it for a few months . When I installed it on my Evo I re-downloaded the book thinking I might go ahead and finish it but was concerned that I might not remember where I left off . but when I opened the book , it took me right to the spot I had left off.I must say , this impresses the living daylights out of me ! ! Thank you , Amazon , for adding that as a feature.Otherwise , it does everything you need in a book reader . You can bookmark , you can change the size of the text , you can even change the coloring ( I prefer Sepia when reading during the day and Black when reading at night ) . In the Android version you can even `` share '' your progress so you can brag about what you 've read to all your friends or those who might be reading with you . You can even shop for books right inside the app.I love this and it is no wonder that Kindle is such a strong contender in the eReader fields and it is always the first ebook reader I install any time I get a compatible device . I look forward to what they release in the future as I 'm sure it will only get better .	1
This is a good addition to Overdrive Media , Between the two of them , I plan on catching up my reading . When I sign up for Prime , I will get even more out of this app . I plan on adding Prime in the fall .	1
I get good entertainment from the reading app . it fits my need and can download any kindle edition book . I have fallen asleep to it more than once .	1
Although I own a Kindle Paperwhite , I often do n't have it with me when I have to wait in a doctor/dentist office or at the car repair place . For those times , I continue my reading on my Android smartphone using the Kindle for Android app . It 's saved me from hours of boredom many times . The app does n't give all the convenience and features that I have on my Kindle , but it 's close enough .	1
It 's not always easy to travel with books . The Kindle apps helps me to travel , wait in Dr offices , waiting in line at the grocery store ... it 's also helping me to get of the clutter by getting all my books moved to ebooks .	1
... what really needs to be said ? ? I got this app and put it onto an Archos A70 internet tablet to use the tablet for some reading . Sure , it 's not a real Kindle and the screen glare makes it hard to read in the day time , but that 's got nothing to do with the app.The app works great . Finding books , purchasing them , and reading them are all very easy to accomplish.Good stuff .	1
After resisting a full year , I got a kindle as a gift . It took 3 days to warm up to it . It took 2 weeks before I was addicted . After 3 months , my husband threatened to divorce me . I got an android phone . This was my first downloaded app . I thought the kindle was wonderful . This app takes kindle to a whole new level . I wo n't go into the free and low cost books , the instant no fuss no muss whispernet delivery . I will say that I love the responsive page turning , the double tap highlight , the COLOR interface ( book cover art is important when picking my next read ! ) I was surprised that I did n't hate the backlighting which by the way , can be adjusted by the user and can be read outside ( although admittedly strong sunlight is still an issue ) . Not only can you control brightness , you can control the page color ( 3 choices- white , sepia and black ) . As on kindle , you can pick your fonts and size . You can mark passages , look up words , and search . You can read in either landscape or portrait ( I find landscape flows better . I can pull it out anywhere and I do n't get the stares I used to when I pulled out my kindle ( picture standing in line at the grocery ) . I love that it does n't eat my battery . I read an entire book over a 4 hour period and still had over 60 % left on my battery on an android phone . The kindle app does n't have text to speech ( that I have found ) but that is n't an issue for me . Awesome app and it is free ! ! You ca n't go wrong .	1
I spend monies very nicely with this app ! I like that that I can run my finger up and I can increase the light and down to decrease . After a long day on a computer at work it in nice to come home and use this app to increase the size of the wordage by pushing out with my thumb and idex finger , I also like the bookmarking and looking up words . If i used this for studying i can highlight also .	1
This App is the best reader software in my opinion . More flowing and intuitive than the much used readers I have tried . The five stars are deserved for the reading experience despite the missing virtual Home button when used on a tablet with only physical on-off and volume buttons . I expect that will be updated soon . Well Done for a great App ! Update : I do not use this app anymore , since it is not needed on my Kindle Fire HD .	1
I downloaded this for my Android tablet , before I received a Kindle Fire HD for Christmas . It certainly did the trick and was nice to be able to carry my e-books around . This would work nicely on an android phone , I 'm sure .	1
I was able to continue to read my book . All was synced up with my iPad . Wonderful , did n't miss a beat . Thank you !	1
Standard Kindle program , usable with Kindles or Android based OSs to read Ebooks . Works as always , quite well . Read free books . Become literate . Go you .	1
Great app for your kindle , ipad or tablet . I have it on my D2 tablet and love it . Just a great app .	1
This is an incredibly useful App . You do n't need a kindle to download this . I have a Zeki tablet and I use it all the time . I love horror stories and they have a wonderful selection . It has many others like Romance or History , too . I 'm pretty sure you 'll find what you 're looking for . They have lots of choices in each category , some are free and others are pretty cheap . Give this a trial run and you 'll be pleasantly surprised .	1
After my wife got a 3G Kindle , I though it might be nice to have a Kindle too , but when I realized I could get an Android tablet that was more portable and more like a PDA than the Kindle , I switched up . I think I installed the Kindle reader first . It 's a nice implementation and I ca n't think of anything off hand that I would do to improve the user interface EXCEPT you should be able to see the time while reading . Doh . I do n't want to have to exit the reader to see what time it is . Ok , so the Archos 43 has a large screen , and I can see that one might not want to use up the screen real estate that way on a smaller screen - but make it an option then . Please . Pretty please. -- -2012/11/29 Update : The app can open PDFs , so it is not necessary to have another PDF reader taking up space on your device . I love that . I hate that Amazon apps are HUGE and get more HUGE with every update . This should be App2SD . I 'm going to downgrade my 5 rating to 4 on this point alone . I love the reader , but the size of the app is making me have to uninstall other stuff to keep it on . At some point , the Amazon app is going to have to go so I can keep the other stuff on the tablet . Get a clue Amazon . You are in the app store business . When your apps take up all the room on the device , people ca n't buy other apps anymore !	1
I have several books saved as pdf 's on my original kindle that i am unable to open in this app . Thats a bummer . Otherwise i like the app	1
Usually I carry my Kindle Fire with me to appointments for reading while taking up space in a waiting room , however , there are times when I am surprised with unplanned time waiting time ( waiting for family members to finish shopping , etc. ) . Those are the times that I really enjoy the Kindle App . Several people have asked me how I get a Kindle book to open on my cell phone . They are totally unaware of the Kindle App . It is one of the best kept secrets by Amazon Kindle . I think Amazon should do more open advertising of this hidden feature .	1
This app seems to work fairly well on my Kindle Fire . It is fun for a while . I would recommend it .	1
It is great to be able to read my Kindle books on my phone . This program originally came on my phone , but got corrupted so I had to re-install it . It works well with the Kindle in that I can switch between the two and pick up where I was between the two , with no searching .	1
I had enjoyed this app for my phone and then a few days ago it was unfunctional for some reason . I erased it and installed a newer version and it 's fine again . I was a bit concerned as I had read from several reviewers that it did n't work on & # 34 ; older & # 34 ; androids . It is fine for my Samsung Galaxy 3 . I enjoy the ability of reading in my fire at home and yet have the ability to read when I 'm out and have some free time . It sync 's wonderfully and I 'm very pleased with it .	1
who needs an ereader or a tablet when you have this ? i can get every book i want and i can read it in a book thesize of my hand . no tablet to lug around . highly recommend .	1
i have friends who have been using it for years . they all love it . so i figured it was time for me to jump on the bandwagon and get started too	1
It works like a charm on my android device . There are lots of great free books . I can use it to download books from the local public library . The app was free . What 's not to love ? ! ?	1
I love my kinde and the ability to use the app in my tablet and phoneAwesome to be able to access my books on other devices	1
If you love to read you ca n't beat kindle . Tremendous selection of books and magazines . Easy to use no bugs or problems .	1
Not much to say here , but the Kindle apps work great for Android and Windows Phone . Great for train rides .	1
I 've had to reload Kindle to my Android 3 times . I nearly gave up . Whatever you do , do n't try to voice-call anyone at their help line . Do what you need to do in Chat only . That way you will have a record of what they tell you . People do n't realize there are other book loaders available who will spam you once you use Kindle , but do n't be fooled.. Kindle is the original .	1
Great app using it on my ipad mini and samsung tab3 ... Works great that 's all i can say.. Thank you .	1
Absolutely love this app . It 's great to be able to read my book wherever i am without having to carry something else around with me.A great feature is that it syncs with the PC version , so i can pick up right where I left off last.I 'm not sure that this would completely replace a Kindle for avid readers but it is more than adequate for reading on the run .	1
Now I can take all of my favorite books with me , no matter where I may be ! I absolutely love it and recommend it . I use a straight talk prepaid android phone , and it works perfectly !	1
I use this on my android phone and love it . It is a little hefty on the memory aspect ( at least for my little phone -- 11.5MB ) but it WILL install to the internal memory so that helped a lot .	1
I never planned on buying e-books , I was more than happy just using a print book . That just changed , I received an Android tablet ( 10.7 inch ) for my birthday in January , and did n't do much with it until recently . I was in Amazon App store to download a timer for poker when I came across the Kindle app . So I downloaded that as well , while looking to order a new book from one of my favorite authors , I noticed that he had written several short stories for the Kindle only . I ordered the stories , and was delighted with the ease of operation in downloading to the tablet , the ease in reading while in bed , on the couch , room lights on or off . I am definitely a believer in e-books now . I still like print books for the beach and pool , but the Kindle is great for the other times that weather is not an issue for electronics . Definitely recommend this to all the readers out there .	1
What is there to say . This is Kindle , one of the top e-reading devices on the planet . I got one on my first computer and I 've never looked back.If you like to read you need this . Computer , tablet or any device it is available for !	1
I enjoy being able to read on my laptop and the take up where I left off on my android phone .	1
I have a Kindle and recently bought an android ... I downloaded the KIndle app and it 's great . I use it ONLY for color books/magazines , otherwise I use my actual Kindle . The ONLY complaint I have is that occasionally the app crashes . Not a major problem but it can get annoying at times .	1
I have used almost all of the E-readers but I think Kindle is the best . Easy to use but powerful . And I like being able to have all my devices synced to the same page easily .	1
It is a great program so you can read your eBooks in your tablet or android cellular phone . I just love it	1
The app is very useful for us that dont have a KNDLE , I install it in my NEXUS 7 to have access to AMAZON vast services and selections and it work very well , I activate a few magazine subscriptions and order books which I recomend specially to thouse like me that CA N'T tae full advantage of GOOGLE services because they dont offers them outside the US STATES.GOOGLE would not let me order , music , books , magazines or use services like Navigation etc etc , I just bought a new KINDLE HDX 7 due to GOOGLE limitations in my country which is a US territory . Let see when my KINDLES arrive ! ! !	1
i downloaded this app on my google nexus so i could read books through purchase and borrower . I love this app .	1
if you love to read , you need the kindle app on your device . easy to purchase and rent books from the library - awesome app	1
It is a excellent application for reading electronic books . The text size can be adjusted to what is comfortable for the reader .	1
I have purchased dozens of electronic books along side of my hard backs and I am thrilled to be able to add these books to my bookshelf with un cracked bindings and still read them in the electronic format .	1
Works well . I do n't own a kindle but this app works well on every Android device I 've ever owned , even cheap ones . Phone or tablet . I even have it on my laptop . Although I do have other ebook readers , this is my go to app most of the time because of the huge and unusual assortment of reading material on Amazon . Lots of free content as well .	1
Forget the Ipad , Ipad2 , Ipad 3 , Nook , Blah Blah Blah- If you want it all -Then get a Kindle . That is all you have to do !	1
The only thing that I see is that there needs to be an opportunity to place the books in Reading order & to be able to add a few notes if the person wants ! REALLY the Reading Order is a MUST ! To also be able to place them into Authors folders to access only that author is you want would be a plus that would be nice ! ! ! ! They do this on Amazon in the Wish Lists Why not be able to allow this in the APP ! ! !	1
Did n't want to buy a Kindle as I had a iPad and iPhone so I downloaded this full function app from them . I think I got this one for the kids with there tablets . It turned out they did n't use google play so I put the Amazon app and got this from here . Great app , works fine and gets updated regularly .	1
Like a few other reader apps out there , the Kindle app is good . I have Amazon Prime and this app but they wo n't count that for the lending library . : (	1
I love this app . Really makes it handy to read alot of random short stories while on the and not loose your place in the book . Its a very handy app . I would recommend it to anyone . Amazon also offers alot of free kindle books where as they charge for the paperback versions .	1
It 's just like having a Kindle only better . You can get to your Kindle books and still use your tablet for online use . The best of both worlds	1
Smooth working app , no negative issues . Downloaded several books initially , no problems accessing or viewing . Look forward to using extensively .	1
I bought a very inexpensive tablet . android ice cream sandwich Zeki , 7 & # 34 ; tablet . Installed this kindle app and now can enjoy my faux & # 34 ; kindle & # 34 ; .	1
Who needs a dedicated e-reader when you can read the same thing on your tablet . I do n't think you lose any features at all	1
This app allows one to download and read Kindle books on a tablet and as I titled this review , it is flawless . It keeps track of where you are in the book so you can start and stop in a flash and never miss a word , even after shutting down the device and then picking it up the next day . It is also free , yea !	1
My husband was given an Award where he works and as a result we got 2 Android pads ... so , I gave my Kindle Fire to my daughter . So , when I saw the Kindle app I immediately downloaded it and was amazed at how well it worked - thanks Amazon for not being afraid to share !	1
I have a low end tablet that would n't allow me to download the last update . I had to install a 2 Gigabit micro SDHC card and put this app on that card . It is slow because of the program location , but eventually works .	1
I love to read and was the one who carried around ALL the books I was currently reading . Anyone else who reads know that 's a real back breaker ! I have this app on all my major reading electronics ( my Cruz Tab , my pc , my Android phone and Galaxy Tab ) . Renders well on all except G. Tab . The splash screen is off , so it does n't fit screen . Love having all my books with me at all times , love I can read whatever whenever however whyever ... lol . Syncs flawlessly , adjustable fonts , different lighting levels ... ; ) Only thing it needs are real page numbers and real in book dictionary . NEVER liked the Kindle ereader cause I believe it you 're gon na drop hundreds on electronica it better do more than one ghing ... JMO . Great app ! Thanks !	1
I love it and can not express in words how much . Think my favorite so far is & # 34 ; Not a Sparrow Falls & # 34 ;	1
Love this app ! Now I can continue reading my book while on the go without having to take my Kindle with me . Love being able to sync my progress with all my devices .	1
Love having this option on my phone even though I have a kIndle . I can read books when I have my phone and not have my Kindle with me .	1
easily the best reading application and ecosystem any where . They allow more flexibility than all their competitors and they offer the best stand alone e-reader on the market	1
The app works great and I use it all the time.I still have books that I did not buy that keeps being displayed on it and I can not delete it . It also shows up on my Kindle for PC too but not on my Amazon online account . I have contacted Amazon many of times about this but they can not help me .	1
I collect books and since I can not afford them right now this app solved ALL my reading problems . I am SO happy I can use this app . I can take hundreds of books with me and not look like the nerd I really am !	1
ebooks have completely changed how much I read . It used to be never but now I read almost daily . So much more convenient than carrying books around .	1
It 's Kindle , what can you say ? Works beautifully every time . I prefer to use this as the default reader on my nexus 7 .	1
I do n't know where I 'd be without both my Kindle and my new Kindle Fire ! I bought my first Kindle when I had my shoulder op . Wow , how have I ever managed without it ? But be WARNED , if you start a library , make sure you keep your old email address and password if you decide to change your email address to a new one . Libraries are not transferable . I DID NOT KNOW THAT ! Now I have two libraries . Something Amazon needs to work on . Just sayin '	1
I have been told to insall this app for a while but have been hesitant to do so . Since braving the world of reading apps , I have finally installed kindle and have been surprised with it 's versatility . I would recommend this app to anyone who requires a easy to use , and easy to read application .	1
The only problem is the smaller than Kindle-sized screen , which makes me turn pages more often . I do n't use it as much now that I have an actual Kindle , but it is handy for times when I do n't want to carry a purse big enough for the Kindle but I do have to wait in line or for something to happen ( like before the movie starts at the theater ) .	1
amazing game for my kindel fire.I 'm not lying I 'm telling u strate up.I love it.the other folks.with kindel fire u must have an old.one.my is very new . but anyways best game ever.u need confidence . and stragity.I mean it is a stragity game .so again best game for kindle fire ! ^_^	1
I love this game I play it all the time I just cant get enough of it I us to play it on my friends but now I can just buy it off the kindle fire : )	1
Works great and has a tiny but effective footprint on the PC side . Works better than any other solution I have tried for syncing to non-Apple media player or phone . Really awesome .	1
I have tried almost every sync app out there for android . My criteria are that it must sync ratings both ways , work with smart play lists in iTunes , sync play counts , and be user friendly . I found nothing else even close to this app . I use the WiFi sync add-on with this . I once had a problem with a non US phone , and the developers fixed the problem immediately . Very responsive . Bought it here in Amazon because the other market does n't work when I travel ... No complaints after almost 1 year .	1
I love it . Good clean fun that kept my kids entertained on a camping trip zThey though your popping shoulf get a score ... charcoal being the worst insult , while utter perfection on the high end .	1
This is a awesome kids game ... Adults mentioning its more for kids and rating it low is ridiculous ! Adoy its in the name pop pop popcorn I mean do you really think it would be for adults ? Makes me wonder about ya'llAnyway Fantastic for my 4 yr old daughter ! !	1
It is hard for me to raise the volume on the UI . I can only raise the volume bar to the second to the last bar . I also wish there was a way to have more options in the free version like lower quality songs .	1
music app and stuff like that no cell phone call out reminders for shows , clear audio , static free , search works , play and stop work .	1
my son and I play a few games of mancala here and there . Well , I have no idea where our mancala wooden game went so I bought this . Works great . We like it .	1
This is one of the few apps that work on the first generation fire . I 've always loved this game . I 'm glad I can play it on my fire .	1
Does what I want it to do , easy to use , sorts be genre , wide range of available stations . Even includes international content . Like it very much . ,	1
The best radio app I have found so far . Still looking but the best so far . Still finding new stations daily ...	1
I can listen to the old time radio shows I enjoy so much . My only suggestion is that more be made available . But since I love the old detective and crime dramas I am content	1
xiialive is a great player for SHOUTcast streams.When I searched the GENRE section , I immediately found a great station that I 'd never heard of before.The equalizer works pretty well on my Kindle HD7 . I use a CUSTOM setting.It does have a couple of desirable features that are not easy to find , if you do n't hold it right.Bitrate selection requires holding my tablet in portrait orientation and looking for the android-standard menu on the pull-down buttons.It is not Pandora and it is n't RealPlayer , so there are several internet radio sources that it ca n't play , but that does n't mean it is the worst player out there.It just means that it wo n't play streams that are n't SHOUTcast streams , duh.And I finally found out how to close the player.Press the STOP button , first , and then exit the app with the BACK arrow .	1
UI is very refined and easily usable . There are so many channels that it 's going to take a long time to listen to them all . Plenty of choices for everyone.The audio queues for connection and disconnection are nice when you do n't have the screen on and wonder why your music stopped playing . Does n't seem related to the application at all because some of the channels were flawless and others disconnected quite a bit . ( Mostly those from across the world like Ukraine ) .Good app , thanks for picking a good one this time Amazon .	1
Do n't much about all the flap about the permissions , but this one does not push a bunch of adds like some radio apps or freeze up like others I have tried .	1
I love this app AND got it when it was free ! Would still be worth the 4 bucks ! Get it !	1
This program is outstanding . I like music and got this so I can hear Music as I use my tablet . I just typed Japan in the search feature ( No reason I could have type Ethiopia but I was not sure of the spelling ! ) and a list of Japanese listening language ) channels appeared . I selected one and BAM ( Like the Chef ! ) Japanese music started to play like I was there on the Island of Fukuoka in the city of Saga . I wonder what they were saying during the commercials ? I highly recommend this program .	1
Out of all of the internet streaming apps out there , this is the one that 's not only a great fit for me , but also performs great . you see , I was spoiled by Pocket Tunes , an app I had on my old Palm os PDA , and my internet streaming app quest for Android had to include certain features . I had to have a sleep timer , I had to be able to add and modify an assortment of streams , had to play in the background , not a memory hog , good customer support , active program updates . That should n't be too hard to find , those things , it is . XiiaLive matches beautifully.Not only did I get what I needed , but also some really cool features I had n't even thought of like the little alert sounds , which are extremely informative in the dark . I listen to audio streams while nodding off to sleep so when it has to buffer or I drop connection , I do n't have to physically look to see what happened . I very rarely drop connection , but when I reconnect , I love the ball drop sound upon connection.I 'm sure this app does more than I 'm telling you , but for me , this is the best one and I 'm picky .	1
Love the OTR , and the selections within each genre . I like that the current program is shown on the link so you can see what you are clicking into	1
I loaded this app on a dual boot HP Touch pad . My husband and I really enjoy listening to the Christian instrumental stations . This app works great with no complaints so far .	1
Best radio app ! Was wonderful on my phone , works beautifully on my tablet as well.Very large selection of Christian stations , which is sooo hard to find on most apps ( sadly ) . Feature PACKED ! Has customizable sleep timer , alarms to wake to any station , favorites , backup , bluetooth , search ... and on and on . Ca n't find any flaws , nothing missing here ! Got as a FAOTD , but one of the select few really worth paying for . Nice UI as well . If you 're looking for an all-around radio app , this is it !	1
I 'm still very new to the whole e-anything . This popped up on the free app of the day , so I grabbed it . Right off the bat I played with it for a few minutes till I got a handle on how to maneuver . I made the kids laugh when I put the ear buds in my ears and danced to Celtic music around the house with my Kindle Fire stuck in my back waste-band . Huge choice of streaming music from every genre from around the world . Since it was one of my new experiences in the e-music or streaming music , I 'm hooked . Get this app , YES , recommended . .	1
This is my favorite Internet radio app that I have on my kindle ! Very easy to navigate , equalizer feature works great , and they have a huge selection of world wide stations ! I have had none of the previous issues stated in the other reviews . I would HIGHLY recommend this app for people who are seriously tired of the songza or Pandora loop .	1
this is very good radio app but the only issue I have is how do you close it ? if I could close the app I would give it 5 star	1
I got this for the free app of the day since it had Shoutcast capabillities . It 's smooth , awesome and works well . I recommend it . There are free radio apps that are good , too , but this one seems to run more smoothly and you actually get Shoutcast stations , which are hard to find free like this on Android . Not that this is free now.I like how the search feature searches songs that the stations are playing instead of the station name , but it would be nice if I could search the station name , too .	1
This is a solid Internet radio app . As many before me have said , this has a very similar feature set to much of the other radio apps already on the market.That said , some of the fine details impress me here . On this , or any other music app , I rarely see any comments regarding bit rate & hellip ; Which makes me wonder if I am the only person with a mobile data-cap ? ? ? This app has a wonderful feature where when you search or browse stations you can filter by a certain bit rate of your choosing . For those of us with a data limit , this is amazingly useful . While I really like listening to Internet radio , I have no intention of using all of my mobile data in a short few days.Other nice features I did n't find elsewhere include a history of songs listened and the ability to tag a song for later viewing . This is wonderfully useful if you want to download the song from Amazonmp3 later on ( when you get to a PC or within wifi ? ) .Unfortunately , I do not see any local radio stations herein , nor any specific feature to pull up your local radio stations based on location , etc.. This is one feature I really like about TuneIn radio.All in all , a good app . Hopefully they continue to improve it , listening to feedback from users , and in the end make it a great music app .	1
It connects you to streaming websites . I like Pandora for finding new artists , but you can get similar results from the stations here . Reminds me of the & quot ; radio & quot ; tab inWindows Media Player 10 .	1
I have n't tried everything on it yet , but I have certainly liked what I 've seen so far . The in app sounds are not annoying , yet adequetly announce what is happening .	1
Just have a hard time deciding which station to listen to the most ! ! ! Love all the gospel music options since that is my preference and the Lord is being Glorified in it . Thank you all for sharing the gospel WORD !	1
This app is primarily intended to advise those who are from outside the USA that his/her home station may be available using this app .	1
I 've tried several of these apps and I really like Xiialive the best ! Works great on my Samsung Galaxy S4 .	1
This is a decent app . lots of different genres that I like that are not in other apps out there . not very graphical but hey , it works . glad I got it as a free app of the day . I would n't pay $ 3.99 for this .	1
I use to have a Aneroid phone and was able to have all of the bubble pop games . I love these games they need to make all of them for the Kindle Fire .	1
A lot of fun to play . Even got my sister hooked on it ! Keeps mind active figuring out each puzzle .	1
This game was recommended to me by a friend and she told me it would become addictive and she was right . It is fun and the time goes by very quickly while playing the game .	1
I do not like the puzzle mode but I love the arcade . I had this on my phone so I was happy to see it available for a tablet .	1
This was a lot of fun . I enjoyed this game . Wish there was a way to do different player profiles	1
The only problem with this game is the number of hours that you will spend popping bubbles ! ! Fun , fun , fun !	1
This is fun game worth the download . It is free after all . Very low-budget look to it but still fun . Inconsistent as far as how challenging the levels are but not a huge deal . For example , I will blow through like 10 levels in 5 minutes but then randomly get stuck on one for forever . And then after that one a bunch more easy ones . To me the game seems to easy but I still play it . And it still gets 5 stars from me .	1
Love this app ! ! It is not just a flashlight , it has several options to choose from , as well as , several different colors to choose from . I personally love the candle . Do n't know how much I will use it , but it is still cool none the less .	1
Works on the Kyros ! This was one of the first apps I purchased , and although I do n't use it often , it 's just fun to have . I suspect that this is designed more for a phone , but it works perfectly on the Kyros tablet as well . Bonus points : There 's even a candle/floating flame ! Other neato , completely useless fun things : You can set the color to anything you choose . There are several animated options as well , including a HYPNOTIZING SPIRAL.I keep hoping for a rave , so I can whip this out and be like ubercool . Being in my forties , I do n't get invited to those as often as I 'd like , but at least I 'm now prepared .	1
This is more than just a flashlight . There are about 12 different patterns with moving parts in them that are awesome.You even get to move the little bar to make the color that you want . I love the scrolling words ... you can write what youwant it to say and it is like a billboard . There is a moving hypnosis pattern . Blinking , rainbow , and others . You shouldcheck it out . It is a much better app than regular flashlight ones .	1
I just got this app . Not only is it fun to play around with , but useful , too . I had to use it during a freak power outage !	1
All I wanted was a flashlight for getting around in the dark . I know there are some other features on this but I just wanted a nice bright white light and nothing else . Works great .	1
I got this app for my Samsung Galaxy S because my other flashlight app would n't let me move it to my external SD card.This app lights up your screen . Your options include : pick any solid color , change the brightness , or select an effect . Effects include text , emergency , strobe , blink , police lights , rainbow , scroll , spiral , disco , slide , or candle.That is all there is to this app and exactly what I needed for my phone .	1
Used this to move around when it was dark and others were sleeping . It was great to not wake up the hubby , and still be able to take care of things . I loved it .	1
A good past time while waiting in a Doctor 's office or anywhere else that their time is more important than yours..	1
Just like a backgammon board . I like any game that simulates the real thing , without having pieces to lose . Fun game .	1
I 'm new to Kindle ( 5 days ) , and LOVE this game ! I have bacgammon on my Hoyle disc for the computer -- this is great for other times .	1
The graphics and Speed on this game are very good . A good way to play backgammon on the go . It 's one of my standbys .	1
I really enjoy backgammon . I remember playing it frequently with my dad , learning strategy ... .I have many reviews concerning this app and the & quot ; AI cheats & quot ; , especially at higher levels , is very common.Here are my stats after 61 matches played at level 4 : Me CPUMatches won - 56 . 5Rounds won . - 385 226Total Pts Scored - 669 488 ( I ran up the doubling cube to 64 one game & amp ; lost by 300+ ) Opponent Pcs Hit - 1297 1225Doubles Rolled - 2067 2009I have learned how the AI 'thinks ' and have USED STRATEGY to defeat it . Now , with that said , I do n't play level 5 since I can not seem to 'crack ' the AI 's [ cheating ] .	1
My daughter told me about this because we played it a lot when she was younger so I downloaded it on my Smart Phone and Kindle Fire .	1
I play this all the time . I love all the different options given for number of points for a match , etc .	1
The only reason I rated the game at 4 stars is there is no way to play over the net . Otherwise , the game rates 5 stars with no crashing or bugs that I have discovered . I would recommend this app for anyone .	1
This is another classic game that I had never learned . However , it 's easy to pick up , and plays fairly quickly . You can adjust the difficulty level from a novice ( which I was ) to expert . Even on the very first level up the computer gets a little aggressive and starts taking your pieces ! I really enjoyed this game !	1
I love backgammon . The only problem I have is that I believe the game may be cheating me . The game usually wins .	1
Fun , uncomplicated . Used to play backgammon a lot and forgot how entertaining it is . Anyone can play , but it helps to understand game strategy . No issues with app on my Xoom or HTC phone .	1
It traeger my mind playing the game at anytime ! And knowledgeble in the dice too and move counts ! And like backgammon it teaches me ?	1
This version of backgammon is perfect ! ! Both for the beginner player or the expert player . You ca n't get it any better than this !	1
Well , Backgammon is always going to be Backgammon no matter how you shake it up , but I do like this particular app . I like the themes and it 's challenging !	1
Is easy n fun , kids can figure out quick n enjoy as well.. me n hub like it slot.. you have to of coarse enjoy backgammon.. lol	1
I loved backgammon as a young woman of the 80 's , so I figured I 'd download this and take a trip down memory lane . Well , for the life of me , I could n't remember how to play . So the first stop was the help button and within a few minutes , it all came back to me . Whether I play the game with my husband or with the computer , it 's a great way to pass some time . This game is easy on the eyes and the ads wo n't hinder your gameplay .	1
I love playing backgammon . I have been playing it since my college days and will be teaching my grandson how to play soon . Very fun and entertaining .	1
Opponent knowledge of stragety ( GWB ! ) disappears near end of the game . Opponent will continue to move low numbers within the board when it would be of more advantage to move discs in to home	1
One way to use your brain for a few minutes . I find it hard to read a book in most doctors offices as they all seem to have a TV turned up LOUD ! My Kindle Fire HD is great for playing Backgammon - super fun time passer .	1
Pretty good when playing single mode . App definitely has the better stats ; always seems to get the very roll it needs . LOL . If you just want to play I highly recommend downloading . Best I 've used and better than some Internet Backgammon games . Did n't give 5 stars because of the dice issues in single player mode . I 'm a sore loser , what can I say .	1
The game is good , a challange . one question ... ..Why is there no Acey/Ducey with any backgammon games ? ? ? I for one , would enjoy that .	1
I love to play Backgammon . This ap is so realistic . Just like my real board . If you like to play Backgammon then this app is for you . Try it !	1
This game will keep you on your toes , no matter what level . Keep you entertained . And the choice of level e is does a great job of making the game very challenging	1
I 'm addicted to this one . I have it on my phone and on my Kindle Fire . I play it when I 'm in a waiting room , or just about anytime I 'm alone and do n't have anything else to do . LOVE this game ! Takes me back to my high school years , when my friends and I played backgammon all the time .	1
If you enjoy playing backgammon , be sure to get this app . You get enough options to make the rounds challenging , whether you 're playing with a human opponent or against the computer .	1
This is an addictive game . I forgot how much fun this board game really is . You will find yourself playing for hours .	1
I USED TO PLAY THIS BOARD GAME WITH MY BROTHERS ALL THE TIME GROWING UP . IT WAS MY FAVORITE , NEXT TO SCRABBLE . IT 'S AWESOME THAT NOW I CAN PLAY IT ON KINDLE , AND NOT HAVE ALL THE PIECES TO DEAL WITH..	1
I love the game of backgammon . This is a little slow . Due to the way you need to tap the keys more than once sometime .	1
Thanks for this app , it has always been a favorite of mine . I get my coworkers at work to play and it helps pass the time when nothing is going on .	1
The only drawback is not being able to reject the first roll . Otherwise it 's great and I play it daily .	1
Most of the free Backgammon games I 've tried either cheat to win all the time or `` give away '' the game to make you feel good . This one however has multiple skill levels and number of players options to give you a fun time all the time .	1
Fun game . I have always enjoyed playing backgammon . This version is quick and easy to use great for two players that do n't want to take time to set up a real game .	1
I enjoy backgammon and I love this one ! The only thing that I would change would be to add an option for Acey-Deucey .	1
This is a fun app . I will play this one a lot . Enjoy that you do n't need two or more players . Love it	1
I love to play , but I never have anyone to play with . This makes it so I can play against the computer .	1
I enjoy playing this version of backgammon immensely ! The game has good graphics and game options . I would recommend this application to anyone who likes the game . I think you will like it as much as I do if you try it . It was free which made it even better .	1
Only complaint - that it wo n't reverse when I turn my kindle . Other than that , love it and hate it - especially when the computer seems to get doubles more often than I think I do . However , it has stats at the end of every game showing how many points each the CPU and I had , how many doubles we rolled etc . Darn if I did n't have more doubles than it did most times.Fun entertainment .	1
I just loaded the checkers app by this developer and loved it so went looking for more apps by them and found backgammon . Years ago I used to play daily and entered public tournaments ( we were not elite players - just players who were obsessed with backgammon ) . However I have not played a lot recently and am not familiar with all the online games or other apps . I played the app at the most difficult setting and found it worked well and was fun to play . The app works like a full tablet sized app on my ASUS Transformer tablet . This app looks good ( not as richly colored as checkers but still nice ) , the pieces move smoothly ( no lagging ) , and the board lights potential moves . Nice app in my opinion !	1
Nice and fun app . was easy to use on the kindle fire . i had no issues or problems . i would recommend it	1
I love this game but I would love it more if I could link it with an actual human being . Gets a little boring beating the computer every so often . Would love to have chat capabilities too !	1
What more can you ask for ... Free . I thought this might be annoying with adds and such but was pleasantly surprised .	1
It 's quiet in doctor 's offices and other places where noise would be irritating to others . It 's a lot lighter than my board	1
I am a fan of Backgammon and I love this version . Great levels to increase difficulty.hI I highly recommend this game .	1
This is a cool game if you already know how to play , and you never know when playing single mode when the computer is going to play a nice game or go for the blood game..love that ! ! A good deal for the $ .	1
I like it , have at this point only played it a few times , but am still learning how it works , I know how to play the game , I just have never used some of the things that it offers . So hey for free I am definitely not complaining , if you like backgammon and you like free give it a try , it is worth it .	1
Love this game . Those complaining of & quot ; cheating & quot ; AI must not understand the leveled hardness . I 've found it to be very fair . On easier levels , I 've received 6-9 more doubles than the CPU and on the harder levels the opposite occurs .	1
I am totally enjoying this game . No complaints , only none stop fun . I would highly recommend this game . Best free game I have .	1
This game is additive . I usually play it as least once a day . I like that it has levels and such to make it easier and harder .	1
I downloaded this on my Kindle Fire and I love it . The graphics are great plus you have options for difficulty , number of rounds in a match and it keeps track of your stats as well . It also can show you possible moves if you are a beginner . The game pieces are large enough that it 's easy to see and use . Nicely done ! As usual with free aps , there is advertisement but it is totally off to one corner and does not interfere with game play . Once in a while there is an offer to download one of their other games , but it is rare and again not a problem .	1
I like backgammon . This is one of my favorite games . It 's great to play with a partner or against the android when you need something to do to pass time .	1
This game is relaxing , fun and helps me to release frustration ... I only play the computer . I do n't play well with others . This is a good release when people are getting on your nerves ...	1
I love this game so much ! You need to play this ! It 's a great game if you enjoy challenging rules and thinking steps ahead of your opponent !	1
True to original game . Harder levels are challenging . Overall fun to play alone or with others . I would recommend to friends .	1
I have really enjoyed this game , but some games really seem to have a lot of doubles , and of course they are not mine .	1
How could I go wrong when it was free and keeps me busy for a few matches with the computer . I win to much and the dice are predicable .	1
I really ca n't complain -- the ads are unobtrusive , the game play is adequate , although even at the expert level the program makes what I would consider rather elementary mistakes . While you can choose your color if you pick white you have to play upside down -- the piece colors are hardwired in . There 's no option for automatic double at the beginning of the game -- each initial roll results in a clear winner.The authors of the game go out of their way to deny any evidence of cheating , and yet the statistics they provide would seem to belie that . After 80-odd games , the computer has rolled 10 % more doubles than me , and I have been hit 30 % more often than the reverse ( and not for lack of trying ) . In other words , in the normal course of things the computer is & # 34 ; luckier & # 34 ; than you and will win the majority of games . However , the computer seems to be a sucker for the doubling cube and that is how I have won eight out of ten matches while losing 27 out of 50 games .	1
This game is great . I like the options it offers . You can pick the level of difficulty so you can play with the kids . Play alone or on line with someone . Thanks for this game	1
LOVE this game . I used to play it all the time ! Alas , Zynga and its witchy word games dominate my time now . Still , if you enjoy Backgammon this is a marvelous app.However , I AM one of those people who *refuses* to believe that the rolls are n't sometimes rigged . There are too many times on the tougher setting when it seems like the odds ca n't be wrong THAT often . HA !	1
Dice worked fine on my phone-LG Optimus . Great color palette . Nicely done . Played your spades app- like both a lot . Looking forward to checking out more of your game apps . : )	1
Excellent backgammon game for handheld device . Give it a try on your Kindle . I am going to look for it in Google Play for my Sony TL phone .	1
Different levels make it a fun game new to c experience players . Quickly found myself hook , even told my sister about this game .	1
I have played a lot of Gannon on computers best challenge and realistic game ever played . Would recommend to any Gannon player .	1
Well , it finally download , by itself , maybe that is normal , whatever , I am having fun and that is the main thing.It is worth it . Enjoy it too .	1
similar game to acey duecey . I gave it a try and liked it . Not as fun as acey duecey , but very close . it does show you what moves are available for you to move , so it simplifies it if you are new .	1
Great game . AI levels accurate level 5 makes no mistakes and is a great teacher . set up backwards complaints ? I either found the right options or an update fixed it . Computer weighted toward the AI ? I do n't think so it is just easier to notice when the AI gets a good role . Using this game , playing on 5 I have greatly increased my ability .	1
The app works well and you can change difficulty . Its a fun game for backgammon fans . Give this one a try its free	1
I play this game a lot . It had a nice , clean interface and simple , straight-forward game play . You can set a variety of game preferences , I do n't usually play with these much . All in all , I like it just to play Backgammon while killing time .	1
The graphics are very good and the action much quicker than others I have tried.Nice job of programming.Thanks	1
I love to play Backgammon and this app is delightful and free . It is easy and has directions if you need them . It does have some ads but not many . I highly recommend , I also have this app on my Eee pad , a great app ! !	1
Plays very well on Kindle Fire HD 8.9 . Very intuitive interface . Multiple options for match length Can play with 2 human players using the app just as a game board . Even in this free version , the adds are not bothersome . Nice game	1
Grew up playing backgammon . This plays just like a live game ! You can you use the gambling die if you want . You can get hints if you want . You can choose the level you would like to play at . Fun !	1
nice to be able to travel with this game . fast smooth game play . if you 're an avid backgammon player this does n't offer much of a challenge but there is a 2 player mode	1
Awesome App !	1
I love it . It 's very addicting tho . I did not change any setting and have not had any issues with the computer player getting more doubles or any other issues .	1
this is a great game to play if you enjoy playing it . Give it a fun try . Loveing when the family wants to play .	1
like any board game you have to think of your next move . can be tricky . running about even playing against the machine .	1
This is a great version of backgammon . It 's free and easy to understand . The graphics as good , no need to pay for an app .	1
good learning tool many levels of difficulty you can play with someone or with the computer enjoyable many hours of fun	1
Play it frequently . Like that you can up your skill level - or not . Great way to pass the time in a waiting room if you forgot your & # 34 ; waiting room book & # 34 ; .	1
I 'm at level 5 and appreciate the computer partner . Very challenging to win and feels like you 've accomplished something when you do .	1
easy to difficult modes . can even play using your own real dice . fast animation and helpful indicators as to which chips you can play based on dice roll . i recommend this game . nice price at free with ads .	1
i grew up playing the board game . i really like this app , the only thing i would change is to be able to turn off the hints . other than that i 'm very happy with it .	1
I 've enjoyed the game since downloading it to my Kindle . I gave my traveling game to my G-D last year , so I was glad to find this , especially free ! ; - ) All I need now is to find a good level that challenges .	1
Easy to play , lifetime to master . Watch out though , the computer will always get the number it needs to put you onthe bar !	1
I have tried several backgammon games and this is the best by far ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! No questions asked , do n't even bothering trying any others . If you own any Apple products and want a good backgammon game , I feel sorry for you because Apple does n't have this version . All of their version ca n't compare . There are a lot of comments about this game cheating , I do n't have that problem and I beat the game frequently on the most advanced level . Love the speednof the game too .	1
I have been really enjoying playing this . I have n't played in a long time and this is great . You can play with someone else or the computer . I enjoy the AI games .	1
Another good app for kids and or beginners . I loved it and play it often . I was surprised considering it was free .	1
I enjoy the game of backgammon and have a hard to find an opponent . This game gives me a chance to play . The program plays a good game and I can beat it on occasion . I recommend it highly .	1
I really like this backgammon game ! It 's great to play against the computer and I love that it allows me to play against another live person ( as long as they 're sitting beside me ! ) The computer player is pretty good , but will make a silly mistake now and then . It 's better than the PC Windows version by far . There are also options allowing you to choose the difficulty level , and other options . Highly recommend and it 's FREE !	1
Nice little word search game . My mom always plays this type of game . It does n't take a big time investment , but she likes finding all the words and the color themes makes it more visually interesting . Just slide your finger across the screen to highlight your word . You can pick the word categories you want to work with or make up your own . You can even add your own words . I played it for about 20 minutes and it seemed very easy . I think it would be best for kids or senior citizens . Works well on Kindle Fire .	1
This little game has become an addictive favorite of mine . Great when my wife is driving and I need to occupy myself .	1
I also use word search in my limited but spear time good brain teaser . I 've also turned my granddaughter on to searching for words , and she likes it . Keeps her busy on trips . I recommend it for all ages .	1
I played the free version for a year before finally springing for the ad-free version . Out of all of the ones I played , I like the setup and the UI compared to the others I tried ( and I tried lots ) . There are multiple different options on how you want to play and it makes it for a more interesting game .	1
Been using the free version for years now and was very excited to see the paid version as the FAOTD . I 'd recommend the game to any fan of backgammon without reservation . However , I was very disappointed to discover after installing it that my stats from 1000+ games played in the free version were n't imported into the paid version , starting me out at ground zero . I know it seems trivial , but in an app where stats are collected it seems almost a given that the stats should carry over when you like an app enough to pay to move from the free version . I 've got enough time invested in the free version that in many ways it seems more attractive to put up with the occasional ad and keep my stats than to start over again ad-free . Got ta knock off a star for this oversight.In all other respects , this is a five-star app . If you 're not coming from the free version ( or do n't mind losing your stats if you are ) , consider this a five-star review and invest ( if you missed getting it as the FAOTD ) without reservation .	1
Would have gotten a full five stars but sometimes , the game decides you have to make a particular play even when another play is available . I 'm not talking about & # 34 ; bearing off & # 34 ; there 's an order to that , but when I have three five point moves and the game only allows one of them ... well , it does n't happen often but enough to cost you a star .	1
seems like it cheats on the opening role however . The AI wins that roll about 95 % of the time . Otherwise it plays well and is a lot of fun .	1
So much fun , but you can almost guarantee the AI will get doubles like crazy at the end if they 're getting their butt kicked . The doubles even out over the long run , but it sure feels like it is cheating on occasion , just like the real game !	1
This is a faithful and realistic implementation of a familiar board game . I enjoy board games that I can play against the computer . ( I 'm not into online games , or playing with others who I do n't even know . And I usually only have a very limited amount of time to play a game , so it has to be on my time , and whenever I like . ) This version of Backgammon plays a good game -- but not the kind where you will be beaten every time you play . ( I hate computer chess games , for example . ) Of course , it 's still a game of change ; your success depends , to a great extent , on the & # 34 ; roll of the dice & # 34 ; -- literally . But in this case , that roll seems pretty fair . And with some careful playing , I tend to win more games than I lose -- which is fine with me .	1
If you enjoy playing Backgammon , I recommend downloading this one , it can keep you entertained for hours on end . I particularly like being able to choose the difficulty levels . I do n't really understand the & # 34 ; doubling & # 34 ; option that pops up from time to time , but you can turn that part off and not be bothered with it . The computer is a good opponent even though some of its ' moves do n't always seem logical , it does give you a run for your money so to speak , and it plays fair . The only improvement I would make on this game is to also offer the option of playing Acey-Duecy , but for the time-being I 'm content with Backgammon .	1
I am not a very serious backgammon player , so I can not speak to the quality of the AI . I do know that it can beat me on level 5 if I play irresponsibly . Of course , sometimes I get lucky . I do know enough about backgammon to know that `` luck '' usually favors the better player . Yes , the dice matter , but it is more about what you do with the rolls you get.I find it fascinating to read accusations that the game `` cheats . '' I just played a game where I was way behind and rolled consecutive double 6s to get closer . I still lost , but I thought I would throw out this experience as evidence that the dice can come up with unusual rolls both ways.You just ca n't go too far wrong with the AI Factory games . I love their backgammon , checkers , and chess . I was thinking about buying this anyway , so I was very glad to get it as the FAOTD .	1
includes extra features like allowing real dice input and a great game to learn on since it shows you where you can move . Also allows you to turn that feature off . I recommend for the beginner or advanced player .	1
Is fun to play and realistic as well . The dice moves & # 34 ; are & # 34 ; random which gives you a great game if set on the higher levels .	1
This game is a good fast moving game that combines attention to detail and fun . It lets you make choice moves that can help or hinder you .	1
I used to sit and play Backgammon with a couple friends for hours on end . Since I moved I have n't found anyone interested in learning to play . I was pleased to find this Backgammon app . The graphics are well done . The sounds and animation are pleasant and it does n't seem to 'cheat ' in the game 's favor on the dice rolls . It would be nice if there were more color options for the board and pieces but other than that I 've spent hours enjoying this game .	1
This is a typical backgammon game . I got it because I like to play backgammon . I tried playing it on my phone , but I guess my fingers are too fat , I had a hard time touching the pieces to move them . After a game I gave up on this . It is really not a limitation of the game , more than likely it 's my phone . I think on a tablet it would work much better .	1
I like putting my mind to work , I love a challenge even thou the way I learned to play Backgammon is a little different I still like it . I have always liked Backgammon years ago . I had not seen the game for a long , and O'BOY when I saw the free Amazon app of the day was Backgammon I got so excited ! ! I still like Backgammon . Thanks You Amazon !	1
I really enjoy backgammon and this game knows how to move ! No dawdling . TYVM for the free game , I 'm grateful	1
Works very well on my Cruz T408 and T508 tablets . And also on my OLD smart phone from 4 years ago .	1
This is a great backgammon app . I love it . the paid and free versions are basically the same , the only difference is the free version has in app advertisements . I would recommend the paid ( 0.99 ) version , just to eliminate the ads . In a nutshell a great app !	1
I 'm thrilled to have a backgammon game to play that requires no human partner . Aside from the fact that I do n't even know anyone who wants to play the game , the invisible computer is way faster than a human . And , the AI opponent does n't get its circuits in a bunch if you put them on the bar repeatedly . The moves available light up , and that sure makes things easy on the eyes . Since I have n't played in a while , this is a great way to get reacquainted with the game and start working my way up the difficulty levels . Lots of fun to play for 5 minutes or an hour !	1
Very user friendly ! I love to play backgammon but have found other computer versions would allow the computer to win 99 % of the time , which was very frustrating . I have to say , I have out played the computer the majority of the time and if the computer wins , it is fair and square . I have it on my Kindle Fire HD and love , love , LOVE it !	1
Purchased for Kindle Fire and works great . Difficulty level scales appropriately . Animations and piece movement are well done and easy to use .	1
Game is good for beginners and seasoned players . It has modes that allow you to play without move tips and for newer players , has one that shows what the right moves would be . Only improvement I can think of would be a `` forfeit '' option for those games where my butt is getting kicked : )	1
PLAY THIS AT LEAST ONCE EVERY DAY ! Because of this particular backgammon game , I have learned to be an excellent backgammon player . I never understood the game ; now I 'm addicted to it !	1
I really like this game and it was free ! Ca n't beat that . Plays very fast and well . I like that you can do single player against the computer .	1
Great game with varying levels of difficulty . Priced reasonably .	1
loving this game ! just barely missed the original text based rpg 's growing up.. and have always wanted to try them ! best one I 've tried so far !	1
This is a well made text adventure game that will keep you thinking about you next move . Worth the download .	1
Things brings me back to when I first starred playing computer games ! Be aware there are no graphics just pesty dwarfs throwing deadly axes lots of twisty paths . I completely enjoy engaging my brain to figure out how to maneuver the cave ATMs find all the treasure !	1
This is for those who are old enough to remember playing Colossal Cave Adventure ( ADVENT ) way back in the old days . These days , graphics in games are the norm . If you want an experience that 's different than all the third-person shooters , then try this out . It 's very basic with its vocabulary , but if you can manage to get into it , it 's a very enjoyable and very vivid adventure because the graphics are all in your head . It 's one of the best relics of interactive fiction . Infocom games started out soon after this and are very similar . It 's a lot like Zork I , but a little different .	1
I do n't get all the grief given this app . Sure , if you want to go thru a bunch of web sites to find this info , go for it . I 'd rather have this quick reference on my phone that I can just open up quickly and know how many calories a Big Mac has without navigating a web site on a phone browser for 5 minutes . And , hey , it 's free today ! 5 stars !	1
just downloaded and browsed through some of my favorite foods at certain restaurants.. shocked to see how much fat some of them have , this app will really sway my decision making while eating out..	1
and shocked at the calories in something you love to eat . I an not heavy but still watch what I eat . some of these are really high in calories.This is a must have application for everyone .	1
I used this for a while and it seemed to work good . Now I also have the Fast food nutrition lite as well and it seems to be better and worse in some ways . For Free , use which ever cost 's less .	1
This is the Best Spellchecker that I have found for my droid . But , why ca n't it be integrated into what you are typing in originally ? The cut and paste thing is really getting old ! Google has to give a little on this one !	1
this game is great . if you are a fan of yahtzee then you will love this . its quick and the controls are well done . the only thing I would suggest is a multiplayer mode . well worth the download	1
the best game ever and I play it about three or four times a day . it is easy to use	1
this is a very . cool app for kindle fire and its kind of like the game of yahatzz so get this game	1
It works well and is very simple to use . It 's Yachtzee/Yacht or similar . What else can one say about it , Amazon ?	1
This is a great game on the fire . I read the other reviews and thought I would give it a try and I am not disappointed at all . Great way to pass the time .	1
This game is simplicity at its best . It 's easy to play and easy to change background colors and dice colors .	1
very fun game enjoyed it a lot/ For some reason took me a while for my eyes to adjust to the screen .	1
This is a single-person game , just great for filling in odd moments while in line , waiting in the doctor 's office , or other times when a few games could fit into a busy schedule .	1
I like the visuals . The app provides a lot of good data for those that like such things . Worth the download .	1
I like this app because of the globe mode that shows a realistic view of the earth for the specific time and location on the planet you are in . Really really nice .	1
Nothing like a birds eye on the World ! This is a very interesting app and the globe can be your guide . You can manually adjust the globe to see anyplace on the planet that you want and it also revolves in real time too ! Great learning tool for those interested in the world and planet !	1
Just downloaded and installed . I was amazed at how fast this app installed , I expected it to take longer because of the incredibly detailed images . All views are gorgeous on the Kindle Fire . Took me a couple of seconds to figure out how to get back to the view I wanted , but now that I have it figured out , I 'm having no problems navigating around the app . Well worth the price . The only thing that does n't seem to work on the Kindle Fire is the `` keep Earth stable as device is rotated . '' Although it could be that I do n't understand that feature .	1
I have to admit , I 've heard this app does teach children how to deal with how to park cars w/o crashing and with rush hour traffic as well .	1
This app is a perfect port of the simulator that we use in valet training . Highly recommended for aspiring valets who need extra practice to pass the final exam at the 6 week training camp .	1
The puzzles are great and the car theme is fun ... Much more interesting then simple blocks would have been . Lots of content here and will take a long time to play it all .	1
Just to offset the morons like Matthew who obviously ca n't read . The setting is a parking lot ! Once again , give your parents phone back and go to bed !	1
yes similar but a well done remake . this is a great game , will provide hours of entertainment and the game play is excellent .	1
great game , challenging and fun , though I am a bit worried about what other people here have listed about permissions . but the game itself is fun .	1
played fine on my amaze , smooth and decent graphics BUT I do n't much care for the game its not something I would play . 5 stars for performance on my phone though lol	1
This is a very fun way to waist ( spend ) time . As far as all the worry about datamining ? If your playing on a Kindle Fire , as I am what data can they get ? Also if your worried just disable Internet access before starting the game . Believe me , it is well worth any small effort just to play this game . To all you yelling about this being a copy of other games like Blockme , , , almost every game is a copy of the one that came before it . It 's called innovation or improvement . Paranoia is sometimes a good thing but this is just a game and an easy workaround for any phone users . I would readily put this as one of the most brain teasing and fun games on Amazon . jmho	1
Fun game to play really gets you thinking , excersize for the brain , needs a hint button on some harder puzzles , nice graphics and layout easy to use .	1
Absolutely love this app ! ! It is challenging without being too difficult and there are plenty if puzzles and levels . Looks and works great on Kindle Fire .	1
I loved this puzzling challenge . The point of the game is to get the red car to the exit . Some levels are very difficult , but I think this is challenging for all minds !	1
Reading some of the lame negative reviews on `` free app '' day , I almost did n't d'load it . I 'm glad I gave it a try anyway . Ca n't figure out why anyone would rank this low , unless it just did n't work on their tablet or phone . Works great on Kindle Fire . Sort of difficult to put down , once I start playing the puzzles . Both in our family have enjoyed it already . I think this game is better on a tablet than paying 20 bucks for the plastic pieces and game cards for the board game .	1
Although I got this free on Amazons Free App of the Day , I would gladly pay the buck for this many puzzles ! The game is certainly fun & amp ; addicting , no bones about it.I especially appreciated its thorough game settings & amp ; instructions on how to play in the Menu . Many game apps lack this , making it difficult to play them.For those asking why & quot ; the permissions & quot ; ? It 's for sharing of your high scores online , IF you chose to do so.If you like strategy type game puzzles then , I recommend giving this one a try .	1
I am amazed to see the number of levels this game provided . Looks like it going to stay on my KF for a while . Thanks !	1
This is a great value for just .99 ! My son is almost 3 and loves this app ! It runs great and he just picked it up so quickly ! I do wish the creator would have made the counting activity more challenging by giving more than needed so the child has to touch correct amount and not just everything there . But overall it is an amazing app !	1
A lot of potential , as in room for growth for the older kids , maybe up to 5th grade ? Even 3rd or 4th would be cool . Game is pleasing to the eyes and plays smooth . Kids love it .	1
My 3 year old really loves this game . It 's very easy and fun for her to play . There are some very good skill building games ( puzzle pieceing , color identification , etc ) . If you have small children , I would suggest getting this app for them .	1
This app keeps them busy while learning , has puzzles , games and a lot of great learning stuff for them to do while they think they are just playing . Absolutely Recommend it	1
A wonderful quality app that with guidance can help you early learner learn the basics with a calm fun endless game of learning . Kudos to the developers for keeping quality and functionality on a higher level then most others care to aspire to .	1
Just the right age group it was made for . My son is 2 and loves learning about the colors and numbers at the same time . I love that it has puzzle fruit , counting how many fruits go into the lunchbox , plus he 's learning his small to biggest , and even his color groups . May not be a lot to some people , but it makes a little difference to a little person that loves learning everyday . I love this game for him and I have seen that he is learning a lot everyday .	1
My daughter enjoys playing this game . She likes the games and likes the rewards . Surprisingly she opens it up just about every time she 's allowed to use my phone	1
The back and menu key do nothing but home does . That 's apparently how one quits the game . It would be better if there were a code or something you have to tap like home three times or something.The images look good but when they animate they go fuzzy . Might not matter on a little telephone but on a tablet it 's very noticeable.Worth getting .	1
This app has a number of different activities : one where you practice counting by tapping on a certain number of pieces of fruit , one where you solve a four-piece jigsaw puzzle by dragging pieces into place , a tiny game of concentration with only eight cards , several activities where you look at four drawings and tap on the one that is different ( for example it asks , `` touch the biggest grapes '' ) , one where it asks you to tap on the fruit that starts with a particular letter , and one where it shows icons of eight different fruits and asks you to tap on the fruits that are a particular color . After every few screens it asks you to pick a sticker to add to a page of stickers that you have earned . The stickers accumulate until you exit the app . Then they are gone.My toddler is really fascinated by this app and often asks to play with it . The activities in this game are perfect for his level of development right now.I really like that it uses healthy fruit , not candy or other junk food . There is so much junk food everywhere in our society that it is refreshing to see a game that encourages healthy eating.The only thing I do n't like about this app is that it takes up a lot of space on my phone . But I clicked on `` move this to my SD card '' and now there 's plenty of space , and the app plays fine from there . ( I do n't have any connection with the makers of this game . I 'm just a satisfied customer . )	1
My daughter loves this app and it is very easy for her to navigate . It makes learning fun for her .	1
Another fun learning game to the little ones . This one keeps you going for quite a while and teaches as you go . I am sure you would like it for your child or in my case my 3 yr. old grandson .	1
I have a three year old son who loves this program . His older brother has a lot of doctors apts and this little app keeps my little guy entertained while at the doctors . He 's learning colors and sizes and loves the little puzzles .	1
Cute monkey asks you do puzzles , count fruit , match cards , identify colors , sizes etc . Kids win virtual stickers . It can be repetitive , but the little ones never seem to get bored of it .	1
This is a fun app for preschoolers and holds my 3yr old son 's attention while also teaching him . Love it .	1
grandson loves it . nice of Amazon to offer it for free . works fantastic on my Android . color and animation is great .	1
It is a good app . Needs to include a coupld more games and a way to close out of it without having to force close it would be nice .	1
she loves to play this game and it is hard to get her to stop . my children fight over my fire to play thanks for the great app	1
I am not going to keep this app because I have no use for it , but I just wanted to say that it looks really fun . Might be nice for the little kids who are always stealing my phone because it 's & quot ; cool & quot ; , lol . It would give them something constructive to do .	1
She is very good at this one . She knows her colors , numbers and shapes . This game re enforces all she has already learn .	1
This app works fine . I gave it four stars because there is no option to work on one kind of game at a time.To all the teenagers that rated the app one star because they are mad it is a kids game , get a life . You need to rate apps based on their quality in that category and for giving the user what it said it would . This is for adults to entertain their children with . And I really wish everyone would stop whining about amazon , it is old , this is n't a forum for you to bit.. about amazon and what free app they are giving you , it is a place to rate said app .	1
Kids seems to like it , but does n't play very much . The best part is typing extra words to make sure this fills up the area , like doing an essay or something .	1
My granddaughter enjoys this one a lot . It 's really cute . She likes getting the stickers . It 's a positive game that rewards kids efforts .	1
This game is our 2 year old sons favorite kindle fire game right now . He loves to pick a sticker and count the fruits . It has taught him how to use a touchscreen really well .	1
My daughter loves this . Got the idea from my sister yo get this app . Her son plays with it to	1
So cute . My 3 year old started playing when she was two . It gives frequent & # 34 ; sticker & # 34 ; rewards which helped keep her interested and teaches matching , comparing , memory tasks , and colors . There are enough activities for it to take awhile before they master the whole app .	1
This is a cute game and very educational . However , it is repetitive by repeating the same activities just with different content . My 3year old lost interest rather quickly .	1
I teach a preschool class , and I think this is the most helpful app I have . When there are only a few kids waiting to be picked up at the end of the day , we go bananas for this game . : )	1
I bought this May 2011 and my 3.y.o twins still love it and ask to play it all the time . Great game !	1
i so wish the creator of this app had more out there for kindle fire . we just love this game . our son plays it all the time and is already memorized fruit sight words . he is 3 and autistic and just started talking but he can already recognize the names of fruits even without the photos ! he loves it and we love that hes learning !	1
My three and a half year old son loves this game . It works great my tablet running 3.1 . I have a hard time getting my Transformer back when he plays this game !	1
My four year old liked it . It 's not hard , but it teaches matching and keeps her entertained ! ! It 's really cute !	1
I check the free Apps daily and have been looking for one that my granddaughter can play and learn from without having to pay for something she may not enjoy . This looks like great fun for her , thanks for including the little ones .	1
Probably my daughter 's favorite ipad app , now she can play on my droid . so glad to not have to pay for it twice thanks to amazon appstore today !	1
Got this for the grandkids and they liked it right away . My 3 year old twins can enjoy it as well as the 5 yr old .	1
if you have a child between the ages of 11/2 -5 this is the.app for them .My daughters love this app and so do i.well worth the purchase price .	1
This is a very cute and age appropriate game for toddlers . My son just turned 2 and loves this game . He is already a master at all the puzzles and matching game . I recommend highly ! And provides much needed electronic entertainment when we are out and about !	1
This adorable monkey has become a favorite of my little grandkids ! He challenges the children to count various items , play & # 34 ; matching & # 34 ; games , and identify letters . Each correct answer rewards the monkey with some food for his lunchbox . The monkey squeals with delight and jumps around each time he catches more food . This game is wonderful in every way , perfect for the tiny preschoolers .	1
Grandson in preschool just loves this game and always plays this one first . So many to choose from he tells me , he loves them all , but keeps coming back to this one . Yes , NANA approved ! : LOL	1
My 2 year old grandson loves playing this so much that I told his parents they need to get him a kindle so they can put games on them .	1
This app is very engaging for toddlers and they love to repeat the skills . They can learn shapes , colors , counting , and more.The only concern I have is that it does not exist like most Android apps . The only exit is with the `` home '' button .	1
Great game for my 2 year old son . Simple yet not too simple . He loves it . Getting reward stickers helps keep him interested . Overall super !	1
My 3 year old granddaughter had lots of fun with this game ; however , since she is preschool ready , although not attending yet , she zips through all the games . She lost interest after a few rounds . BUT , I would not dismiss this app because children learn differently , and your child/grandchild may have hours and hours of enjoyment from learning from all the puzzles/games . The monkey is fun to watch by itself as well . A great buy and well-worth it !	1
Granddaughter loves this application , this can keep her entertained for hours . she always wants to know what is next and what sticker she can use	1
This was a good choice for my two year old . It is easy enough she can do it by herself but also is a good learning tool . It keeps her attention , I would highly recommend this game	1
My 2 1/2 year old granddaughter absolutely loves this app . It keeps her entertained for quite a while- great for boring Dr appointment waits or whatever . She needed a little help with the puzzle part at first , but she 's getting the hang of it now .	1
My 2year old daughter likes the game but it did n't keep her attention as long as I had hoped . The game is a good educational activity but it does n't have many varieties of activities . It repeats itself too quickly and did n't keep her attention .	1
I have n't really spent much time on this app . My 4-year-old loves it and it gives stickers for playing games right . she enjoys that . She likes the puzzles too .	1
my 2yr old sons love it , but they do consistently reset it by inadvertently hitting the home or back button .	1
My 4-year-old loves this app ; it reinforces what she learns in preschool ( colors , letters , counting , etc ) n This WOULD be 5-stars except for what others have said : exits too easily & amp ; exiting causes you to lose all the stickers you earned . Should be a little more & quot ; childproof & quot ; especially considering the title , but overall a good app	1
A day ago 4 red dots were close to meI still remember who died in the family rest there soulsBut it 's kind of freakish ... I do n't care if it 's fake or notIt 's entertainment	1
at first I was so confused but I got the hang of it.see here 's the thing how do we know that it real because as I was reading the reviews it said that they said song red and other things.that was so funny to me because they say the same thing to me . I 'm not saying that people do n't say the same things at the same time.what I am saying is that as I read the reviews and play this so-co game I can tell that it uses the same words.do n't beloved nh option . just saying until we gather enough evdinfe than MAYBE we could belinlve that it is true until then I Robt think so.otherwise it is a fun so -go game u should downloaded it	1
Coolest ghost app ever ! It is real too , I was sitting in my bean bag chair and I had it on , my little sister had spilled chips on the floor , the ghost radar said robot , which freaked me out because we have an electronic robot that cleans , and it was on . It also said stepped , and as I was going to tell my mom , I stepped in the chips ! Another experience I had , I was on the couch , and my mom said to my baby sister , oh I need to change you ! I had the radar on and it said , diaper and stink , and my sister stunk ! So , if you believe in ghosts , get it ! If you do n't maybe you will ! This is a 100 star worthy app !	1
Fun idea , but obviously not legit . I was really hoping that I would get some answers - but what more can you expect from a free App.. ? I 'm enjoying watching the kids scratch their heads over why the ghosts in the house are saying & # 34 ; Union & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; Cup & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; Europe. & # 34 ; Ha !	1
Fun little app ! Nothing to take seriously but fun to spook out your friends . I like to take it out when I 'm walking around outside . It 's fun but again it 's just for fun . I can see where people may take it to heart and get freaked out . It 's just an app and something to pass the time ( like a game ) !	1
I bought this thinking I would delete it , but it turns out it is very good . I opened the app , then the word fire appeared on the screen . two days ago my dad told me that there was a fire in the house next door . BUY THIS APP ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
I do n't necessary believe it , bit things happened that could be debatable . I walked onto my parents room and my grandfathers ashes are in that little golden container thingy that they get put in and I put on the radar and it just about went crazy . and it said grandpa on the screen . so I ran out of the room creeped out , like a lot.another time it said Texas on the screen , this is stupid but Texas was thr answer to a game I was playing later.I would n't say I 'm totally convinced , but its more like 50/50	1
I do n't really believe in ghosts but after this app I might . So first we had a power outage and it ended up saying & quot ; solar & quot ; then & quot ; mistake & quot ; . Also it said & quot ; Christmas & quot ; and I know that Christmas is coming up . Plus I was in a room at night with my friends and it said & quot ; visitor & quot ; so we got scared and went into the kitchen and my friend was messing around with a bucket then it said & quot ; bucket & quot ; which also creeper me out but I think it 's worth it and pretty fun but at night it can definitely give you a scare .	1
I enjoyed reading all the reviews and that is the only reason I gave it a try . it said won-border-attack so obviously I am going to cancel my trip to Mexico after I win it ! ! ! !	1
I got ta say it is a little spooky . I 'm a truck driver and i downloaded this app while i was sitting in a shop parking lot . the first thing it said was parts . then it said p and kept putting the letter p across yeah i really had to bad . i went to find an mt trailer and it said flat and research . did n't . find a flat but when i checked inside trailer i found a huge hole in the roof . if I 'm to believe what they say there were a few ghosts around too . I do believe in ghost but i 'll have to do a little more researching to see if this is really a reliable ghost detector . all in all it is an interesting app .	1
I got the app and I lost my phone in my room and the app said I 'm , missing , warn , radio , many , lower , taste , valuable , and cry and the spooky thing is I was sad and did cry a little my phone is valuable I have eaten food in my room ( taste ) my room is in the lower part of my house and I have a radio and last but not least I 'm missing my phone this is creepy	1
I got this app because my friend recommended it . When I opened it I soon got the words ( In the order I got them ) store , Both , adult , children . I do n't know what it means , but it did slightly creep me out .	1
I got this for my kindle fire HD after I downloaded it I went into the kitchen it said there were ghost right next to me , the words did n't add up the only thing that added up was it said Rome the grassAfter that I was scared to go to bed ,	1
I got this game a few weeks after I saw the Conjuring . I did n't believe that spirit stuff could be THAT crazy or dramatic . Some kids at my middle school believe I 'm psychic . I sometimes see things , I sometimes hear things , and when I wake up in the morning after a dreamless sleep , I have ( a ) scratch ( es ) . I 'm not sure if I 'm going then myself or there is some sort of spirit who likes or hates me . I 've watched Celebrity Ghost Stories in the past but I stopped when I entered 5th grade two years ago . Now , as a seventh grader , I 'm not interested in this stuff anymore . I got this app to see how fake it was . Our parents were asleep so we ( my sister and I ) thought that was close to & quot ; alone & quot ; so I turned this on . We have had many pets before . They all died except one that I set free . When I started my homework , I saw a blue dot kind of behind-ish and right-ish . I looked at where you see communication and it said . I said hi and how are you . I said if you want me to turn it off to not die yourself . Nothing appeared so I kept my saying and came into here . This is a great app.Ooh ! Just now I realized a dog died next door . When I said & quot ; Bailey & quot ; two dots appeared . More coming soon !	1
I got this on my tablet and I went to the beach in florda ... ..ghosts were everywhere . So I hope it works on my kindle .	1
I guess this works , I do n't know . It detected ghosts in my house which is impossible seeing as we built it a little over 20 years ago and nobody has died there .	1
I just downloaded this app , but I have not used it yet ( it is 1:41 in the morning , I hope you see why not ) . My friend and I are interested in ghost stuff , so I am planning on bringing my kindle over next time we hang out : ] . Whether it is real or not , it should be some fun !	1
I just got this it is just for entertainment mine said & quot ; Began and Fighting & quot ; But its not real people do n't think its real	1
I know ghost are n't real but its good to scare little or older brothers it does ok trying to scare you PLEASE NOTE GHOST ARENT REAL DO NOT BELIEVE IN GHOST.HAVE FUN SCAREING OLDER OR LITTLE	1
I know this is just fun , but why does it give me the creeps when I have it on at night alone ? ? ? Still waiting for it to say a word that freaks me out !	1
I love this application . Its very fun and creepy to play with . I do believe in spirits and possibility for them to interact through this . & # 9733 ; & # 9734 ; & # 9733 ;	1
I 'm scared . I was scanning my room & amp ; it picked up the word 'pair ' and right next to me were a pair of my favorite voodoo dolls & deg ; ^ & deg ;	1
I opened it up and I got a signal and eventually when it moved closer it said nearer . and for all you curious . people it does n't say the word it just puts it on the screen under the title	1
I recently acquired some belongings of a world war II fighter pilot and stored them in my basement . since then I have noticed odd things happening down there . I decided to test this . for two nights I launched the app in different areas of the house . nothing happened . I then took it downstairs and launched near the pilots belongings . I got a green dot and the word massage came up . I looked down and my cat was at my feet . my mother then told me to come upstairs but I did n't want to . the green dot turned red and the word torn appeared . FREAKING AWESOME ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
It actually works ! ! So I have a dog and he always barks at nothing . I believe ghosts though and so does my friend . We think its a ghost he 's barking at . So I took this app one time he was barking and nothing was there but the radar said friend and dog with a red dot and it was on low too !	1
It freaked me out when I bought it . I thought green and red dots were something eles ... What are they anyway . After that my heart start racing ... looking around I tried to not think of it . Someone tell me what 's going on ? ! Freaking Scared ! ! !	1
It 's a fake . Me and a buddy had the same thing and we were right next to each other but it did n't have the same stuff . Sorry to you believers .	1
it 's an alright app because I lived in the same apartment for about six years now and if you stay up by yourself you 'll get scared for hearing footsteps and voices so this some what helps	1
it scared the living daylight 's out of.me when blue dots appeared dissapeared appeared . I am superstitious . and I 'm afraid of this kind of stuff . but if u r like me get it and b wit a friend when u do this . DONT B ALONE OR ULL BE LIKE ME ! ! ! I fell off my bed and ran into the living room , looked at my mom looked at me and went back to bed . I immedialy turned off my kindle and fell asleep . I had a dream of a ghost ! AHHHHHHH ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! but I liv it .	1
it was really cool but too creepy . I think my house is hunted so I got it and it was way to creepy I ca n't sleep now	1
it works . my house has been makeing weird noises and what not and the weird part is that there r three kids in the house my older brother born in march and it said march and showed one ghost and I 'm born in June I 'm the second oldest and it said June and showed two and my little brother was born in December and it said December then it also said men toinght and shoulder and i felt something on my shoulder so crazy and true	1
I was at walmart buyin me some shoes , and it said & quot ; lady & quot ; and about 10 seconds later a female worker came and asked if I needed help with anything , really weird	1
I was in my livingroom doing this app and it started listing instruments that I played . such as piano . then right where the piano was , it says musical and book . I was so scared ! ! ! ! ! ! the app is very accurate and I totally recommend it .	1
i was sitting down messing around with my kindle when i decide to open this app up . i was looking at it and it said a ghost was in my brother room . i walked in and it was only my cat in there . i started petting her then a red blip appeared right were my cat was at the same moment a word appeared at the top of the screen . it said & quot ; don't/stop/enjoy	1
I would say that this app is the real thing . it showed me that there was a ghost was by me and said & quot ; orange & quot ; and I was wareing orange cloths . this app is adiquit and I would recsmend it if you want to talk to your ghost .	1
My 4yr old daughter insists there 's a ghost in her room that usually manifests itself either shortly before or after bedtime . I downloaded this to prove there was nothing to be afraid of and took it in her room . Of course nothing was there , so thanks Ghost Radar ! Now if you can get busy on a & quot ; Monster Radar & quot ; app , that would be awesome !	1
my cousin has a ghost detector . when my ghosts show up her 's goes off like mine . even though she does n't believe i do . ugg . i 'm sure that ppl like me know and feel a ghost 's presence . i asked ghosts questions and they answered me . my cousin thinks that 's just a coincidence . i do n't . download this app and i guarantee if you believe in ghosts this app will work great	1
My friend Jackie and me had a fight at her house , and she got killed shortly after ( : ' ( ) . So when I went to her room ( the room she got killed in ) to clean up , I ran the app and immediately it picked up 'sorry ' ! ! ! OHMYGOD ! ! ! ! !	1
not the BEST app in the world because it said salmon now and banana when I was eating one ! ! ! omg get this app ! ! !	1
oh wow weird ! the first night i installed it and let it run . 3 things happened in less than a few hours . one , it said & quot ; john & quot ; ... my name is jon ! then it said & quot ; jonathon & quot ; creepy ! then i let my dog out side ... i let her out for a few minutes , came back and sat , then let her back in ... came back to the phone and it said the word & quot ; porch & quot ; ... right when my dog was out side waiting for me at the back door ! then tonight , i had to write this review ... i was out eating with my partner , and we left about 11:00 pm ... at 11:03 it said & quot ; transportation & quot ; weird weird weird ! lots of other weird words show up , many of them were just plain weird to be a coinsidance ! check this app out ! you 'll get hours of enjoyment ! trust me !	1
Ok so me and my cousins hunt ghosts . We think their condo is haunted . We see figures an get weird feelings . We want to know if it 's true or not . I have n't tried it there yet but we think it might work . So we r still hoping .	1
ok so only reason I put this on a four cause it scared the beejeebers out of me ! ! I had it on for first time and pointed at my dad and he looooves fruit so he was eating oranges and the word that came up was fruit ! ! solo weird !	1

( its not ) . but i was in my bed and it seid : lexi my sister thats her name so the next dat she was in the hospital with stiches ! ! ! CREEPY CREEPY CREEPY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1

o my gosh this scared the living he*l out of me when i first turned it on it said & quot ; devil & quot ; it scared me cause it kept getting closer ill put it on one more time and see me get more scared ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
once I blew a airhorn and it said & quot ; again & quot ; so I did then I said to my cousin we should fight to see if there is a reasponse and it said & quot ; do n't & quot ; creepy right I think it is real	1
( owners son ) It 's a fun app but I do n't like how it blurts out random stuff . I was pretending to hunt ghosts when it randomly said & quot ; potatoes & quot ; that was a big cuincedence concidering that I was next to a sack of them but then it only said things like & quot ; eagle & quot ; and & quot ; cheese & quot ; and I was in the living room . Fun app though . I like randomness .	1
really creepy when I walk down my hallway I always feel a tingling thing on my back like a spider so I used this thing and told me their was a ghost right behind me ! but I do n't like the crappy voice	1
So I GOT this app and it showed two dots and its saying words like fog slipped and attached can someone tell me what the red yellow and green dots mean	1
the fist 2 seconds I Tuesday it I picked up something and it worked I was looping on this dudes head .	1
this app is great it makes everything more spooky now that I know there are a few ghosts in the attic .	1
This app is neat . Its funny to think if there are really ghosts among us . This app is great . It is a lot of fun .	1
This app is pretty weird . I was sitting in my living room and my brother was playing video games , and it said April . That 's my brother 's birth month . Then it said border when I was trying to extend the borders of my country in & quot ; My Country & quot ; . This app is awesome for me because I am a 100 % ghost believer . I regimens to believers .	1
This app is real . Cause I have a fire place and it said fireplace . Then said orderAnd said would . C r e e p y .	1
this is a skary game but its fun my brother loves this game.if it finished the sentences it would be much better I still give it a 5 star	1
this is freaky . the voice that tell you where the ghosts are is freaky and kids ... .. do n't use this in the dark . over all I really like this game ... . besides . the fact that it scared me a few times	1
this is so real l caught a ghost in the park and I freak out if I see another one I am going to screem my lungs out .	1
this is weird cause my mom was on her phone my bro was on the computer and my tv was going and it did n't pick up anything and they were all by each other so it should put off a strong signal but it did n't so that 's weird the . first time I turned it on it was picking up strange moving signals and it said stuff like cow and none and other stuff and the second time it did n't pick up anything up so the gohsts escaped without letting me know . ( FREAKY ) letting me know freaky .	1
This thing is awesome , I started to walk around my house , It said & quot ; tobacco & quot ; . My dad sucks on tobacco , I said & quot ; hey that 's what my dad does & quot ; and when I said that it popped up & quot ; replied & quot ; , spooky ! ! ! ! !	1
Today I was in the hallway and I had this app on and it said principal , and sure enough my principal was coming down the hall towards me	1
usaully I 'm very paranoid and very suspicious so getting this app was n't . the brightest idea . .. . however it was interesting to see how many ghosts were at my local arby 's ! however it was very creepy when i was twirling my hair and it said , & quot ; soft & quot ;	1
When I first started using it , I was sceptical . One of the first words was & quot ; Chicago & quot ; , then & quot ; James & quot ; , and factory . My Dad , James , lived in Chicago and welded in a factory . One night , my son called me to come and pick him up . This was unexpected . When I got back home , I turned it on . The words were , son , telephone , pick up . Now , you tell me !	1
when I first used this app I heard Atlantic and five minutes later I find out that I 'm right next to the border of the Atlantic and these past couple minutes ive heard & quot ; Kepler composed John experienced cheif gentle Norway character local crew burn front its face . And right after that I got Greek breeze keep lying position develop shouting parrelel , all In at least thirty minutes or less.this app works or not but it will freak you out if you let it or unless it says background knowledge about you .	1
When I was in my room I had my kindle turned on to this app.It kept saying stuff that did n't make sense but after an hour when it started getting dark out , there was at least six red dots on my screen , they were all around the screen but one did not move.I looked on the screen I thought it was actually really close to where I was sitting , it then said shoulder.I got a little freaked.I also asked some questions about back then when JFK was around and I said I bet he was a great president , it said agreed , I know what happend to the people in the house it was in the 60s they were around so I suggest if you know when the people lived in that house ask it questions when they were around , it really does work trust me .	1
good hidden object game . if you like hidden object games give it a try . I 'm addicted to them so I love it	1
It tells me that my dads couch spot is haunted . its worth it ! I recommend this app to all ghost lovers and mystery lovers ! scares you a little but is F-U-N-N-Y ! I got a couple of words like ; ' below ' and 'someone ' . When I saw 'below ' I thought basement , which we always thought was haunted . When it said 'someone ' I looked at the window and there was a wasp trying to get in .	1
The greed gaympppruzas fire high huff getting yrs guiding yards yrs harder trends added through th uhh much Hirsch hubbub g th hugging . Hugger g th hugging g th uhh	1
the app is amazing . me and my freinds do stuff and the app says stuff realated to what we did . the app is spooky but I love the app .	1
This thing was awesome . I said to my friend in the dark that there was no ghost in the closetThen something on the screen said darkness so I got my water gun and went to the closet.My friend was now insane and he went crazy so I sprayed him like 7 times and I got my room wet . : )	1
This was a fun app to play with . My kids enjoyed it as well . With Halloween coming up I will be using it to freak people out .	1
As soon as I got in the app there were 3 red dots . A little more than a year ago I lost 3 great grandparents all in one day . It said great , grand , daughter , and miss	1
I just bought the game and opened it I was leasing with my hair then it said hair then a blue dot alerted behind me I closed the app after that have n't had it more than 3 minutes	1
okay so I was at my great grandmas house and I put it by her doll case ( she makes dolls by hand ) and 6 dots showed up and it said & quot ; child & quot ; and that was reallllly creepy . I think it works I just like it because its entertaining . I just did it again and a red dot showed up in my room and it said & quot ; yard & quot ; and that 's where my dog Is burried . I loved my dog a lot too . he died in December . first day of winter break at school . ( he was a Corgi blue healer mix so he was like a giant corgi )	1
So I was sitting on the couch ... playing my kindle fire ... and well it was really scary cause ... I live in Norway and it said & quot ; Norway & quot ; then after that I wanted to go swimming ... and it said & quot ; swimming & quot ; and the time was noon ... . and it said & quot ; noon & quot ; and I put the kindle fire down on the couch ... . and ran outside screaming** )	1
Super creepy . it said something but I got so scared that I exited the app before it was done talking	1
I work in a building that is 150 years old . I was going # 2 in the bathroom and it told me a ghost said `` light '' , `` match '' . C'Mon ! My stomach is a little upset.. give me a break , it cant smell that bad ?	1
Great app but had to uninstall because it would not transfer to as card and I am out of internal memory . That is why it is 4 stars and not 5	1
I really like this app . I was watching You Tube on my Xbox and the radar said & quot ; Tube. & quot ; It was creepy !	1
Love all the different kinds of ghost and the ghosts say words and u can see where about the ghosts are at in your room..	1
so for the past few days I have been expirencing weird things the past couple days . the scariest thing was when I was completely alone and I heard a loud growl in my ear . so when I saw this app and did n't really believe it would work . but when I turned it on there was a red dot next to my Christmas tree and then it said & quot ; wrapped & quot ; I was super creeper out ! !	1
this app is really weird what do the red dots mean ? there evrywere ! this may sound strange but I can see most I know this sounds strange but I can talk to them last night a really scathe one came in my dream with brown hair never brushed or showered holding a basket full of cat heads and an army of headless cats behind her and she said & quot ; you cant save the one who sees & quot ; I 'm the one who sees if you find me ever I can prove it later	1
when I used this at home ... it said ..you cold shiver random jinn ... what surprised me is it said a jinn it means sin or devil ghost ... and jinns are real ... and um ... I freaked out I could n't stop shivering just like it said I would shiver ... then it kept.on saying danger and then it said pray or die in not heaven ... ..uhhhh ... .	1
i downloaded it and thought it was fake but then ... ... ... i was playing around with it and it traked a ghost of a person who had the nickname of & quot ; the jones & quot ; and the word appeared & quot ; jones & quot ; and tons of other stuff but ... ..ill bore you	1
Ok my dad just got back from work for his lunch break and then it said job , next he turned on the tv and it said television . Creepy I 'm 12kinda believe in ghosts wo n't do this when I 'm alone . My mom has got to try this she is a huge believer and she is just amazed by ghosts . I would rate more but it creeps me out and makes me scared	1
This app is really creepy.One day I was sitting on the couch with my Chihuahua and he 's small so I turned on the app and a couple minutes later it said little.then I was playing Xbox and then it said Game.Then a week later it said friend then my friend came over.Is it real or not .	1
um ... so a couple weeks ago i had a friend over and she told me to put on the ghost hunter app well i did and i havethis bracelet on my ankle i took it off and the ghost detector said push with a red dot and so i got up to put tue bracelet back on all of a sudden it felt like some one pushed me ( i didnt get hurt ) i asked my friend if she pushed me and she said no . and i can tell when she is lying . so its creepy u ppl should get it	1
Well , I 'm not that sure whether to believe this app or not . Me and my cousin were just messing around looking for ghost apps and we found this , and downloaded it . We were just watching the words out whatever and it kept saying 'ffee ' and we were confused . At the top it said 'Get'and that kinda scared me . I tried joking around and trying to communicating to the 'ghost ' . At the top , it said 'Observe ' . My cousin said , & amp ; # 34 ; What is your name ? & amp ; # 34 ; And it said 'Joe ' and then a huge yellow dot appeared in front of us , and the top said 'Shimmering ' It scared me really badly , and I deleted the app instantly . Not because I do n't like it , because I was FREAKED OUT . You choose whether to believe it or not..	1
well its entertaining thats for sure . only says one word at a time , but its fun by the campfire telling ghost storys then freak the kids out : )	1
When i first got this app , i was a little skeptical about it but tried it anyway cuz im 13 like what 13 yr old would n't get this ? ! XD so anyways i was changing in my laundry room with this app on and the word appeared & quot ; change & quot ; i freaked out and told my parents but they wer just laughing at me , it 's real like 80 % of the time i recommend trying it out it 's pretty cool ! ! ! : D	1
I downloaded this today , I was bored in bed have n't been feeling well . As soon as I turned it on it said > Maria & lt ; and last night I had a dream with an old acquaintance & that 's her name . It then said Jack , Army , Knife , Rifle . I do have a knife next to my bed gift from my son a Marine . I came downstairs , where I have all my pets , a small dog , a very playful kitten , and 3 birds . It repeated like four times > animal & lt ; and when the kitty started running around and playing it kept repeating > energy & lt ; My dog was biting her nails on her left paw , and that 's what it said > bite & lt ; > left & lt ; . Then it said > Barbara & lt ; and that 's the name of the street I live in . I 've had paranormal experiences since a young age , so this does n't scare me its quite fun . If you know how to use it and what to ask , believe me its worth to download .	1
I got this app and when I tried it out alot of dots appeared it was scary then I was in the kitchen pouring a cup of koolade and it says & quot ; pleasant & quot ; I told my sis to come in the kitchen and I tell her what happened and after I was done it said & quot ; correct & quot ; we freaked out .	1
I was sitting down stairs watching Tv and it said chang so I changed the channel for a split second and a dot showed up and then vanished just as quick as the channel changed back	1
This app is no joke , brah . Works real well , not many lags , and freaked out my friend 's nephew ! Worth your time . And the messages do n't repeat , just proof this is real .	1
me and my friend like 2 use this app a lot.we espescially use it when we 're in his basement with all the lights out and we 've been getting a lot of activity.Eventually we started taking pictures with our phones when a ghost would appear and we 've gotten some shots with orbs and unexplained mists . ( we think it is real )	1
I had my eye on this app 4 a long time but was too afraid to get it . my cousin was over tonight and we were both terrified to get it but she talked me in to it so I got it . for the first couple times it said random words like & quot ; goes & quot ; or & quot ; wagon & quot ; . but after a couple hours it said July which is when my cousin 's birthday is . she freaked and we were so scared ! :0	1
I love this game but it is very scary . I got it about a month ago and it said grandmother . my grandmother died so this is scary ; /	1
I got this app once before and a friend and I decided to put it to the test in her dads home which is a & quot ; historical monument & quot ; and has been around for ages and is haunted . so when we put it to the test it started saying things like & quot ; single , Buddy , lazy , Tv , footsteps & quot ; and more which was creapy as we were both single , her cat Buddy was laying with us , we were being lazy and watching Tv and then we heard footsteps right behinde us which is super creapy when you 're home alone in a haunted house . so after that we decided to put it to the test at her moms house which is a smaller ranch style house and it started saying things like & quot ; nine , cats , Tim & quot ; which was also weird as she has 9 cats and we were holding her brothers mouse Tim . now our last two tests came up when we came to my house ( the next day ) where it was having a field day going off with all this country crape and my house is only 5 years old and were the only people who have lived in it but the words & quot ; pitbull , fighting , drugs , fire , gun and beer & quot ; came up which was freaky because earlyer that year we had found out more on the history of my neighborhood and there were people ( before this was a neighborhood ) who bred and fought pits here and were wanted by the police for drugs and we had found the burnt remains of some of this . so we took it to the old barn where it was crazy we did n't know what to do as word after word came up & quot ; cow , barn , plow , old & quot ; and more . then today it decides to remind me that I 'm single and am laying in bed with my cat ... .to many to be a coincide .	1
I just walked in the spare bedroom with the app on . I 've been trying to decide what to do with the room and the first word said was & quot ; decide & quot ; . Then a blue dot showed up right where my mothers urn is in that same room . I do n't know whether to laugh or change my shorts !	1
I just got this , and so far it 's done nothing but scan . However , it has inspired a creepy story that I want to write . That alone earns 5 stars .	1
I like this app a lot . It is simple but precise . Not a lot too it , but fine for what it is .	1
Just reading these reviews are worth paying for app . This has been thoroughly entertaining . You can take it seriously or not . Doesnt matter . Its free .	1
According to this app , it 's 'scientific'ly 'correct ' I will be 'hanged ' by the 'Japanese'.Ghost Radar is an application that supposedly detects spirits with your device . Good layout and great for young children . It 's up to you to believe if this is real or not . I use it mainly for creativity purposes .	1
Works great on Tmobile G2 . One of the most important applications on Amazon it helps you detect ghosts and spirits . I already found a ghost in my bedroom .	1
had it on for 10 minutes and no words or ghosts ! my house has no ghosts ! wan na send some over here ? lol	1
Great FAOTD . Started the app started to show words on Vox and in the Radar . Funny thing in the Radar was showed location and word & quot ; creature & quot ; , I look towards the area it pointed and it was my dog . jeje , great app for Halloween	1
my house is free of ghost ... except one who knew inwould spread and strecth far the accuracy of this app ... its is cool for halloween thou	1
This app is good ! Not the best but definitely worth a dollar ! But the reason its 4 stars is because there are different colors of ghosts and there is no key to defining what they stand for . Other than that , good job !	1
Decent app , works on my phone with no negitive effects . Weither it ACTUALLY percieves the super natural or paranormal is unknown . However , even if not , it is a fun entertainment piece just in time for halloween .	1
I ca n't wait for the next app to come out of beta . demon sonar . every time I try to find the demons in the toilet bowl after drinking the ghosts make the app crash by shorting out my phone . we need an app that can keep up with todays ever more aggressive sprite world	1
IT SCARES THE FLIP OUT OF ME ! Seriously even my mom believes it so look so scary . Get this app it scary and fun.if you really wan na be scared bring it to a graveyard at night !	1
OK , wow . I have a couple tales to tell : When I felt like something was wrong , I went outside and the ghost radar said & quot ; safe & quot ; which made me happy for some odd reason.The next time I used it , the radar said & quot ; press & quot ; , and you know when you press the screen it automatically goes to the tracking thing , so I did and it showed a green orb sitting by me . So ... that was ... . weird.Last of all , It showed to red orbs where my smoking neighbors were . I knew they were evil ... That 's pretty much it so far . I recommend this for a lot of people , it 's fun .	1
Fun app , I wish the vox mode would still be scanning while I look at the radar , so that I can compare the two to see what 's the ghosts intentions are . I started wearing clothes aroused the house because the ghosts were making me feel selfconcious.The first word that came out for me was not fart , but it was the second . Some eerily accurate words . It said the word power right before I unplugged it from the wall.Fun app , solid , entertaining , HTC EVOthe nudist	1
so i was scratching my dogs belly , and the word & quot ; nice & quot ; came up.when i stopped , it said , & quot ; why & quot ; so i scratch ed his belly again and it said & quot ; nice & quot ; .weird ...	1
my sisters best friend died a day before i bought this app ... the word girl popped up , then the word orange . orange was the girls favorite color ...	1
The app even says it should be used for entertainment purposes and it says that the accuracy is not proven real ... .so stop writing bad reviews and read the description ! ! ! ! This app is really cool the first time I opened it was with my dog and cat in my room and it said there was a ghost/spirit and the words were & quot ; kids & quot ; and & quot ; combine & quot ; I found that really cool ! : )	1
I 'm loving the negative comments from & quot ; experts. & quot ; M.D.s do n't get mad about the x-ray apps , so why are you mad about this ? Most of the comments have shown that people are n't REALLY taking this seriously , so why are you ? Lighten up . This is a fun app to have for Halloween.By the way , if you could provide proof that your custom home-made equipment works better than this app , I 'm sure we 'd all love to see it . No , I did n't think so .	1
A ghost just followed me at 70 mph , talking the entire time . Funny app for the kids this close to Halloween . The words make it creepy on a fun way . Thanks Spud Pickles .	1
I got the game after reading the reviews and thought it would be fun just to try it even though I was pretty certain it was bogus . A part of me sorta hoped that my little brother would find some way to communicate with me even though I know the kindle does n't have a microphone . See he killed himself last July and I miss him so badly . Anyways , I started the game and walked around and got some random words like question and paragraph . I got bored and sat on the couch . Not much happened after that so I figured it needed movement so I started shaking it . Soon words came popping out but I froze when the word brother came up . The next word was beside . I kid you not ! I could n't help tearing up even though it was probably just random words that happened to sync up . Nothing interesting after that but it shook me a little .	1
I decided to check this application out . I have a ghost right in front of me , but all the detector picked up on was the pixies in my sock drawer and the monster snoozing under my son 's bed.I 'd recommend installation of the application only to detect supernatural , not paranormal , activity . It does n't even sense my inner demons or the ghost in the machine !	1
Jesus came and said hello he said that I was the best and that j might not want to vote for Michelle . bachman because shes truly a monstrr made by the government to destroy us But.maybe I 'm imagining this beacause everyone knows.Jesus would talk to Tebow First	1
I have this app on my kindle and my phone only for entertainment sake . I have no idea if it 's fake or real . I gave both to my grandkids one night and they had a blast running around the house looking for ghost ! ! ! It can be a little spooky when it starts talking to you ! ! Now if only I can get my phone and kindle back whenever my darling little monsters are around ! ! !	1
This app is on my Kindle Fire . One evening as I walked by the TV with my Kindle Fire in my hand and the app turned on it said TV . As I sat down on the sofa beside my cat it said Mona , my cats name . Other times it 's been on money with its answers and words . Let it warm up with all 3 lights on and enjoy what 's said and what energies are around you . Could fun or could be serious .	1
i got this just for the fun of it . turned it on and started playing with it . I have to say it is pretty freaking creepy at times . I was showing it to my son when it said & quot ; railroad & quot ; . he was playing a game and his computer guy was on a railroad . we had said nothing about a railroad.Other weird ones are when I was talking about my mom and it started with words like Texas , health , camp ... things that relate to her . I said nothing about those things.Or it said & quot ; government traffic & quot ; my phone went nuts , the app force closed , wouldnt open , glitched and then i had to download it again . Started it up and the first thing it said was & quot ; see & quot ; . trippy ! My son said his stomach hurt and it said & quot ; corn & quot ; . sure enough he had eaten something with corn and was feeling the effects . the phone wasnt even with me when he ate.Its just weird , fascinating and creepy . just said & quot ; Saturday , worker & quot ; . I work on Saturday.So if its a gimmick , its a darned convincing gimmick . But the next time I lose my my keys again , i am turning it on b/c when i was searching for mine it said & quot ; table & quot ; . they were there . I dont usually keep my keys on the table . i lose them if i do.I 'm a little freaked out now .	1
Having watched the Ghost Hunter shows on television and enjoyed them I was familiar with some of their tools . I thought I would give this a try ... .I figured this was probably just a fun thing to play with . When I operated it and it analyzed the room I was in and later listed the events in that room . I was shocked . Both my mother and father had died about 15-20 years ago . My dad had always promised to come back and let me know if he was ok after he passed ... well he did within a week one night when I went to bed and could n't sleep . I saw this man smiling at me and it scared me so I jumped out of bed and he disappeared . The next day as I set at my desk I looked up to see the photo he had given me of his time in the Navy in Australia and here was the handsome wavy black haired man that had smiled at me . He had always said that was the happiest time of his life . Well when the Ghost Radar Legacy listed the events that happened it mentioned the word mill ... .my dad had worked for years in the saw mill ... .I knew then that he was still watching over me . This was no coincidence ... .out of millions of words that could have popped up ... .also it mentioned struggle and he had a horrible time his last few hours ... .So this is very worth trying out . I can not guarantee you will have a connection like I did but many have and if you do it will be amazing .	1
idont know of it 's real or not burning tell the kids if they do n't behave I 'm gon na find the ghost.. lol I know it sounds mean but I 'm just kidding . I actually freak myself out more then them . lol good entertaining app .	1
It was midnight . I was in my room and I got my ghost radar out . Then I went around the house . And I went in the darkest room . Then the ghost radar went crazy ! ! ! There where dots all over the screen . Then I saw a lot of moving green blobs everywhere . Then I ran for my life.And got back in bed . But I did n't erase it.idk why .	1
This is a great app . I 've successfully detected many ghosts and other activity from the paranormal . One of the ghosts freaked out when he realized I was using this app . Might want to add some stealth sensors like the stealth bomber..other than that , this app rocks !	1

These reviews are the best ever ! I had to read all of them ! Seriously , people , this app is just for fun . Boo to the people giving 1 star reviews because you think the concept is stupid !	1
I took my phone to a border town in Mexico the other day . I always assumed that ghosts in Mexico speak Spanish or Aztecan . NOPE ! The ghosts in Cuidad Juarez speaky English . Great news for ghost hunters that can only speak English . Seems that English is the language of the dead !	1
I have not used this app but I had to review and give 4stars for the awesome amount of trolls reviewing . I ca n't say as to the developers intent in making this as a troll or not but the reviews of this crap made my morning .	1
After years and years of research , interviews , photos , and a dozen documentaries . It seemed we only lacked the technology to find our answers ... .me and my kindle fire have determined Lee Harvey Oswald did it.Now me and my radar are off to find marilyn next .	1
we just returned from Disney did not have kindle with me there was a message . from my deceased son father . park on that day my husband was on our sons . favorite ride	1
It really is a hoot when take the phone outside and hold it up and it speaks LAKE , and theres a lake right across the street ! Pointing at my car said OIL ! Then TELL US YOUR NAME said DANNY ! And asking it about its family said SISTER ! Then I was badgering it , and it told me QUIET ! It was enough to scare the beejeebers outta my family ! LOVED IT , especially around Halloween time !	1
this one time my cousin and I were sitting in a room . then we heard a banging sound about 5 times in the next room when it was only us 2 there at the time so we got the radar and and got a dot on the radar behind the living room door . then the door knob twisted and said & quot ; open & quot ; . that got me out of the house for a few minutes	1
This is n't going to be a snarky review with a lame attempt at being humorous . It 's going to be serious . I am a skeptic at heart as should all people be . If you already have your mind made up then you 're wasting your time . What freaked me out were the words the thing said . I always dismiss things when possible or discount them as coincidence , but enough coincidence equals an affirmation . Not there yet , but this is still interesting . The first word it said was & quot ; lying & quot ; which is exactly what was on my mind about a friend . Then it said a name of a friend of mine . It said the name of another friend , his Dads name , and then his cats name . Then it said & quot ; sing & quot ; which is an inside joke between us . Of course it 's more than likely coincidence , but it still gave me a slight freakout . Now if I talk to my freinds tomorrow and they happened to be thinking about me when the words were spoken ... . that 's what would freak me the frak out . Interesting app allegedly fake or not . What harm does an open mind have ?	1
Mine goes off all the time . I can pick it up and it will say there has been words spoken even if I am not using this app.. weird .	1
So if you honestly disliked this app because of technical issues or if you just thought it was poorly created , then by all means , write a review . But will people please stop discouraging believers with comments like & quot ; you all are idiots if you believe In ghosts ! They 're not real ! & quot ; I mean did you REALLY come on here just to complain about other people ? Other than that , this app , to me , is fun and creepy : D	1
Freaky little app . It said Degree , mine are waiting to be hung in this room and Rome , there is a pic of Rome in the room I had forgotten about ! Ok , good app . But , Zombie Radar , now that would be useful ... ..	1
I have the free ghost radar classic . This looks like an updated version . Anyways I 'm going to stick with the free ghost radar classic only because I do n't like paying my money for an app that has a free version . Lets get down to the facts . The radar I have Wichita many of you have had or heard of works like this one . This one has more features is all . I do believe in spirits . I believe they do not want to hurt us . I believe they like to try to get help known as lost souls . I use the free version of this whenever I get the chance . There are over 10 different responds I got that makes me believe its real . I do n't remember all ten but I remember my first one . I was in my reclining chair and opens the app , I put Mt blanket on and was relaxed , it then said comfortable . I was like ok , was n't too impressed . then I went to lay back and it said relaxed . I thought ok 2 fluiks . I went to close my eyes and it said rest . I almost threw my kindle on the ground amazed at what I heard and saw . I told my family that lives with me and they said it might be real . So I went to breathe and the room was n't cold , but I saw my own breath , then it said hello . I then believed from that moment on that there is really an after life , I knew since I was little that God is real ! through the reading I found that God is yes very real . Spirits can contact us , and this is an app that truely proves it . The free version is the one I 'm talking about . Get this if you want it , get the free version , ghost radar is an amazing experience , I hope you find what I did if not more .	1
I was a bit skeptical about how well this app would work upon seeing it as the FAOTD . I 'm usually not one to turn the daily free app away , especially when it could be a handy tool , so I downloaded it . Needless to say , I was impressed . Do n't be fooled by the developers claims that this is merely for entertainment purposes . This is a serious tool , and after many test runs around my house I found it to be 100 % accurate . It is not to be taken lightly.This software inspired me to quit my job and pursue my lifelong dream of being a professional ghost hunter . I may not have any experience or know much about the field , but & quot ; Ghost Radar & quot ; is all I need for ghost bustin ' . I 've already set up my website and everything . I 've even got my first client . A pastor from an old haunted church . I intend to show that congregation more than just the holy ghost ! They 'll be so impressed by this technology and my ability to operate it.Thanks Amazon and Ghost Radar for making dreams come true !	1
You ca n't detect anything in highly populated areas . Now when you 're alone , that 's when it gets interesting . Cool app , but beware playing with this alone ( especially at & quot ; Dead Time & quot ; [ 3am ] ) , hehehehe ... .	1
I herd it say 'death kill out out kill now go 'then a ton of red dots apereed then slowly came to the center and then I felt a burning and I was covered in scraches	1
so I was sitting on the couch with my dad and he was telling me not to believe it because its fake but then one of the words the ghost & quot ; say & quot ; was James ... my dads name ... . so yeah ... .	1
I enjoy knowing that we are never alone . it is a bit creppy to see some of the words but it is fun to play with this apt .	1
I dont know if its real or not but its definitely entertaining ... ... ..and more than a little creepy if you have it on while alone in the semi-dark of your house lol.It works great on my Streak 7 '' running Froyo 2.2 but my 10 '' thrive running honeycomb 3.1 its too small on screen.Still fun tho : - )	1
I just watched Rocky on tv yesterday . I just installed this app and the first word it said was Rocky.I immediately shut it off so it would n't tell my wife things I did n't want it to.Be careful ... .	1
Does what it claims but too many false positives . I have a globe with a sheet draped over it in my office and this thought it was a ghost . An understandable mistake but I expect more from the zero dollars I paid.Also too many permissions . Ectoplasmic sensors ? Protease detectors ? Astral plane coarse and fine location ? Come on , devs ! Why do you need all this ?	1
it said the ghost said barrios and trap I 'm so s fared after the words he said I got the chills and the ghost greencircle turned to red	1
I love this app . I just wish the words which when they are spoken could be a larger sized text . I can see it but my eyes are bad . I have glasses but still wish the text was larger . Please developer do something to make the words that are spoken larger or have a setting to make them larger . Other than that this is an Awesome app ! ! !	1
I was seeing how this worked so when I opened it up it said & quot ; sail & quot ; and my brother and I were like oookkk ? But after that we went up stairs for a second and I told him & quot ; How hard is your heart beating ? & quot ; And he said I 'm not scared u know and I told him I read one of the coments and it said & quot ; My dog barked after the radar said & quot ; bark & quot ;	1
I do n't know why , but I this is the first app I check when I open my tablet . I got ta know what the ghosts are saying while I 'm gone . I think I 'm obsessed ...	1
My kids and I enjoyed this for something different , but I do n't know that it actually works . I do n't see how my Kindle Fire could make this thing work , but again , we had fun .	1
Long time ago a super in my building fell down the freight elevator pit and die ... The current operator was working here so he told me the story.As i walk through the freight the words & quot ; fight flies & quot ; come up and when i get right in front of the car doors & quot ; forgotten & quot ; pooped upThat is my spooky story ... The app works !	1
This app seems to work really good if you in fact think you have energies within your home . We constantly hear noises that are not just your normal household noises and when we turn on the Ghost Radar it almost immediately picks up energy orbs within our house .	1
I 've been happily dead for 300 years , and now people keep coming and asking me to talk to them . Do n't people in your century have anything to entertain you ? Maybe you should go and watch television or surf the Internet , whatever those things are.PS . & quot ; Woooooooh ! & quot ;	1
Probably the most sophisticated and customizable ghost radar app on the market.I like the quaint WWII radar look.You also have advanced settings which require some knowledge in radio technology.Spoken events are rendered with the popular bizbot voice and logged.Still , I see it more as entertainment than a serious application to detect real ghosts - though I 'm open-minded either way .	1
i had it on while i was watchig a movie & the ghost started commenting on what was happening on the TV screen ! ! !	1
how do you change the settings ? ? ? I just do n't no one person said they changed the settings to ghost to fairy just how ? ? ?	1
Guess that depends on your beliefs . Do you believe in ghost ? Witnessed firsthand when asking an entity ? his name , and without saying his name , ghost radar did , on cue . Everybody FREAKED OUT ! Awesome app , Thanks to the developer and Amazon for making this app free.Request for the developer to make this app dual-screen compatible kyocera echo owner ) Now you can see dead people ... .with ghost radar ... muahahahaha ! ! ! !	1
It seems to work well enough , it picks up the ghost sitting next to me , but not the cat ghost in the window . ( - ; But it is good enough that I 'm sure it will amuse my kids on Halloween .	1
Used the ghost radar and thought it was a joke . Found nothing in shed , backyard ( where I buried my pet mouse george ) . Then when my homie Wilbur came over he messed around with the settings . Then sure enough , after smashing some keystone light cans on out heads , and jamming some Megadeath , and it found ghosts in the basement ! we called over my friend chuck who can make contact with ghosts and who has crop circles on his farm and has had his rectum probed by aliens first hands , he spoke with the ghosts and said the house was built on a sacred Indian burial grounds with treasures from Christopher Columbus . Wibur and I said screw it , and I 'm leasing the house anyways so we jack hammered the foundation . After hours of digging we found real gold coins ... .. We 're poring the concrete back now ... ...	1
This app freaks me out because every word it pulls up is in a sentence and I ca n't tell if the color of the dots means good , evil and in between but it freaks me out I do n't think you should get it if you 're younger than 11 years old ! Good game though !	1
I WAS AT MY GRANDMAS AND I DECIDED TO GET THIS APP . SO I ASKED WITH MY BROTHER IF THERE WAS A MINER HERE . THEN A VOICE POPED UP SAYING GOLD MINER ! THAT CREEPED US OUT .	1
Loads of fun with the grandkids . We went on a ghost hunt and had tons of laughs . It was well worth it to watch the kids running around testing things .	1
Is this for real ? Or is it just for show ? Who knows ! I have used it in known & # 34 ; haunted & # 34 ; places . We have a friend who gets all upset when you talk about ghosts . Its fun to freak her out .	1
Tried the app few minutes ago and it found many ghosts . Started showing words like , & quot ; fall & quot ; , & quot ; man & quot ; , & quot ; stairs & quot ; , and & quot ; end & quot ; . And while I was playing with this app I was n't watching where I was going and I fell down the stairs and died . Now I 'm a ghost writing this review ! !	1
I downloaded Ghost Radar Classic ( free ) first . I got such a kick out of it that I splurged ( $ .99 ) and bought Ghost Radar . I have freaked out my 18-year-old daughter , and friends . Sometimes it spouts off words that make you go `` hummm . '' For instance I had it running ( on my KFire ) one morning as I was getting ready for work . I walked out into the hallway where one of my cats was sitting and suddenly the radar said `` feed '' . Yes indeed the cat was waiting for me to feed him.Most of the time it says things that do n't make much sense but I get a kick out of it just the same . Yes , I am easily amused . : )	1
That being said , this application is a blast and it is fun to watch people fawn over it . If I knew earlier that all it took was a random word generator and a fake radar graphic to make people freak out as if I was some sort of medium with an Android phone ... I would have written this app myself . This is genius and really fun to play with ! But anybody that thinks it 's real and can actually talk to spirits ? I would seriously question their sanity .	1
So , a few minutes after I got this app I hopped in the shower . FYI , I 'm the kind of person who sings in the shower . So , I 'm singing Rock God by Selena Gomez and I get out . I was sceptical of ghosts and I thought this was a joke . so I mutter to myself , & quot ; Yeah , I 'll get some words from the other side , & quot ; I go to the Words column and I literally gasp with shock . it says , Please , Sing , louder . I 'M LITERALLY GOING TO DIE . THIS THING IS STALKING ME . then , yesterday , this ghost named Chuck was calling me names . He called me Fatty , Loser , and the B word . I 'm sad.-T.S .	1
Fun app to play with , uncanny how intuitive it can be	1
I downloaded this for free , just in time for Halloween , for my kids to play with . My daughter made fun , at first , but her younger brother loved it . It struck his imagination , and he started ghost-hunting immediately . After dark , even the teenager got in on the fun.The only problem I 've found is that it KILLS YOUR BATTERY FAST . The app says it basically uses all if your sensors , microphone , etc. , so I 'm sure that is why , but keep it in mind.I 'm not saying it 's a great ghost-hunting tool , but it 's a cute little app that has given my kids hours of fun .	1
oh my gosh this thing totally works I think me and a ghost are becoming friends I mean real friends .	1
I ca n't vouch 100 % for this apps authenticity , but it is creepily accurate . I was picking up a few words that seemed meaningless . Then , jokingly , I said , & quot ; what 's your name ? & quot ; About five seconds later the word & quot ; William & quot ; came up . In another instance my little brother threw a can in the garbage can and the word & quot ; score & quot ; popped up . It creeped me out just a little . Love the app though and it 's really neat	1
totally necessary . my periods are annoying and im always surprised when I get them even though I know when therye coming but not exactly and this helps ... and @ ahh ... if a child sees this then u should tell them its none of their business . geez ... why would u let a five year old use ur phone or kindle fire ? geez ...	1
If I were n't sterile , I 'm not sure I 'd trust an Android app to keep my girlfriend from getting pregnant ... .get the picture ?	1
This is one of the beter period and ovulation trackers that I have used . My best friend has been using this and she is now pregnant ! ! Very good job !	1
This is another word game that stimulates the brain . It is very fast paced and challenges you to think faster .	1
I really enjoy this game . If you like challenging games , you will like this game . I wish the rounds were a little longer .	1
This app gives you a string of letters and about 30 seconds to make as many words as you can . Then it moves on to another string of letters . I find some sets easy , and others challenging , but I have always been able to think of at least one word for any set . Even with the easy sets , I have to think fast to get a three-letter word , four-letter word , and so on , before it changes sets.It 's great for when I 'm not sure how much time I 'll have to play because I can quit a game any time . This is a must-have app for Wordies . No problems loading on mySamsung Galaxy Tab , it does n't hang up , and there are no intrusive ads .	1
Love it ! I like word games . I hope that wordzup becomes available.I did n't think I would like this one ; it is now one my favorites .	1
I originally picked it out for my grandson , but it is a bit too advanced for him , but I got addicted after trying it out and will play game after game .	1
Great fun and easy to win large amounts if you increase the bet and play more lines ... ... Kids like it too	1
Thanks . I often want to convert something or other . This will keep me from having to Google the answer . It is nice .	1
I love this app it allwos me to organize delete and move all my apps and it does n't delete my sprint nascar app that I really need I do n't know what I would do without my sprint nascar app	1
I like the fact that market prices are essentially up to the minute and the ease at which this app works.Some of the headlines in the News section are somewhat misleading or not clear as to the article you start to read .	1
This is really nice to have so that I can check on stocks & see what is happening in the stock market , anytime during the day .	1
Easy to use lots of news and videos . I am pleased with the free app . It keeps me up to date on the markets	1
Gave it a high rating as it 's free and does more than i thought it would for free . Alot of free app 's are just that free , you open and u ca n't use most of the features cause thay want a fee to do so . This one is simple to use and move around in . Streaming live TV , news vid 's , news articles , my stocks watch list , and alot more . Sometimes with a weaker connection u ca n't load vids or watch live TV . but everything else loads well on weak signals . I recommend this app to all .	1
I 've used this App for many months on my original Droid and again on the Kindle Fire . This is easily one of the best apps I 've found in the Android Market . Perhaps the most useful feature is the ability to view signal strength of all nearby access points on a nice chart listing all of the available channels , making it very easy to see when two or more access points are interfering with each other , and demonstrating which channels would be available for use to reduce such interference in the future .	1
I found several good uses for this application : at home and while traveling.The application has several screens that provide different information . My favorite view is the third screen , the one with the bar display . This is my default view , once you choose this view the next time you start an app it will come up displaying that view.In this view the length of the bar indicates the strength of the signal . The icon on the left shows you whether the channel is open or secured . My tablet is WiFi only , so when I travel it is very handy to quickly see if there are any open WiFi networks and which one of them is the strongest.Another piece of information that is useful is the channel . This is the setting that is useful at home where you can control which channel you are using . If you see that you are sharing the same channel with several other people you can switch which channel your router is using to broadcast WiFi and get a stronger signal . To figure out what is the best option use View # 4 ( details below ) .The other views that I use less often are : The first view is the graph chart that shows you the strength of all WiFi signals.The second view shows you a meter that shows your the strength of your network.The third one ( my favorite ) is described above in detail.The forth one shows the channel in your area with stars indicating the best reception . This view is useful if view 3 shows you that you are sharing the channel with many people and you decide to switch . This screen will help you to choose the best alternative.View 5 shows color coded chart of activity for all local to you WiFi networks . At the top you see a legend for the color-coding . What you want to see that your WiFi line does not cross any other lines , as this would indicate no noise from your neighbor 's networks.This app works well on my Samsung Galaxy 7.7 Tablet running Android HoneyComb . I had no technical problems and the app scales to my screen size very nicely.Ali Julia review	1
use it in most wifi locations to find out who has the most powerful connection - and sometimes the highest unsecured line - great for travel .	1
I believe every Kindle Fire owner should have this application . With it you immediately know how strong a Wi-Fi signal , you are getting . I got it as a free app , so the price was right for me . Super easy to use and it tells you what you want to know .	1
I used this in church for when I volunteer to check the multiple WiFi s , it truthfully is great . It even help me to optimize my own place	1
Especially great for finding that channel when there are multiple routers in the neighborhood - far better than anything else out there and comes with la really nice gui	1
Top notch performance . I have found it very useful for determining signal strength of various wifi hotspots . I use it when providing support for my clients to show them how their repeaters stack up .	1
Lists the WiFi signals and relative strenghts that your kindle can pick up . Handy for determining WiFi hot or cold-spots when setting up WiFi for home or office use . Also helps you select less-used channels in congested signal areas . Simple , intuitive user interface and selection of signal measurement displays .	1
did n't think it would help but it does ... in areas where the wifi is weak ... at least I know its not my kindle with issues	1
Wish I had this App years ago . It is one of the best set up tools I 've seen for WiFi in your home . Easy to use , and very responsive to find the hot and cold spots around your home WiFi Router . It really helps you understand why some wireless devices do n't work so well in certain places . Has to be one of the best Free Apps out there related to WiFi use .	1
This has acurately responded with the wireless signals in our area . Used to find an unknown device in our office with the change in signal strength ; someone had changed the SSID .	1
After changing my router , I wanted an indication of the improvements obtained . analyzer gave a great visual presentation on my tablet that I could watch as I tried various nearby locations .	1
What can I say other than it works like a charm ! Open it up and , if you have the graph selected , you can see all the wireless signals in the area , centered on its channel , and the height of the peak corresponds to signal strength . Walk around the house to see how the signal strength changes . Surprisingly , there were several more signals - about 3X as many than shown on my phone or laptop - picked up by this app . I installed a wireless extender and was able to optimize its location using Wireless Analyzer . There 's a lot more it can do , but this alone has me sold !	1
For site surveys and making sure of channel usage this is one of the most useful tools I have installed on my cheap polaroid tablet .	1
I ca n't really say except that I have had no issues or concerns as yet . I figure if there is something that may help me in even a small way , then it is for me . A little more protection ... .	1
Installed this on my Kindle Fire . Using app found I could increase the strength of my wi-fi by raising my router 3 inches , and see that I could have further improvement by changing broadcast channel from # 1 to # 14 . The program works very well .	1
HI , I RECOMMEND THIS APP . IT HAS A SIGNAL STRENGTH METER ON IT ... ITS GREAT FOR CHECKING THE SIGNAL AS YOU MOVE YOUR ROUTER UP/DOWN OR TO ANOTHER ROOM . I GOT 20 % MORE SIGNAL JUST BY MOVING MY ROUTER A FEW FEET.. ( HOTSPOT ) ... . THIS ALSO FINDS ALL THE LOCAL SIGNALS AND MEASURES EACH ONE . ALSO IT SHOWS THE BUSY BANDWIDTH OF ALL THE CHANNELS ... ( NICE IF YOU LIVE IN THE CITY ) ... ..I WOULD DOWNLOAD IT AGAIN ... ..	1
I wish my iPad had an app like this one . this was the only app on my kindle that I did like using .	1
Great for looking around at Wifi networks , their security levels , channels , strength.Great for walking around your home and determining who 's nearby home is interfering with your network , and on what channel you can best set your router.Great for finding dead zones at work , or anywhere.With the optional Connector Library , you can click on a net and connect.There are many tools like this , surely , but this one 's simplicity and ease of use ( we call that `` usability '' in the biz ) put it ahead of the rest .	1
Easy to use app on my Kindle . It tells me exactly what my house WiFi signal is at any place in my house . Very good app !	1
This little android utility scans for WI-Fi networks and shows you how strong they are and what channel they are using . It suggests the best channel assignment for the WI-Fi network it 's on . That allowed me to reconfigure our network so that it was not being interfered with by our neighbors ' networks .	1
For anyone who is acting as their own IT department , this app is a must . I never thought I would need something like this - then I had a router go wonkie , then my youngest daughter needed Wi-Fi in her room , then I checked into a hotel that had `` free '' Wi-Fi on the easter egg plan ... . Simple and easy to use , even for relative newcomers with lots of useful information in a nice graphical format . Adds are annoying but not obtrusive . A must for your toolbox .	1
very useful DroidX , WiFi analyzer , has made my DroidX pleasant again i seriously have over 340 app 's installed in my phone DroidX greatest phone ever . look me up on [ ... ] or [ ... ]	1
It analyzes the wifi signals as advertised , shows you a graph so you can see which are the strongest signals . No crashes , installed without problems , etc .	1
This is a great tool if you travel about some . And it ok if you need to know what is going on around your home or office . It lets you know if there is a possibility of interferance and what kind of siginal strength you are receiving . The none tech . type users will find it very helpful . The tech.type will find the Spestrum Analyzer very useful and that you have about all you need to set up a Wi-Fi site as far as radio frequency is concerned.Flay	1
It works but would be oh-so better if it was also a spectrum analyzer . But , for free , I 'm not complaining .	1
In my job wifi is more than a buzz-word . I work with it regularly , pretty much a weekly basis , trying to determine if a signal is strong enough or if there are ways to make it better . This app is a must-have for analyzing an environment and trying to find out if you have the right signal strength . I imagine it can be useful to just about anybody who wants to find a good signal . And best of all , this is FREE ! !	1
I 've long hunted for an app that gives me the kind of WiFi signal strength and access point info for my home networks in a format that is easily understood , and WiFi Analyzer takes the cake . Using this app I was able to configure the twelve networks we have here in our college housing apartment complex so they do n't conflict with each other , so they have the best signal strength possible , and much more . Everyone here who uses our WiFi saw a huge improvement , and it was thanks to this app . And it 's free . You really ca n't beat that . Five stars .	1
I find myself using this great little app almost every day . It & apos ; s incredibly useful and the developer keeps it up to date . And it & apos ; s also free ! Totally worth a donation .	1
Perfect tool of WiFi science : ) This taught me a lot about my network that I did n't know before , and has turned my Kindle fire into a tech support tool : )	1
I wanted this app on my iPhone , but Apple killed it . I was happy that I could get it on my Kindle Fire . It really helped me optimize my wifi network .	1
Nicely done . Useful.The interface is clean and easy to use . It could probably use a few more features , but I 'm not sure what . Does everything I wanted it to do , and does it well .	1
This is a great tool if you need to wander around and find what is available and where it 's strong and week .	1
I always wanted to find a way to choose the best channel on my router . This app makes it easy .	1
Performs just as described on my Samsung Charge . Great tool for finding the strongest signal when out and about . Also good as a tool to test placement of my home wifi router .	1
My wi fi has never worked properly , and with this app , I was finally able to SEE the problem ! My neighbor was on the same channel I was . I switched my routed from auto to channel 10 and presto ! ... high speed Nirvana !	1
Great tool to have ! I use this app all the time and it keeps me in the loop . Although all wifi 's are password protected I can see my connection with ease .	1
First of all , at this time it was free . Having said that , I would pay for the app later if they came out with a Pay version . I am very visual and it immediately showed all the WiFi connections in my block . It has several screens that show the information in graphic format and one screen that shows the strength in a full screen `` Vu Meter '' . This helps with the Kindle finding a sweet spot in the house . I am using it on a new Kindle `` Fire '' and it does not appear to have any problems at all . Another real nice feature is that it shows on one of the color screens the channel you , and others are on . This helps as I was able to move to the `` high end '' on my router while most of the others in my area were clustered around the low area . Once again ... very nice , visual , application for use with my new Kindle Fire . Thank you	1
This is a great tool for someone on the go who would like to seek out the best WiFi signal to use one 's tablet or other portable devices . It allows the user to know if he or she is wasting their time trying to find the best Internet connection by mapping network signal strength and displaying it graphically . I find it useful and hope others will too .	1
Use this on a regular basis when looking for a WiFi connection . Works great - use it on 3 devices !	1
It does what it 's designed to do . It does it well and it does it for free . The only reason I ca n't give it 5/5 is that labels tend to overlap one another into an unreadable bundle when there 's multiple routers or channels being displayed . Other than that , it 's most helpful in finding the strongest WiFi signal when I need one . It 's easy and simple to use . That 's elegance .	1
this app is spool good when u do n't no where wifi is just pull it up and it tells u where some is ... .u need to get this app it helps so much ... . : )	1
When you move , your Wi-Fi modem just might be having problems because everyone in your neighborhood is on the same channel . WiFi Modems use channels like Walkie Talkies , and when there are too many on the same channel , your WiFi Devices have a hard time reaching your modem . This little gem will tell you who is on what channel , and what channels are not being used so that you or your internet provider can change the channel to one that is not being used , and you can enjoy delay free streaming !	1
Original level was BROKEN . Since it has been fixed , it is really quite valuable to have when there are multiple APs around and you want to pick the best one .	1
There are always many WIFI signals around me so this helped me to choose the absolute best connection with best internet speeds . Time is money and very costly so you ca n't sit around waiting for your device to connect to the internet . There 's also a variety of graphs to help you visualize.I hope this helps you make an important decision !	1
Great tool for figuring out channels , signal strength , aggregation , overlap , and general site surveys . Hreat for home or professional use .	1
This app allowed me to quickly find dead spots in a friend 's house and to make an informed purchase decision for a repeater . Too many times in the past I would throw money at a problem and hope it went away . Sometimes I got lucky and sometimes I wasted my money . With this for the specific problem of signal drop it was not a matter of luck - the app showed the real problem.Granted the root cause of a signal problem is beyond the scope of this meter , but it 's nice to know whether or not a problem exists with the signal strength or the receiving nodes on a Wi-Fi network . Moreover , this is a wonderful tool for determining the optimal channel to select if you truly want to control multiple networks without conflicts.I loved the different display types that allowed me to select the best view of what was appropriate to measure , and the fact that I could cycle through them with a simple finger swipe as though I were browsing photos . I found the simple meter to be the most useful for surveying signals and the needle reacted to my moving away from the router as well as obstructions like cinderblock walls with no latency.After I set use this to solve a real problem I played around with it in my own home and found some surprising dead spots where I never suspected any existed , plus some decent signal reception where I thought it would drop off to poor quality . Apparently Wi-Fi signals are fickle , but this meter enabled me to accurately map out my own network signal strength throughout my property . It also showed how crowded the frequencies are from other neighboring devices.The important thing , though , is this installed quickly and is not only fast , but reliable . Unlike other apps I have downloaded for free this has a professional feel and is stable . For the record I am using this on a Samsung Galaxy Note II running Android 4.2.1 .	1
This & # 34 ; seemed & # 34 ; to be okay , but it just took up space on my iphone , and I did n't use it that much .	1
A useful tool for finding the quietest channel when setting up a network or picking the strongest signal to leach from .	1
that 's what it feels like ! This app kinda guides you like a schoolmarm to the best wifi spots in your house.In your yard.In your office , restraunt , jail holding cell ( jk ) wherever . And if you 're good and keep the app- later on you will get some nice updates . Ez to read graphics and ez to switch settings for viewing . Very nice job dev dude.or dudette . kudos	1
I was impressed with how far this can sense a signal . This app can pick up signals a half a mile away .	1
Nice to know what your signal strength is . My router is on one end of the house and I normally use my Kindle on the other end of the house and it tells me I am getting a good signal . Have not tried out side with it yet , because it 's to stinking cold out there . And we have a lot of that white stuff . I live in a snow belt area .	1
Seems to do what it claims and what I expected . Obnoxious advertising like most free apps but that was expected too.I was able to confirm that I 'm using the best signal and clearest channel but it will be useful to keep an eye on everybody else and find a better setup for my routers if I need to move away from the crowd .	1
It 's really informative to know what is going on around you that you ca n't see . This lets you peek at the invisible bandwidths you might be sharing or that might be hampering what you need to do .	1
Does what it says ... . Solid utility , graphs and channel strength info . Nothing more to say that has n't . already . been said .. ( : - ) -/ -- (	1
I have a Cruz Velocity T301 and a WiFi link at home . This app is good for keeping track of how strong the signal is at various places within my own home and at other places around town where I can pick up WiFi signals . Now I know how much bad reception I can blame on the signal and how much is inherent in the browser I 'm using .	1
Really opened my eyes to the utility of the 'e-reader ' Kindle Fire and helped me transition to tablet usage . Such a simple thing , but I 've used it at work and at home , troubleshooting issues and tracking things and generally keeping an eye on something I ca n't see with the ol ' Mark 1 eyeball .	1
I installed the app mostly out of curiosity and within minutes uncovered a problem with a router - something I suspected but could n't prove until installing WiFi Analyzer . The app is easy to use understand , it 's stable , and flexible . 5 stars and 2 thumbs up !	1
great app . works extremely well . simple and easy to use . must have for checking wifi . i use it all the time .	1
This app simply displays data ( graphic and text ) about nearby wifi signals . There are a number of similar apps available , but I have found this one to work well and have a pleasing user interface . If it could crack access codes , I would give it six stars .	1
This is a cool little app . I use it to sniff around places while I 'm out and discover any WiFi hotspots I can connect to.It 's also useful to see what channels are in use in your neghborhood ( 2.4GHz or 5GHz ) so you can move your AP to a non-used channel further away from all the others who are running the default channels that came with their wireless box . Everyone in a neighborhood running on channel 11 or 6 or nn is not good . Its also useful to determine the type of encryption being used by the various networks before trying to connect to a network . I also use it to determine which band on my dual-band network gives me the greatest signal strength when I 'm in the far away rooms of my house so I can connect to the strongest .	1
I downloaded this app and imediately put it to use in my own home as well as my daughters ... It not only read my own wifi but others in the neighborhood ... Works better than I expected . I can now tell the best locations in my home to go with my phone or lap top.. GREAT APP	1
AWESOME APPI ! ! ! ! ! HAVE THIS ON BOTH OF MY & # 34 ; WIFI & # 34 ; DEVICES & IS VERY HANDY TO CK . SIGNALS ! ! ! SHOWS MY PHONE WIFI AS HALF OF WHAT MY TABLET RECEIVES ... ..YOU CAN PICK OUT THE BEST WIFI SIGNAL & CONNECT TO IT ! ! ! AND ALL FOR FREE ! ! ! ! FREE IS GOOD ! ! !	1
I have spent endless hours using this tool to look at networks at home , at work and school . Very cool to be able to SHOW someone why their network does n't work very well . Very responsive receiver and graphics and the response rate can be changed in the settings . Like many aps , you have to take the time to explore . Much of what makes it valuble require you to change some of the settings to refine what you are seeing . The only improvement I could suggest is more clarification on looking at 2gHz versus 5gHz signals . But for what it does it is outstanding !	1
This great utility does what it advertises . It 's useful for knowing the best channel to set your access point to and for determining other wireless network strengths .	1
This should be one of the first apps you download . With one quick touch , I can see all Wi-Fi signals in my immediate area complete with signal strength and channel information . No more searching for the strongest signal by trial and error .	1
This is the most useful app I have one the Kindle ! Gives you TOTAL information on the wi-fi you are using as well as everyone else around you . You can see what channels are jammed up and what is free . Just get it , use it and make life easier ! 2 thumbs up on this one !	1
I give this app 4stars because yeah it tells you what Wi-Fi zone your in but it does not do you any good if you do n't know the Wi-Fi password for the place your in .	1
I was having wifi issues with my new computer , my kindle , my laptop . I had Comcast at my home and they found the problem but the technician who came suggested this app . I am glad I took his advise I have found the app to be very useful	1
App works fine . Found all my neighborhood wifis but Wifi Connecter ( the way they spell it ) would not work . After 5 downloads it still failed to install on my Kindle Fire .	1
Pretty Neat & Useful App , if it is really doing what it is indicating it is doing ... Need to test it further to validate it 's readings ' accuracy , but certainly a great concept and it has a nice variety of display alternatives for the signal strength info !	1
The price was right for this little software networking tool . It assisted me with troubleshooting & installing my wireless network.The tool is easy to use & I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to help them set up a wireless network .	1
I got this app so that when traveling , I could find WIFI spots for a GPS program to work on my Kindle Fire HD . As of this time , I have n't had a chance to try it out on a trip , but it does show the strength of the WIFIs close to my home , my own WIFI especially .	1
It 's awesome . I use it anytime I walk into a new place . It helps find a SSID when the homeowner does n't know it .	1
This app does do what is intended of it . It does find all surrounded Wi-Fi connections so you know how strong they are but it is not intended to connect you or hack locked connections . It only tells you the strength .	1
This is a very good tool app to have . I use this when I setup new wifi routers to pick the best channel .	1
App makes it easy to locate Wi-Fi routers and the strength of the router 's signal . Also good for testing the signal of your home router in various room of the house for signal strength .	1
I purchased this app a few weeks ago and it works just fine , I have had no problems at all.It really does n't need to do much except analyze the signal and it does exactly that without fail.I would recommend this to anyone looking to find the strongest signal no matter where you are located .	1
Worth the download . I am able to troubleshoot and diagnose issues with wireless networks using this app . A/B/G/N dosent matter .	1
Wi Fi Analyzer is a must have utility app . If you have a Wi Fi capable phone , it 's the only way to locate hotspots .	1
This is the first wi-fi analyzer I downloaded , but being curious , I downloaded a few more , but this is the best of the bunch . It has the most features and the easiest to understand features . I even paid for one of the other ones that I downloaded because it had pretty pictures , and it was the most worthless . This wi-fi analyzer is now my most useful app . It continues to amaze me how wildly a signal will vary , especially if it is a so-so signal to begin with .	1
this little utility is a great tool to have with you everywhere . If you know a technology you share this with them .	1
Used this App for a while on my old phone . Great tool for crossword puzzles . Easier to0 use on my Kindle than a phone , it 's just larger images	1
This app is perfect for those times when you 're totally stumped on a crossword . You enter the letters you have and question marks for the blanks , and it will give you a list of possible words . Clicking on a word will show the definition . Does n't work for proper names , unfortunately , nor does it work if the answer is multiple words ( e.g . `` peanutbutter '' ) . May return a huge list of words if you have too many blanks.No ads ! Huzzah ! Works great on both the Evo and the Xoom .	1
Handy little app for when you are stumped , and lightning fast . I especially think the anagram helper will come in handy for many types of word games .	1
Loved it ! Very relaxing and easy to pick up ! Looking forward to many hours of destressing on this great app !	1
for .99 its a decent 3-4 star game . giving it 5 stars to balance the rating . the number of levels have to be increased for it to be a fully worthy 5 stars for 99 cents .	1
The game itself is quite fun , but there could be some updates . If the graphics were a little more better and the game would increase speed ( in the case of survival mode ) this game would dramatically improve .	1
device : Kindle FireI find this one distinctly boring ; I suggest taking a long look at the available screenshots to make sure this is a game you might like . It worked very well on my Fire , but I still did n't care for it .	1
This is a pretty fun game ! Some levels are easy until you put the speed at the highest and then it becomes really challenging . Great time killer !	1
its a neat little game . but for free i give it 5 stars . im not greedy . it is a neat fun game . i spent some time on it already . but it is simple colors and ! simple design . but does use some thought for passing each level . since i gave it 5 stars . looking forward to playing it a whole lot more . thanks dev .	1
With so many speed options this is a great game for every one . Nice colors and it really is a challenge at higher speeds .	1
This is a puzzle game that can get pretty hectic pretty quick.It works well on my Kindle Fire and on my Droid 2 . I like the style of the game , and the sound effects are solid . But what I like the most about the game is how hectic it can get . Within a few levels , you are having to move at lightning speed and are trying to juggle a few different colors at once , and it can get pretty difficult.I enjoy playing it , and overall , I think it 's a solid product .	1
Dragon Fire was a fun game and you had better think and react fast . You have to guide the colored dragon fire to the same color vessel or you lose a life . The game starts off slow and gets more and more difficult . It is good that you can slow down the speed of the colored fire to practice a few times before the real tough stuff starts.The game was challenging and fun to play but it does get difficult fast . I am not sure that I will ever finish it . It is a real time consumer . This will not become one of my favorite games as I like other styles but overall it is fun for a while .	1
I 've been playing computer games for almost 40 years . After all that time , it 's refreshing to come across something new . In this game you 're directing colored bursts of dragon 's fire ( that looks remarkably like drops of paint ) through a series of valves you control , to a reservoir of the same color . The trick is figuring out the right combination of valve settings to dispose of each burst.Pro : + In my experience , a new kind of game and relatively fun+ Nice graphics and sound+ Many different levels to play through , similar to advancement through a game like 'angry birds'Con : - I 'm embarassed to say , I have n't quite gotten the hang of it yet , it 's a little hard.This is a high quality game , and as I said earlier , is a new kind of game , at least in my experience . It 's not as groundbreaking as something like Tetris or Myst or Wolfenstein 3D was , but it 's not just another puzzle game either . Definitely worth a shot ! Note : I got this as the free app of the day and played it on my Kindle Fire .	1
this is a cool game where you have to direct these orbs to the right spot really quickly . it seems fun . really challenging .	1
This is a great app to have . This is not an unwind game because you can get hype up and your blood pressure might increase . Fun game	1
This was actually a very good , fun little game ! Judging by the reviews I thought it might suck , but it just goes to show the level of intelligence & amp ; competence on here . ( & amp ; I 'm not talking about superman75 , either . Keep on trolling as far as I 'm concerned ! You 're funny & amp ; entertaining , & amp ; a good break from the moronic ranting that 's usually on here . ) This game is definitely not just a remake of one of the same old crap games circulating on the android market . It 's something new that 's hard enough to make it a challenge , but not so hard that it 's not enjoyable . For a casual game I like it , & amp ; if I cared to play casual games I 'd definitely keep it around.Game play goes something like this : There are several things that look like pots ... some that have colors on them , & amp ; some that have arrows . Each pot has openings on a couple different sides . A dragon breathes colored fire towards one of the pots with an arrow on it . You have to direct the colored fire to the same colored pot by pointing the arrows in the correct direction . It will go in one opening & amp ; out the other to the next pot you 're aimed at . Once the colored fire gets into its colored pot , the pot will close & amp ; is done . The aim is to close them all without getting wrong colors into the wrong pots . Depending on what level you 're on , there can be a lot of arrows & amp ; once you get one color into its pot , it changes color several times before it 's done & amp ; closes . The game progresses quickly , but is n't as hard as it first looks . It does get quite challenging afterwhile , though , which is always good.Overall , definitely a good game for any casual gamer . Anyone with any intelligence wo n't be disappointed !	1
This is an awesome game , and it 's very addictive , but I wish it had more levels . I like to challenge myself by increasing the game speed , but there 's no incentive to doing so in the game .	1
Overall this is an awesome app , I would recommend it to people who like games that require quick thinking and solution solveing . It reminds me of a game I had for my Ipod touch , I think it was called & quot ; Train Gate & quot ; where you changed the gates to get the train into a barn .	1
I enjoy this game very much . I find it relaxing to play and I even enjoy the music . It is one of the few games I play with the sound on . I play every level until I get a perfect score on them all - and then reset the scores and start over . I really do n't understand the bad reviews . Must be a matter of taste . I do n't much care for high stress games but I do n't mind thinking . Play in on Kindle Fire so the SD card thing is not an issue .	1
This game is great at challenging the mind and training your eyes . A good game to waste the day on .	1
I have enjoyed the few levels I played as has my son . I played one of the higher levels and it was challenging fun .	1
Fun puzzle game that kept me entertained for a while . You have to think ahead and be ready to change the direction of the pipe openings .	1
Challenging and addictive . This game will have you on edge by level 5 as you try to keep up with the colors directional placement . Works well on my Kindle fire . 5 stars fun game and it was free .	1
this game is fun yet very simpleit seems like an version of some sort of older game . it seems like something that would be on addicting games and most definatly on cool math . it takes a lot of skill and coordination of with way the fire will have to go . it is a challenge but the time that it takes to do it fills in a space of boredom . highly recommend	1
Without an official App this is by far the Best Flickr App on Android ! ... Its very fast loading , Downloads you entire collection while you are sleeping and Makes showing off you Pics incredibly easy .. On of the best Apps i have purchased	1
this app works great on my EVO 3D , iPad , Galaxy s3 , And Nexus 7 not a single issue ever . I have been using it since the treo days . it keeps getting better and better with every update	1
Desktop sync will work if you uninstall and reinstall with the example records.Would be nice if the tablet version could do exports and imports .	1
I 've used Splash ID since the Palm m505 days . Over the years it 's been very reliable and stable . It does n't offer as much GUI distractions as some of the other password storage programs , so it does look/feel dated . However , when combined with the new desktop manager , I still can not imagine life without it . If you are carrying over an old .VID file , the new one requires a lot of patience to properly import everything . Splash Data 's customer service was helpful to fix some of my mistakes .	1
I have this on my palm pilot and love it so I thought i 'd get it for my kindle hdx . At first it wouldnt work but once I figured out how to get it to work , it magically appeared on my phone too and it syncs with the desktop version no problem . I tried to get the splash key ID too but I couldlnt get that to sync so I was disappointed about that and sent it back . But I 'm glad this is working now with no trouble . I just wish I could get Splash Money to work too ... .	1
I got this app for my smart phones and now use it on my kindle too . easy to use and works perfectly for storing all my private info .	1
On the new kindle fire hd 8.9 this app is even beter than ever . Enable your gps and the ap will do the rest for you . Great for kids . My son checks the moon every day and loves the countdown to the next full moon .	1
I take a lot of photos of the moon and nature . These photos are fantastic . This app also provides a slew of Info . Thank you to the creator ( s ) and Amazon for letting us have this for free .	1
I really enjoyed this app . not only did it tell you the moon phase but it also allows you to view the moon phase a different days	1
I did n't think that I would use it as much as I do but find myself going to it a lot . I hunt and spend a lot of time in the woods so this app helps me plan the times for my trips .	1
This is a neat app for the science-lover . I have n't had a chance to fully explore the app , but like that I can send a picture from the app to a friend . This is a good one for kids .	1
The moon has always fascinated me . This app lets me enjoy the moon even more fully . The only thing I would change is , I wish I could share directly on Facebook . Also , I wish Kindle Fire would let you set your own wallpaper .	1
Will be a great app to use to look at the night or day sky ... Have n't played around with it a whole lot . But still very nice to have ... thanks dev team and amazon !	1
I like this and just overlook imperfections . the stuff will get fixed . I like it and for you crazy people spouting about magic . um fishermen and sailors use the moon all the time and was n't Jesus a fisher of men ? hummmm .	1
The cheese on April 1st was great . I wish there was an option to turn it on and off . Great info , and and I love the rotation of the shadow .	1
I never knew ... what the dark side of the moon looks like - or that the moon rotates like a steering wheel . Without even trying , you can have so much fun and learn a lot about our nearest neighbor . You have to try `` cheese mode '' if your feeling hungry . Once your done with the moon , then you can play with your own galaxy withGravilux .	1
I got this app today ( 1-08-2012 ) and it 's a fun app . I 'll have to wait and see how it works in the long run , but so far it works great on Mt Kindle Fire .	1
This is wotth buying if you love anything to do with heavenly bodies..Yhe one over our little planet especially..I give him a 9 .5 on this application .. Always room for improvement .	1
Seems like I can never find a calendar these days with the moons full and new cycles on it . As a woman , find it great for keeping track of schedules - you other ladies know what I mean . Easy to use , graphics are nice and I bought ( with money ) paid version on my Android phone . Like to know when all the crazy people are going to be out too .	1
I love this app . its great and the veiw is awesome . what a great way to look at the moon so close ! I love it !	1
The level of detail is great , maybe a little too much sometimes , the flexibility of presenting the data is excellent and being able to know the moon status at anytime of any day or time is incredible . I am happy with this app .	1
Originally had trouble with the program hanging up . After my review the company contacted me and I reinstalled the app and everything works great . Very good response from the company and I now enjoy the app as I expected .	1
I like taking pictures of the sky , and sometimes even the moon . This is a great app for timing the right nights to do it ( the moon is best taken a picture of when it is n't full ) , and the sky when it is a new moon . It is easy to use and informative . Highly recommended for astronomers .	1
This app is an interesting calendar tool and astronomical guide to lunar activity . On the main screen it shows you what the moon will be like today . You have to enter in your location to get accurate information . What I like is that by touching the calendar symbol at the top you get a monthly calendar and it shows the lunar status for every day of the upcoming month . You can even look months ahead . If you touch a day the lower of the screen provides a larger view of the moon on the day you selected.By touching the data button you can review all of the lunar activity for that day with all of the scientific data provided to you . The place button wants you to enter you location to provide you accurate lunar data . You also have a clock function in order to advance the data or time to see the changes in the view of the moon.I gave this app 5 stars for the quality of the data provided and its uniqueness . It is interesting !	1
Great app . I enjoy checking the moon phase and even though it says the pictures are a simulation they are cool as well . Easy to use and fun . This is really cool .	1
I like the app , its useful information and its pop ups as the alert me to the moon phases . Thanks	1
I never would have thought someone would make an app just to track the phase of the moon , and when it rises and sets . And , if they did , I never would have dreamed they would make such a *beautiful* app . You enter your location , and it renders the current phase of the moon for where you are , and indicates when it rises and sets . It even rotates the image of the moon to compensate for your location : wicked ! Pro : + Simple , elegant user interface : moon set / rise for any day , and the portion of the moon 'full ' , as well as the ability to drag the shadow and be told what day / time it will look like that.+ The picture of the moon and the shadow are amazingly well done . I stared at it for a while just to enjoy it.+ I could see this being useful for those who have to care about the phase of the moon , e.g . those following a lunar calendar.Con : - None . Beautiful app ! I am using this on my Kindle Fire and got it for free . I may refer back to it to see when the moon is full and when it will be visible on the days it is : Seeing the full moon as it 's rising at night is romantic , at least to me : )	1
I was pleasantly surprised with the information provided . After downloading I wanted to look at the moon but clouds are in the way . Bummer !	1
I would recommend this app . It can be nice to look up the phases of the moon , past present and future .	1
So many moon apps for Apple devices require a GPS to set location . It 's great to see that this app simply lets you enter a city name -- and it auto competes lat . & amp ; long. -- or you can enter your precise coordinates . Kindle Fire for the win !	1
Excellent app designed well ..does what it 's sopose to.even sends notificationsThis helps me identify when the moon affects my husbands mood swings . I 've tracked it and it does affect people .	1
To address the one oft mentioned issue . The developer is now aware that it shows waning gibbous for today ( 1/8/12 ) and it only seems to affect today . He is working on a fix for it . If you 're guess that means you get a quick reply from the Dev , you 'd be absolutely correct.The app works beautifully on my Droid 2 Global and I had no issues with it freezing . However , I did use the back button to exit out and not the home button . Overall , between quick developer response and the very slick , nicely done app , ca n't help but give this little darling a 5 star . If you like having the phases of the moon at your fingertips , this is the app for you and with it being FAOTD ? You ca n't lose . ; )	1
Moon Phase ProWhat 's not to like ? This is a well-written , tasty little app . While marveling at the moon , I 'm also amazed by the high-quality , FREE apps that the Android platform continues to spawn .	1
A neat informative app . I like it and have enjoyed looking at it from time to time . Could be useful for teaching kids .	1
I this is a great calendar app . I wanted a unique calendar app and this is it . Love the moon phases for every day of the month .	1
I grow weary of games , even if they are great games . This is a great pick , Amazon.com ( not that I 'm saying every single selection you 've made lately is a good one ) .	1
Download it for yourself ! If you listen to these & quot ; Dumb-Donkeys & quot ; then your gon na miss out is all I can say ! ( THOUGHT YOU HAD TO BE OVER 13 TO COMMENT ) Even if you do n't use it it will always be in your cloud ! ! Quit contiplating and DOWNLOAD the damn app ! !	1
I have absolutely no use for this app ... and I love it . The pictures of the moon are beautiful . And for those with a sense of humor , it has Cheese Mode which is cute . You can open it up and know the phase of the moon , what it looks like from your location , when the last full moon was , moon rise and set time , etc.Again , I have no use for this , but I like having it . : - )	1
Not that I 'm complaining , I 'm here now , but it seems like it would be a bit better to call it `` Luna Phase Pro '' . Seriously , just try and see where Ganymede , IO or for that matter the forest moon of Endor are.I mean , if I were a Galadorian attempting to track the progression of the Dire Wraiths in the Dark Nebula , I 'd be screwed.But , eh , pretty neat I guess ...	1
I love this app ! I 'm using cheese mode as background on my Evo 4G . LOL Looks and works great . So glad I have it so I always know the moon phase ! I no longer have to ask & quot ; is it a full moon ? & quot ; When I notice peeps are being crazy ! LOL	1
This is the BEST way to follow the moon phases accurately ... .Nice , crisp , clear info , and best of all , it was free ! Thank You !	1
Moon Phase Pro does an excellent job at displaying moon shapes and accurately displaying its next occurrence . It can even remind you when certain shapes of the moon are in the sky ! Very clean interface and easy to use .	1
Love this app comes in really handy ... Very accurate has never been wrong . Great for all farmers & gardeners . Hope this is helpful to everyone .	1
Love this app , I 'm a avid moon watcher and this is one of the most comprehensive apps out there for moon watchers . I highly recommend this app for the sky watchers .	1
Works good on Galaxy SII phone and Galaxy Note 10.1 , in my opinion- there 's no other moon phase program that can touch this . Got it on the faotd , but worth the money if I was looking for a solution to monitoring moon phases for say ... fishing excursions ! Nice live desktop wallpaper too . I 'll seasonally change my wallpaper , but always come back to this one .	1
This is a very neat app and works perfectly on my EVO 3D . I could see myself paying 99cent for this app for sure . Allie Eledge is a suckish idiot ...	1
If you want to have an app that will teach you all about the moon and its many phases then this is the app for you ! At any given time I can know exactly how the moon will look on what day . It also will give you a view of the moon on a monthly calendar . I have this app on my phone and also my Kindle Fire HD . Definitely worth it !	1
I was excited when I saw the app and to make it better , it was free ! I Really enjoy it : )	1
I opened this up because it was free and I scrolled through the calender and then to the right I saw another option and my mind went*pop* there is sunset moonrise and all other kinds of things on here that are n't just related to the moon but the rotation of night and day too	1
Great app for someone who wants to learn about the moon phases . You can move the shadow of the moon to see when the full moon or new moon will happen . It is a great app to teach kids about something educational in life .	1
Very addicting . Once you start you do n't want to stop because you want to see how many levels you can pass . Definitely worth downloading .	1
If you do n't like to lose , do n't play this game ; however , if you like a good challenge , by all means , this is a fun game . I 've played other versions of Pyramid but this one is harder to win . I like the challenge and feel good when I do win . I have had no problems with the game on my Kindle Fire .	1
Pyramid is my new favorite solitaire platform . This version is a great one for teaching grandkids to count to 13 and to assemble groups .	1
Starting easy , this puzzler has you match two orbs in a line to eliminate them from the field . Eliminating all orbs from the field completes the level . Later levels have you matching 3-4 orbs and stars ( count as 2 orbs ) to clear them . The graphics are good and the sound is decent . Oddly enough , the story is what kept me playing through all 100 levels . The lack of an ending to that story is the only reason I dock this game a star .	1
This game is a fun puzzle game . Looks pretty good too . This devs games always look cool . 5 stars from me since the music was also good .	1
As a fan of Hexage games , I was pleasantly surprised to see a puzzle game by the company available on the Kindle Fire HD . Hexage is known for stunning visuals and innovative game-play twists on strategy genres , and they do not disappoint on this title . I also feel that this game has not received enough credit on its Amazon port , as very few people know about it . In an attempt to give an accurate and easy to view review , here are the pros and cons of the puzzle game `` Totemo HD '' : Pros -*Great Visuals - The graphics in `` Totemo HD '' are what puts this puzzle game over the top for me . On the Kindle Fire HD , the visuals are breathtaking due to its usage of the High Definition version . The background visuals , the menu screens , and the spirits themselves bring an eerie feeling to this puzzle game . I would say that these visuals bring a feel reminiscent of the zen puzzle game `` Quell '' . Your `` guide '' and narrator of the game ( the totem man ; traveling between worlds ) is very vibrant and again adds to the ghastly feel of the game . *Easy Controls ; Difficult Game - `` Totemo HD '' paces the game well as you begin to play it by matching the `` spirits '' in pairs of various numbers ( 2 , 3 , ect . ) in vertical or horizontal lines . It may seem simple , but the addition of other barricades such as star spirits add to the complexity . Some levels are insanely hard and challenging , which I feel is much better than hundreds of easy levels . The 100 levels in this game will keep you going for a while , and the challenge makes it worthwhile in comparison to some puzzle games that are just too easy for a majority of the time . *Great Accompaniment Soundtrack - The Kindle Fire HD 's Dolby Digital Plus sound system seems to make great use of Hexage 's soundtrack in their games , and the eerie sounds of `` Totemo HD '' add to the general feel of the game . With the visuals and music , it creates a wonderfully surreal puzzle playing atmosphere . *Survival Mode - On top of the 100 levels of puzzles , a survival mode pressures you to complete endless amounts of puzzles quickly to keep going , and an online leader board makes this even more enjoyable.Cons -*HD Only ( ? ) - As I have a Kindle Fire HD , I have no problem with paying $ 1.99 to get a stunning HD puzzle game , but I think this may be a negative aspect for regular Kindle Fire users as `` Totemo HD '' is the only version of the game in the Amazon App store . Regular Kindle Fire users will not be able to use the HD aspect of this game , sadly , and I would suggest if possible , Hexage , to put a regular port of the game on the marketplace . *Possibly Short - `` Totemo HD '' currently has 100 levels . I have heard that it previously had only 62 , and I am glad that Hexage expounded on the number of levels . To many , this seems to be too few levels , but the difficulty of them ( starting VERY early on ) makes it longer than one may expect . Even so , I ca n't imagine this game taking too long for people to beat , but I would recommend playing survival mode or the story again . *No hints - There is no hint system or `` pay-to-proceed '' system using either real money or in game currency ( as there is no in game currency ) . This may turn some people off , since the levels are difficult . For me , this was n't a problem.Conclusion - '' Totemo HD '' is a puzzle game that is hard to pass up . It 's challenging , beautiful , and the soundtrack is great for doing these puzzles . I highly recommend this game , and I feel it has gotten far to little recognition on the Amazon Appstore . Check this game out , even if you are only a casual puzzle gamer .	1
This is a fun logic game that I installed on a whim to keep my daughters ( 12 and 7 ) entertained . It 's engaging enough that it keeps them occupied , but not something that they want to play all the time . No problems on my Samsung G4 .	1
I play this with my 5 year old daughter . Sometimes we take turns on each screen , or we help each other work the screen out . To play , you have to join the objects , with none being left over by the end , and if you get it wrong , you just shake the kindle and the level replays . The only issue I have is that as the level changes , it 's not always intuitive what you should do , so there 's trial and error involved , but even that is pretty fun . We both really enjoy this game .	1
This is a pattern game . You 're supposed to figure out the pattern code to pass each level.It 's not a difficult game to learn . My daughter enjoyed it more than I did .	1
You can spend lots of time playing this since it can be quite addictive . No complaints about the game play or how it works on any of my devices .	1
Great App ! Does what it is supposed to ! Works very well on my Samsung Galaxy IIThanks Amazon for & # 34 ; Free App Everyday ! ! !	1
Uber fun . Me and my children love it ( ages 5 & 7 ) . It is addicting . It is also frustrating because when you are stuck there is no way of getting hints on how to solve the level .	1
this is different than a lot of games out there , there are some twists on the idea of matching ( there are both 3 and 2 matches to do ) but instead of the time forced approach of most match games , this one takes thinking and planning . You will get stuck on some of the more complicated puzzles but that 's the point .	1
This game is very enjoyable and addictive . I ca n't seem to put it down . You have to eliminate rows of demons , but you have to complete it in the right order or all the demons will not disappear . You have to think about your moves before you begin to eliminate . I love this game , it gives your brain a workout .	1
Very nice looking graphics and addictive game play . The difficulty progresses perfectly at first so you can get the hang of it while providing a good challenge in the higher levels . I highly recommend it , especially while it 's free , although it 's definitely worth the regular price .	1
This app is pretty boss app it is the best app ever totally worth two dollars you should get this appThank you , nicholas parker	1
Good graphics & sound , very enjoyable , fun & challenging puzzle game with a different twist . Got it FREE , but would recomend it even if you have to pay .	1
This game is a hoot ! Lots of dialog from Totemo to keep you interested and the graphics are so cool !	1
This game is deceptively simple . It starts off easy but then quickly becomes much more challenging . I 've played to level 20 and am starting to feel a little frustrated . The trouble is , there are n't many incentives for solving each level ... .just more difficulty . Graphics are decent and the game functions smoothly but the story just is n't that interesting or visually appealing .	1
Well lets start with this interesting little android app being quite cute but seems to force close alot killing the experience .	1
Yes , just wow . I could not believe that something like this existed . This is a nice puzzle game like none other ! As for levels that stump you , you can go to a different puzzle and solve the other one later .	1
Although you 'll need to connect two and three & quot ; like colored spirits & quot ; together in order to clear the puzzle board , the game play is no way near the same as games such as ; Bejewled or Atlantis . Totemo HD , when playing in Strategy Mode , requires much thought as to exactly how you are going to clear the board . By level 10 , that becomes slightly difficult . I am currently on level 25 and it has become increasingly , much more difficult , to the point I 've had to restart level 25 seven times and still have n't f found the solution ... .yet . ; - ) The graphics and sound track are awesome . I like the Spirit guide but for me , as I got further into the game and found myself needing to restart levels over & amp ; over again , trying to find a solution , I 'd get frustrated and that Guide would become less cute each time . LOL There are Options for the music , as well as the sounds in the Menu if you 'd prefer to turn them down or , off for better concentration.Any questionable permissions are due to having the option to post your scores to online leader boards , however , I do not see any other excessive permissions for this app that should warrant concern.So , if you enjoy a good strategy puzzle-type game , then I strongly recommend checking this one out as today 's FAOTD . It 's also worth the asking price for those you that have missed out on the FAOTD	1
I did n't & # 34 ; get it & # 34 ; until I got stuck at the 11th puzzle for a bit , then it hit me . The brilliance in this is not in endlessly matching 2 , 3 or more rows of identical items , it 's the pattern in which you unlock them that is the key to wiping out the entire level . The little floating guide persona is cute at first but gets kinda boring after a while . There may be too much backstory wedged into what is in essence an easy to learn but harder to master puzzle.Besides being a thoughtful time waster , the graphics and animations are all buttery smooth and game play is perfectly responsive . A great effort !	1
My husband used this app when my soon was born and it was great ! Being able to sync the day 's goings on with the baby is so helpful , especially if you have one working parent and one stay at home parent or care giver or a child on medication daily that needs to be tracked . I would love to see this app used in a childcare facility . Being able to instantly see what 's logged is great to keep everyone feeling like they 're involved in baby 's day even when they 're at work . Granted I have n't used it in months , but the Dev was responsive and even considers user recommendations ! Must have for new parents !	1
We love this app . reliable on our droid and droid incredible . has helped us stay sane with new baby . strongly recommend .	1
This app is a LIFE SAVER ! ! ! I have a son with athsma and I have easily been able to track his treatments with this app . We used it for keeping track of his bottle feedings , medicne schedual ( with personalized reminders ) , and I even made my own slot foor solid food feedings too ! If your on the fence about purchasing , please take it from me , YOU WILL LOVE THIS APP ! ! ! !	1
PHENOMENAL app and INCREDIBLE support ! ! I use this app at least a dozen times every day . I do n't know what I 'd do without it .	1
this app would be great if it grew with your baby . to do that they need to add a food tracker along with the bottle tracker . my son outgrew this app in a few months . please add a way to keep track of food also then I could use this for a lot longer .	1
I would have rated this 5 stars if I was able to change the appearance of the face of the card . I do n't like the way the numbers , symbols and letters look . It is different than the one I have on my phone and I can change it on my phone , but it 's the same game . I would like it to look the same . It does n't have the & # 34 ; standard & # 34 ; look , it is very large and I like to whip through the game and it is hard to scan it quickly if your eyes are n't used to it . But I still love this version of the game and I am super glad I got it . It works great on my phone and kindle fire , so problems .	1
Does a great job with the solitaire game . Graphics are good and gameplay is interesting . I really enjoy playing this on my tablet .	1
It does exactly what the description says . It is very small and useful . You just have to find a right place for installing it so it is not as visible as it could be . Fast service and great company to deal with .	1
Fun and enlightening . Look through the prism of the Tao child and see the relevance . Give it a try with Grandma ... you 'll get a smile .	1
a fun little app i got for free and works fin on my new phone . it works and i have another app to play with .	1
Zombie face looks cool as hell the only problem is thwt it does n't detect faces if you choose to take picture within the app . just take a pic with your regular camera App and load the picture and it works fine . and for people who say the face comes out looking retarded , this is a zombie making app not a miracle worker ... if your ugly as hell its not the apps fault go blame your momma and give this app the five stars it deserves	1
it didnt work everytime , but the times it does work it does a great job and does it pretty quickly too ! within a minute i was able to see myself as a zombie ! looked silly and a little unreal , but hey , whatda except ? ! Htc G2 for tmobile	1
I ca n't believe how many people gave this app a bad rating ! I have had so much fun with this app lately . All of my co-workers have begged me to & quot ; zombify & quot ; them . The results are pretty amazing for the most part . It seems to work best on women . It could be improved with better instructions and a better facial recognition algorithm . Lastly , dev , please allow to change the sex of the zombies voice . Overall , this app is awesome .	1
not sure why everyone else is saying that it does n't recognize faces , I 've used it ten times so far and has nailed every one . Droid Incredible .	1
Decent works good on Evo 4g . Just wish it looked more like the app picture instead of an unbelievable animation . Worth a try . a s	1
The `` ZombieBooth '' app allows you to zombify anyone in a picture , usually with good results . Full face images without cluttered backgrounds are best . The zombie on the screen will react to touching the screen by attempting to bite the finger and static images can be exported and saved.Tried this on a statue in church and , surprisingly , it worked but I got in trouble with my wife so will not be doing that again anytime soon . Still might be fun at a museum ... This installed and ran perfectly on my HTC EVO running Android v2.3.3Recommended ! CFH	1
I do n't know why so many people are having troubles with the app , it works great , better then I expected . Plus amazon tests apps before allowing then on the market .	1
my kids and i have had a blast changing our faces into zombies . we especially like how the zombie bites you . no force close problems at all .	1
My kids and I have had a lot of fun with this app . We found that if you use a photo with 2 people one will be a zombie , so you can make some funny scenes that way.Anyone who complains about how `` simple '' this app is , does n't know alot about what it takes to make an app like this .	1
Extremely creepy . Had no issues recognizing my photos . Takes a while to process but the results are worth it . HTC Thunderbolt .	1
Cool app , works very well . Can be kinda slow to run , but that is probably sure to the nature of the app with its facial recognition software . Not bad for free !	1
This is a very fun app for a while . it does need some improvement on the face recognition . can be impossible to get a face into it , but once they are in let the fun begin ! My kids love watching the zombies ! Thumbs up to the developer . And for every one wanting the apps to be better on android , if the developers make better money from android , the apps will be the better of all the os .	1
definately good app . works as described . take pix closeup and it will do rest . real nifty . am expecting developer to contiually improve this app . fun to use at events or happy hour and also kids loves this ap	1
( read app 'directions ' ) If you have glasses on or not facing camera correctly you might have problems . I found no problems with this app , even worked with low light pic . Animation is great , and shaking phone for more zombie looks a cool.Works Great !	1
I have had no problems with it so far . Pretty nice app for free ! ! ! Had no problems getting twitter working with it .	1
I love the fact that I can update my fb at the same time . its a great way to save time	1
I 've only used the app for 4 days but it is quite easy to use with both twitter and facebook . For the latter there are issues with posting comments that need fixing .	1
Twitter works perfectly for me on my Kindle Fire , however I ca n't get Facebook to work , just stays stuck saying loading after I authorize the app in facebook .	1
I 've used pretty much every social networking app available and Seesmic is by far the most streamlined of all of them . I highly recommend it . Especially on the Kindle Fire .	1
I mainly use this app for Twitter on my Kindle Fire . Found 1 down side . Takes awhile to load missing tweets .	1
I think this is a great app . sucks that twitter does n't have one that works for kindle fire . cant beat free , and no ads	1
I like this app better than the facenook app that comes standard on the Fire . My only gripe is that I ca n't view photo albums on it .	1
It 's ok since I found I could make Twitter come up by default instead of Facebook.I 'd like to see more buttons up top instead of having to use the menu button . ( I always hit 'reply ' when I want to retweet . )	1
this app is by far the beet Multics social network app I have used on the amazon kindle fire . No problems with posting from twitter to facebook and vice versa . The only flaw may be the tiny photo images on the news feed . Other than that , I have no complaints .	1
Seesmic is just what i 've been looking for , simple yet has everything i need . I wish they supported LinkedIn too ! Works well for quickly scanning all your social networks for things of interest .	1
The transition from the desktop version to the phone/tablet space is very smooth . Does an excellent job of keeping up with all my Twitter feeds as well as my Facebook and Flickr accounts . Wish it did better with Facebook notifications , though .	1
this is the best socializing app ive used . it actually shows the pictures and videos through the app from facebook . it is one of the only app I know that can actually view the posts and not just post the on facebook . kudos to the creator and development team : )	1
This app does what I got it to do , which was to handle the feeds to and from my facebook account . I can post my status updates easily , message friends , search , and read updates and view pics . In other words , it does the basics well . I also like that several posts that I was not seeing with Facebook 's app were suddenly appearing.However , I noticed that one of my regular friends suddenly was not available through Seesmic ( I checked the website , and she had n't unfriended me ! ) . The other thing that I ca n't find is how to check in from a location ) . For me , if those two issues were fixed , the app would get a 5 .	1
I really liked the look & amp ; feel of this app and , after trying so many other Twitter apps , I thought I had finally found the one for me . That 's when I realized there was no Mute feature . This alone killed it for me . If they added this , I would use it - hands down !	1
Great for Twitter and Facebook . I prefer hootsuite but Seesmic does things other twitter clients do not such as edit your bio and photo ; so I keep it around when I need it .	1
I 've been playing Military Madness/Nectaris since it was new on the Turbo Graphix 16 here in the U.S . This version was very playable with a single finger interface.PROS : I ca n't think of any of the Turbo Graphix 16 original vehicles that did n't make it , they all seem to be here.Control scheme works well.Entertaining.Game mechanics still hold up well.Cheap ! Cons : The AI is weak . I blew through this game quicker than I should have.If you 're used to hitting the `` back '' button on your Android Phone to back off of controlling a unit it could back-fire since that exits the game without saving . ( takes some getting used to ) No network / multi-player.I recently noticed there were `` bonus '' levels after beating the `` final '' level by selecting the chose map screen and clicking on the level that appears without the progress road attached . The final levels , 19 & 20 , are actually rather challenging .	1
If all you want to do is create some basic flashcards right on your Kindle Fire without too much fuss , this is a nice app.It is very easy to categorize ( and even sub categorize ) your card sets , so if you have a bunch of topics , you can keep them well-organized . You can add/edit single cards in your existing sets fairly easily too , but ... Deleting might become a chore if you 've got a lots of cards in one set - currently , as far as I can tell , you can only delete ALL of your existing decks , the current card you 're on , or you can `` go to '' a card number - It would be much nicer if you could scroll through a list of your cards by content ( instead of the `` go to '' ) , and/or if you could delete a specific selected deck.There is a decent selection of fonts and font sizes available . Background can be switched from lined to plain paper - though it would be good if you could change the background color to something other than white ... When you run through a stack of cards , the app uses a `` pass/no pass system '' i.e. , you can flag the ones you are having trouble with , and then just review those specific cards when you are finished . You can also shuffle the cards.Well worth a buck for my purposes .	1
I really enjoy playing this game as it makes you need to use your brain to figure out the plays .	1
I love this app because the Cards are so large and there are also no ads popping up between hands ! Nice clean playing field , good instructions , great app !	1
great playing game..sometimes easy , but even when it appears hard to win..the reverse move feature comes in handy..nice to have a stats feature	1
I love the game and especially that every game can be won by trying again ( and again ! ) Lot 's of fun ...	1
It keeps you thinking with a variety of dealings . It is easy to undo and try again at a solution .	1
I love playing FreeCell so this is a great game for me.Once you have tried it , you will have a hard time putting it down .	1
This game is one of my favorite card games.I really enjoy this version . I know this sounds weird but wheni go deer hunting i take my game withe me . It helps to pass the timeand to keep you from falling asleep.Thanks	1
I love card games and this one is a challenge - harder than plain solitaire . I recommend Free Cell to anyone who loves card games .	1
We play the game and cant stop playing it till the battery stops working then we play with it plug in	1
Amazon Prime and free apps for the Kindle Fire . What else could you want . These apps download fast directly from the Kindle Fire !	1
Nice and snappy . Not much lag . This is a fun and addicting game of challenge . You will enjoy . very easy to set up on your kindle	1
Fun game for all ages.Simple ASCII graphics . Scroll finger anywhere on the screen to move your robot.Some direction touch buttons would make the game less laborious . : - )	1
If you liked HandyShopper on the Palm , this is the one . You can even convert data from HS and import it into this app . Excellent .	1
This is a wonderful word game . I play it every day and enjoy scrambling words . It is a mind teaser . Try it .	1
I remember playing the free version of this a long time ago . I wound up uninstalling it because I hate ads and I would n't pay more than 99c for it.It 's scrabble solitaire . It 's very good at being exactly what you expect it to be . The UI could use a facelift , and is a bit cluttered.Glad I got it for free , it will stay on my phone . Especially since the dev gets it ... even weighing in at under 800KB it still moves to the SD card . My OCD thanks you .	1
I like the game , but could you make the back button actually go back to the menu and not exit the app ? It 's just sort of annoying that way . No other complaints really , just that little thing .	1
Works well , and plays smoothly . I 'd love to use it on my tablet , but the tablet is too wide . Still , it 's an addictive way to spend time when you 're between appointments or classes .	1
runs faster than the free version , but could use a bigger dictionary . does not teach the English language very well .	1
I love this game for a quick mind work out . The program does n't spend forever loading on my phone and when a game is over there is n't a lot to click through to start a new game . I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a quick game of text twist or boggle in their free time !	1
I 'm not into word games especially , but I really like this . It looks great on my Acer tablet and is surprisingly addictive . Read the Help file before jumping in to the game - there 's not a tutorial .	1
Fun , challenging but not so long you get bored with it . I would love to see a sequel or three !	1
I 'm having a good time with this game . It does force close occasionally as some people are reporting . But it works fine most of the time on my Incredible . Very reminiscent of old time point and click pc games but with really nice looking graphics and fun though repetitive music .	1
I remember when a game like this would have taken up half your hard drive and cost you over $ 20.00 . Heck , I remember no computer at all and watching the original 13 Ghosts ! At $ .99 . it 's a real bargain . Like all good games , it leaves you wanting more . Parts were more challenging for me because of my limited manual dexterity , but that 's not the programmer 's fault . I like the game a lot and hope for other , similar products .	1
Overall , this played very well on my Toshiba Thrive and had excellent graphics and game play . The only downside is it really is pretty short and lacks a huge story line . I hope to see more like this .	1
The game was simple to play . Easy to move around in , and was entertaining for both adults and young adults .	1
This game is well put together , but feels short if you are good at these types of games and figure it out too easily . the only way I could suggest making it better is simply making it longer with more involved puzzles and a higher difficulty .	1
This is a terrific game app . I have a Thunderbolt -- no problems with running the app at all . Beautiful graphics , smart puzzling , intersting and fun . I could n't wait to get to the end . Keep up the great work Fire Maple Games !	1
Well made game . Quite short . Abrupt ending . Tricky but not impossible . Worth a download . Got for free , but would buy other games from developer . worth $ 1 .	1
We need more games like this . This type of game lends itself nicely to a cell phone . Ca n't wait for the next one .	1
I usually do n't like this type of game but I am enjoying it . Great graphics and is n't impossible to play through . Sure it is short but how many rooms do you want to keep track of ? We are playing on a mobile phone when we have a minute or two . Instead of a longer single game like some are saying I would recommend levels to progress to . Droid 1st generation .	1
Wish it would have been longer ! But it 's a fun little mystery game and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good point and click adventure	1
The art is impressive . The puzzles are clever and fair.I only wish the game were longer . If you 've played exploration-based puzzle games before , you will probably beat this in a short time .	1
Can actually solve the puzzles on this game without a strategy guide . Good graphics . Challenging puzzles that relate to the store line for the final solution .	1
I got to the end and spun the 3 dials till they all glowed blue and then that was it . Nothing happened . I checked on line and this is where you find the grandpa . What gives ?	1
This brought back some good memories of playing myst . While it did take me about 45 mins to complete , it was definitely worth the play . Oh ya ... Its FREE ! The reason its got such low ratings is probably because those idiots do n't know how to solve basic puzzles . Download it !	1
this game is realy cool its a little hard at times but still very fun the game has great graphics this game can be very frustrating but still my faverite mystery game works great on the kindle fire.COOL GAME ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
Droid X , no issues whatsoever . Very fun and addictive . It 's not quite HOG , more so puzzle adventure . Definitely a good pick up . Not done yet so no comment on length .	1
great game for me . It is short , but compared to other similar games , I think that .99 & cent ; is fair and .49 & cent ; is a bargain . I have been pleased with all Fire Maple Games that I have tried so far .	1
Completed in one afternoon but lots of fun for short little puzzle game . Had some issues force closing when I tried to open it from app menu ( Droid X ) but when I opened it from Amazon 's App Store app there were no problems . That was fun , bring some more ! !	1
I thoroughly enjoyed this game . But it was n't long enough . It needs more puzzles , maybe a side-quest or two , and more items to interact with . The only drawback it had was no SD card support . I had to uninstall it because I was running low on space .	1
Things went quickly for a while and then I was stumped for a bit , which makes this game fun and interesting . This continued several times , I had to really stop and think to get to the end . A great brain exercise . You wo n't be sorry if you play this one ... ..Enjoy !	1
I think the author did a fabulous job ! Graphics are great , clues are just tough enough to be challenging yet not frustrating . Ca n't wait for his next project ! Good job , thanks . Droid X 2.2	1
Game Play is a lot of fun . I wish it was longer or had an expansion chapter . Game is not too hard where you need to cheat . My 10 year daughter and I played it together and had a blast . Worth the buck .	1
I give it 4 stars only because it was so short . The time I spent playing was great entertainment and very challenging .	1
Had a good time playing , got stuck halfway , but used walk through twice and kept going . Not too difficult , makes you think .	1
my daughter and myself could n't put it down..so much fun..got stuck once but was able to get help on line..would love more like this .	1
This game brought back memories of playing Myst way back in the day . It 's very similar adventure game , and keeps you frustrated/ interested to figure out and solve the puzzles in the game.It is only `` very short '' if you know what to do without exploring . Decently long , but not quite as long as a similar full PC game.Some things that I felt were not well designed ( but may have fit in with the vision of `` just click everything ! '' -*There is a corridor on the second floor between the other doors- you have to click in the middle of the wall , and find there is another door . *They used four birds , and four colors on the globe , but needing to be arranged in a direction , corresponding to the drawing on the second floor . Confusing since the colors on the globe seem to have the same directions of the drawing , and not the `` statues '' * in the main hallway both the floor and the `` paper '' on the painting are n't visibly `` interactive '' .Overall a fun game , and most of the puzzles are fun to figure out . Graphics are great , the only real complaints are the issues with the game design , and possibly wanting more to the story - but it is after all a puzzle game , and not needing a `` cool story '' .	1
I absoloutly LOVE this app ! ! ! ! ! If you 're reading this then STOP right now and download this app ! ! ! You wo n't regret it ! ! ! !	1
The only bad part of this review is that there are only two graphic adventure games from Maple Fire . Please bring on more like this one . Great game . Lots of puzzles to check out and interesting roaming about the house . The graphics are very nice too . I thought the end was a bit lack luster , but over great .	1
pretty good game , glad I got it for free though . took some good developing skills though probably.. fun game , but now that I beat it , not much replay value . first time through only 25 mins .	1
I always liked this type of adventure game played on a PC . This is the first similar game I 've tried on an Android device ( Droid 2 ) . Considering the screen size and memory limitations the developer has to work with , I consider this very well done . If you do n't enjoy this type of puzzle/hunt adventure game , this is n't for you ... but if you do like this type of game , give it a try ... you will be pleased.People who are so critical of these apps , consider what you 're getting for free or a dollar or two ... what do you expect ? These apps are bargains for the entertainment they provide .	1
A well polished adventure with just the right difficulty for playing with kids . But do n't plan on more than an hour or two of play . If they develop another , I will buy , but I hope it is longer .	1
This was a very fun game . Short but challenging . I enjoyed it so much I downloaded the next edition in this series . Graphics are incredible .	1
Secret of Grisly Manor and the Lost City are magnificent games.Their creativity is rivaled only by the difficulty . It is a true mystery solving experience . This and the Lost City are by far the best games I have played . Fire Maple Games , I beg you , make more like this ! I have been sorely dissapointed in my search for similar games and would greatly appreciate it .	1
like others said , it does n't take long to play . took me a little over an hour . but it had several fun puzzles and nice graphics and sound . I enjoyed it and i think a dollar is cheap for over an hour of fun .	1
In my top 5 favorite point & amp ; click games ! No glitches ; lots of play time for your money ; above par graphics ; fun & amp ; challenging puzzles ! Great for an hour or two of fun ! !	1
very good game to do with your 5-10 year old , challenging enough and a touch spooky . worth the price for sure .	1
ABSOLUTLY AWESOME game ! ! ! We played it for three days and eventually had to look at the walkthrough video LOL . We loved the game and would love to have a sequel to keep us busy . We loved how each item found had to be used to gain another item . Thank you so much for the fun and adventure . PLEASE make a sequel ! ! ! !	1
I downloaded The lost city when it was free , and I loved it . ( It was n't too short , but I would n't of been dissapointed if it had been longer . ) I read the reviews for The secret of Grisly manor , and seeing it was made by the same people as The lost city , I bought it for $ 0.99 . I had read reviews , and some people said it was very short , and I figured it would be as long as the other one ( Which took me about a week ) . I was very wrong..I could 've finished it in half an hour.So I gave The secret of Grisly Manor 4 stars , because I was dissapointed in the length . ( In my opinion . it should be free - it was n't long enough to be worth even a dollar . ) If you 're going to purchase one , purchase The lost city - you wo n't be dissapointed !	1
This game is so much fun , tests your brain , and has awesome graphics ! ! ! I played this with my kids and we all had a great time solving the mystery together . Definitely worth buying ! ! Works great on Xoom tablet !	1
Would love to see more apps like this . Reminds me of everything from old NES games to Myst . Love love love.Give me more please . : )	1
I thought this was a great app , especially since I got it for free.It was a little short but I think the soundtrack and puzzles were great . Keep it up !	1
This so was great fun , even tho it was short . Looking forward to a sequel . It is quite easy . Remember to shut the door behind you . : ) Samsung fascinate .	1
Love point and click games and this one was cleverly designed for phone use . I hope there are more soon !	1
I really enjoyed this short but challenging game . The graphics were pretty good . The puzzles make you think but its not impossible to figure out . Look forward to seeing more games like this from developer . HTC Droid Incredible .	1
Game was very fun ! Played great on the Thunderbolt . Wish it had more challenges . If you rate it low because of its size , it 's time for you to upgrade your phone .	1
I really liked this game , probably one of the more fun adventure type games on android devices , works great on the fire.But as everyone else has said it is only good for an hour or two and then your just left wanting more . I rated it four stars because it is fun , and was worth a dollar . Hope they make more games like this ( or port over myst for the fire )	1
fun for the entire family . my 6 year old could even play with some help.overall a great game ... though could be a bit longer .	1
It was a little too short and a little too easy , but it was a fun way to pass the time . And being an adventure game scores extra points in my book right off the bat !	1
This game is awsome this game is my favorete game I have ever played in my life it is so cool	1
I love this game and would recommend it to everyone that enjoys playing games on their computer so buy it .	1
I love puzzle games like this . The puzzles forced you to think but they were n't overly frustrating as some of the longer versions can be . Great fun without days and days of commitment . I had no problems on my Kindle Fire and it was an excellent value .	1
Fairly entertaining but extremely short . Not the hardest puzzle mystery game , but can pose a challenge at a spot or two . Replayability is zero.Four those having FC issues , reboot your device .	1
just finished this game great puzzle makes you think kind of game wish it was as long as the lost city another great game get this game if you like puzzles games	1
I love all of the fire maple games available . this one was a little short but still very pleased with it for only $ .99 . once I start it is hard to put it down !	1
I really enjoying this style of games ; its a shame there are n't many out there.. This game was entertaining and fun . More thought process needed than playing angry birds .	1
Was a little short but I enjoyed following the logical clues . Certainly was worth the .99 I spent on it and hope there will be other similar titles .	1
I really enjoyed this game . It was short but had a few interesting puzzle pieces . If you follow the clues , read the signs and use a little creative ideas , you can solve this without going insane . Some items you use more than once ... ( that should help last little ) . I would recommend this game without hesitation .	1
It worked great on my Samsung Fascinate . I really enjoyed it & amp ; hope there will be more games like this soon . I do n't understand all the negative reviews . It might not be as long & amp ; in depth as a pc game , but what do you expect for $ 0.99 ( or free if you got it on the right day ) ? I think it was great !	1
This is a true point and click game , NO HIDDEN OBJECTS , YEA ! Find OBJECTS and figure out where and how to use them . This game is not overpriced for the fun you will have . For those deducting stars due to length of game , maybe you should go to a 2 hour movie and see how much entertainment you get for the money . THIS IS WORTH EVERY PENNY !	1
My son and I played this together and had a great time . He is four years old and really enjoyed the puzzles as well as the music and theme .	1
Very interesting game.. I love all hidden object games , especially ones with a story line and you have to figure out what happened	1
I got this when it was only 49 cents , so I feel like I got a great deal . It was the first touch and solve game that I have played and I really have enjoyed it . I got the Lost City which is harder but I think I found some new games I really like ! keep up the great games !	1
loved this short game . definately left me wanting MORE ! I was always a fan of Myst games and this has that same gameplay . it was even a little creepy . perfection .	1
Fire Maple put together a very entertaining game with this one . The only reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of five is because it is so short . It downloaded to my Kindle fire without any trouble . This game has wonderful graphics , a very engaging puzzle , and kept my interest very well . It was a good game and I hated to see it end . I hope to see more from this company .	1
I played this immediately after the Mystery of the Crimson Manor , and it really feels like it was trying to be the same game . To be fair , a point-and-click adventure game featuring puzzles around a an abandoned mansion is hardly a new idea , but it felt like plagiarism.Regardless , the Secret of Grisly Manor holds up ok on its own.Pros : Challenging puzzles , point-and-click gameplay , decent atmosphereCons : way too short ( about 1/2 hour ) , poorly detailed graphics ( looks like very old compression ) , a couple of seemingly arbitrary puzzles/solutionsConclusion : I pray that we are seeing a revival of point-and-click adventure games for tablets . Buy this game if you have 49 cents to spare , enjoy classic adventure games , and have already played the Mystery of Crimson Manor .	1
fun game a little short but cool puzzles looks amazing ran smooth on Droid incredible keep up the good work ca n't wait for more of this game or another location	1
Drag and drop clues to find the secret to grampa 's house . Graphics were great , no glitches on the Fire and it 's not overly challenging . It 's too short though . I think it took about an hour to finish , but for 99 cents I had fun . The ending leaves the door open for future gameplay so hopefully the developers are hard at work .	1
very fun and kinds hard very short I recommend the lost city which is longer I finished it in about 30mins but very well made	1
This game was a lot of fun but I finished it in 30 minutes . There should be more to the story .	1
Worked flawlessly on galaxy s vibrant 2.2.3 . Good game though short . Why does a review require 20words min ? Dumb . Dumb .	1
This was a very fun puzzle adventure game . Short , sure , but totally worth it . Especially being free today . Graphics and gameplay are spot on . More variety in music might be nice . Level of challenge perfect , but may be a bit steep for users that are new to this genre . Check it out ! Ca n't wait for new chapters .	1
I loved this game . as soon as I became completely addicted it was over . my only complaint is that it was short . fire maple games makes good stuff ... if you liked this try the lost city I think its called . same kind of game , just longer . : )	1
great puzzle game . works great on kindle fire hd 7 & # 34 ; . you have to back to rooms several times after finding items . rooms have great visuals . you do not have to purchase in app items with real money which i hate in an app	1
I like these types of games , unfortunately I am no longer patient enough to figure them out completely so I had to cheat a couple times . Looking forward to more !	1
I enjoyed the game very much . There is not a help/spoiler file , but it 's really not needed . The one place I got stuck - throw the pretty box in the fire ! The graphics are beautiful , the play is smooth . The sound is not as good as the sound on The Lost City , but not bad . Really , this would get 5 stars if only it was longer . I 'd prefer something like Myst ; something to take days/weeks to complete , rather than a couple of hours .	1
People leaving negative reviews need to realize that the developer has to make this work across hundreds of different phones . Just because it 's Android , does n't mean all Androids work the same ! EMAIL THE DEVELOPER IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM ! It 's the only way to get it fixed . Save your review for an honest , working , tried out the app , opinion ! This app is absolutely wonderful ! If you like games like & quot ; Mist & quot ; you will love this !	1
Great game but short , and the ending was rather lackluster . It was fun to explore though , and good graphics . It 's a good game for kids and adults alike	1
When i played this game i codenot wate to fisen.I play for 9 days and a can not win.But i will cape playing .	1
Got stuck a couple times but put the game down for a while and figured it out eventually . Game provided hours of fun and puzzles . I hope they make lots more of these games !	1
this app is so cool u have to find your long lost grandpa that has dissapers . I love these kinds apps.I hope that every body will get this app and rate it a good review .	1
Enjoyed this game very much . Short , with a couple of minor stumpers . Definitely worth the cost . Hoping for a sequel .	1
A great point and click game . You have to go through a house and find clues and apply them . No annoying hidden objects . All the clues are reasonable and discoverable , and you have hints available too . I only wish the game were a bit longer . This is also a good introduction to this kind of game for newbies or younger players , at least in part because you will be able to finish it and not have to go through fifteen scenes to get back to where you need . I wish Fire Maple would make more games like this !	1
a couple of the puzzles ( mainly the globe ) had mestumped for a little bit . I love this kind of game on the phone , wish there were more . Samsung Galaxy Tab .	1
This game is awesome ! It has a great spooky feel . Ive been waiting for this genre of game for awhile now . It 's exciting to see what will come out next ! On the downside it felt to short or maybe it just left me wanting more !	1
This game is a bit short , but it is well done and fun to play . I wish there were more adventure games like this for Android .	1
This is a good game , but I am stuck and ca n't seem to get very far into solving the puzzle . I am sure it is me , but I do n't enjoy being stuck in the same spot for months . Maybe something is missing from the game ?	1
I wish I could find more games like this one . You have to think about solving it not just tap on random areas.It is a little short , I Wish it was longer , but enjoyed playing it !	1
If you enjoy quick ( a few hours long ) games of point and click puzzles and little mysteries , you 'll like this game . It 's plenty of fun for the low price .	1
I 'm playing it . not in to the game right now so I not to mach to say about it	1
I really liked this game . It 's something like a mystery game where you look for clues and solve little puzzles . Not too hard not too obvious either . Would be a good game to play by yourself or your kid ( I recommend it for 10+ ) . As many others noted , the game is short and it 's over in less than an hour . I still recommend this game .	1
Would get 5 stars if game was much longer . Less than an hour to complete . Loved the game overall . Update with more places to explore !	1
Great game ! Keeps you occupied & interested . Only bad thing is that I finished the game in like 4 hours . I have played The Haunt which is excellent . Very similar to this game but a little harder and longer took me about 2 weeks to complete .	1
I had a great time playing this thing.It was just hard enough to make it fun but not so difficult that you would loose interest ! I ca n't wait for the sequel ! I would definitely recommend .	1
I only got this because it was free today , but I 'm so glad I did ! Super fun , love all the clues and thinking you have to do . I only wish it was a longer story , or there were others to do once you were done .	1
I enjoyed this little puzzle game . out was indeed short and has very little replay value but it was with going through . Not sure I would have wanted to party for it . Samsung vibrant .	1
I did enjoy this game . I spent time playing it when I should have been doing something more constructive , but it held my attention and most of the puzzles were n't TOO easy . Well , for the most part anyway . It was way to short though . A couple of hours and done .	1
A definite must for Myst fans or the like . Great graphics and challenging puzzles . I would love to see this dev release another game like this as they did such a good job with this one . Check out the Lost City by the same dev . It 's another game just as equally awesome as this one .	1
works great on HTC EVO 4g . can not install on SD card . it was fun but a little short . never had a problem with it .	1
Amazing game great graphics . Unreal how it gets 1 star from people who have a phone that FC ' s ... .ever think about maybe its your phone moron ... maybe all the other Free crap on it is sucking up your memory . Anywho..Fantastic game !	1
I enjoyed this one , just wish it would have had a map . It was fun but not memorable . I will keep it on my Kindle to play again another time	1
Really enjoyed figuring out all the clues . Not too hard where you get frustrated but just right to get the brain juices flowing .	1
If you seem to be having issues , it may be your phone . They say that any Android is a good Android , but they say a lot of things . Much like anything else , if you buy something cheap , it will work like something cheap . Also , people need to learn their phones . no matter what anyone tells you , they do n't REALLY think for you . Anyway , this works great on the Samsung Fascinate , and even if it did n't , I 'm not the type to complain about something free . People today ... ..I swear . LOL	1
This game sounds very interesting to me if I had the money I would seriously buy this game . Also I 've alwaysed love mystery games anyway .	1
It was super fun ! Ive always loved these types of games , its just a shame that the story ends so suddenly and was a quick play . Great graphics , cool music , and look forward to more games like this from this company ... Yay !	1
I use this app at work and at home and it 's been perfect . From recipes to measurements to weights and volume ... everything in between .	1
This is a very handy app ! I use it constantly to convert everything ! If you have been raised using inches and feet this app sure helps for metric conversion !	1
This came in VERY handy at work the other day when converting GSM and Meters in the metric system to inches and feet for a Printing paper estimate .	1
Excellent for all types of measurements . I like the currency conversion . Easy to use . And does n't take up much space .	1
It took a few minutes experimenting to see how it worked , but then I was off and running , I 've converted liters to miles for gas mileage , and pounds to grams or kilos . It does n't seem to have a limit as far as I can see . A very handy travel accessory.Anyone having to deal with different measurements should find this app most useful .	1
I use this all the time to help me with quick computations where I do n't have ( or want to take ) the time do conversions on paper . Works as advertised .	1
Has a lot of useful conversion tools in it . This is one of those tools that gathers dust until you really need it . It 's a must for people that work in a technical environment and needs to from time to time make a conversion that is not in the norm of daily work .	1
This is a great usefull app . One can convert about any unit of about anything to any unit of anything else . Honestly .	1
The type size is a bit small -- is that me , my Kindle or the App ? I do n't know ; I 'm new !	1
I use these apps everyday and I love them . I 'm so glad I downloaded them to my cell phone . Absolutely essential apps to have .	1
I LOVE music so this is a great app to have ! Especially because I listen to music everyday of my life .	1
The main reason I like the Amazon MP3 player is that it has the best fast-forward/rewind controls for long tracks such as podcasts or audio books . All the other player either skip too-large sections , or otherwise are not workable for long tracks.The ability to access tracks in my cloud is also nice .	1
I had already loaded up my SD card on my Galaxy S III with tunes from my large CD collection and also added plenty to my Amazon Cloud storage , so I was n't too worried about having enough music to listen to . However , the Prime Music Service has dozens of playlist that I spent hours reviewing and adding to my favorites . I recommend everyone who loves music to check it out . The catalog from some of the top labels are not available , but it is still an impressive collection !	1
It 's nice to know that some of the songs from CDs that I ordered are on it , and I did n't even download them there . So that was a very nice surprise . I downloaded this app on my Android phone , my tablet , and my PC . So I can listen to my music anywhere I go , as long as I have one of the three devices	1
This is a good app , works like it 's suppost to . I like that it warns you before you download a song that it might use data . Never have problems buffering .	1
My girlfriend showed me this and I was thrilled , thank you Amazon . I will be putting it to much practice over a long period of time .	1
I had this app on my Blackberry and quickly loaded it onto my EVO after upgrading . I buy all my music on Amazon and this application has a great interface to purchase music on the go . The recent addition if the music player is fantastic , but needs a larger widget option and lock screen options . As soon as these get incorporated into the app , it will be a 5 star .	1
I have this on my phone and tablet so I have my music wherever I go . Great for when I 'm out walking . Love my music !	1
I can listen to everything on the Amazon Cloud . Nice to stream over my Galaxy S3 no matter where I am .	1
Almost perfect . My problem with this ap is I have over 2000 songs but it only shows me 2k . Why Amazon ?	1
Amazon has earned my respect with this app . This is n't the old amazon mp3 player which was n't bad but nothin special just like itunes with cheaper albums most of the time , but now this is the future of music in my honest opinion . The cloud player service makes this the best thing to happen to music in a long . Now you can upload all your music to there website and have access to all your music without taking up space on your devices anymore . Also great if you like me always have to transfer song from multiple devices now you can just upload or buy from amazon have access to everything instantly from any device that can use the service . Android phone/tablet pc or MAC computer . So you get to keep your music forever unlike itunes one time purchase and goodlook with keep your music safe . See even if you music device fails you instantly have all your music back.Thanks for making something we always needed .	1
The only problem with this app is that as your online music is added the install gets bloated . Which is understandable , but sucks if you need to keep as much as possible on the sd card .	1
I have installed the cloud player on all my devices , which was easy and no issues encountered . Able to play my music any where . If you like music then you will like this !	1
I have been using this app for several months and it works like a charm . Lock screen w/ability to stop , play & amp ; rewind , ROCKS ! I have been extremely pleased with this app .	1
if you want to order MP3 music on your android phone this works great . I assume Amazon thinks so and I do too .	1
It downloads mp3 files just fine on my android phone . No problems encountered with this , teamed up with Amazon music you ca n't go wrong .	1
But I 'm sure it works fine . I just have never had a need for running Amazon MP3 's through my phone , although I thought I would .	1
Very small limit for free users in comparison to other services , but it 's still pretty good and if you have an Amazon device ( ex . Kindle ) this app is very ideal .	1
I love to be able to listen to music and purchase music at the same time . Its also great to have access to the new releases or by genre even on my phone ! ! ! Wonderful APP for an android !	1
I have not yet been able to figure out how to get all of my previously owned music to play on it .	1
I cheered when Amazon started selling MP3 music a few years ago . It was time for Apple 's iTunes to get some serious competition , and Amazon 's MP3 store has done that . With the MP3 app being integrated with the Amazon Cloud , it 's now easy to purchase or play my music from my Android phone and tablet .	1
I really like this app ... Now I can listen to my music from my phone without having to log into the cloud player .	1
Nice selection of music . I enjoy a variety of genre in music . I do n't always want to purchase complete albums . I also enjoy the preselected playlists .	1
I thought this product was good but the only thing was the shuffle on this app kept repeating the songs I had on my device in that order .	1
My mother downloaded a bunch of music for me and I love this because I can listen to all of my music and some of hers .	1
The number one benefit of this music app for me is the ability to sync music to multiple devices easily with a wifi signal . That was my criteria for choosing this type of app . I like that we can play the music by accessing the amazon music cloud and not just by downloading each song on my kindle as long as I have wifi . I vary the amount of music I want loaded in my kindle and this app makes it easy and convenient to download individual songs or remove them and leave them only in the music cloud to save space . There is a limit to space available without paying for more and it is ok but not great . How can we complain though for a free app with free reliable service . The music streams seamlessly from the app or the cloud when playing , as well	1
It plays loudly and clearly on my cell phone . It is transferred to the cloud . I have to take some time playing it sometimes , but I always find it . I do n't do music often .	1
Comes in really handy to be able to access you music downloads on other devices , which is great ! ! I love this app !	1
I use this app constantly on my computer it is so much nicer than having to spend the computer memory space on iTunes !	1
It works great and I like how affordable the songs are . It gives me access to all my amazon music .	1
the cloud player is a great feature on the app . i like that feature a lot and the music plays nice	1
great app would like to be able to download song from my files on my tablet though ... ..thank you ... god speed	1
love it hands down . being able to have my music anywhere without eating up space on my sd card . also not having to fumble with syncing with the pc is a plus	1
I love this app if I found a song on the radio I can easily purchase to have on my phone ! best part is I have soundhound app to find song info and I can buy from amazon straight from the soundhound app . love it !	1
mp3 is great for music , I use no other because everyone is using this now and you do n't even have to go to the music store anymore especaily the mall , aweful prices , I do n't buy cds anymore just download mp3s easy and quick and great . I buy all my mp3 's here on amazon . no other place !	1
I love my cloud player and have been using it since its humble beginnings . It has come a long way and only gets better . Online editing of metadata helps to fix my music collection and keep things organized . Their music is reasonably priced most of the time in comparison to other MP3 vendors out there too . My only minor complaint is on the recent device limits set . I have several android devices , which I think is probably making me more of an exception . Regardless , five as a device limit causes me to pick and choose more often than I like . Ten would be a better number .	1
mp3 uploads from my PC take a while , but this app works really well . I use it mainly on a motorcycle via bluetooth into my helmet speakers , so not always with the strongest cell signal and never wifi . Amazon mp3 app stays connected more than any other internet music site , and reconnects the most when going in and out of service areas like on mountain roads .	1
Terrific concept : just what a cloud player should be ! Generous amount of uploads of my own music and unlimited storage of purchased music so a little incentive there to look around and see what Amazon has to offer . Playlists and up to 10 devices so all members of the family can have their music- even iOs devices along with droid . One Wish : categories by genre : classical , pop , country etc are all mixed together so there 's a bit of wading thru just to remember what 's on there .	1
Good , but should have more options like , playing from any cloud server and should include playing all kinds of media files in future	1
So far I think its great good selection and functional app that I can tell had a lot of time put into it thanks Amazon your the best .	1
This is a fast easy to use app that brings music right to your phone . I love being able to download the music onto my phone instead of transferring it from PC to phone . I also love that your purchases are saved in the cloud . Everyone knows how frustrating it is when your phone goes crazy and you lose everything . With this app you can put it right back with a few simple steps . It 's great .	1
I really like my apps and I use then all the time . I am always on the go and I really use each and every one . I love that I can purchase the apps that I 'm interested in and I can use them right away . I always have my music with me	1
I previously wrote a negative review years ago ... But now ? WOW ! Prime Music has changed everything for me , and I 'm happy to endorse this app and the service ! I 've deleted the old review and have totally changed my mind.My only complaint now is that this app is NOT compatible ( or available ) on Amazon Fire TV , and this just does n't make sense ! I can load Pandora and a dozen other music services on the Fire TV , but Amazon 's own Prime Music service is n't available on their own hardware ? WHY ? ! ? Amazon , PLEASE get with it and put this app on the Amazon Fire TV ! I would definitely get a lot of use out of it ! ! !	1
What a great idea ! Easy to use and I love having every CD I purchased ( of recent years ) right there in MP3 format on the cloud ! Love it !	1
I 've used Amazon MP3 for quite a while now . I wish they 've developed a better system for their music though . It 's nice to be able to put your own music in the cloud and purchase additional music . The app does n't seem polished though .	1
Easily picks up your library of music on your phone and syncs up with Amazons cloud player . Especially loving this with the addition of the new Auto Rip feature !	1
Another good app for our Kindle Fire . The & # 34 ; Daily Deal & # 34 ; is nice to have . Easy to use like most Android apps .	1
It 's not all that sophisticated of an App , but it serves the purpose . But it works great for me because I use several phones ( one for each region I frequently travel to ) and it 's nice to have my music with me whenever I want to play them . Best part of it is I do n't have to load down the already limited memory of my phones with the entire library . I can just stream the playlist ( or artist , album , etc . ) that I want to listen to .	1
Great songs , sound and great price . Not only all that but you earn as you buy . I earned one song of my choice for buying this cd . and the song you pick automatically just downloads to any device you want it too . OH first install this MP3 on your device . I installed it on my Android phone	1
so easy to use ... download and cloud program is nice ! I love the preview feature however I wish the previews were a bit longer .	1
I really hate writing reviews for apps since I do not necessarily know what to compare to . This app works as expected .	1
I love that I have this App . on several devises and I do n't have to sit for hours trying to transfer my music !	1
This is a pretty good application , I think that it could use a refresh here and there though . -Otherwise , a good app	1
Amazon Mp3 dosent miss skip ! ! ! It is very clear . The Sound is just Awesome , dosenot skip a beat , The bass is right om , the Trebbile too ! ! ! ! TRULY I FEEL , YOU CAN NOT GO WRONG WITH AMAZON ! ! ! !	1
I use my Kindle Fire at home to listen to music . Now I just grab my phone and get in the car and hook up with the blue tooth and have all my music with me . It 's the same simple format as the Kindle and I can play right out of the cloud without having any music on my phone and all . I read all the reviews complaining about the app size . And I 'm surprised that people so tech savvy have not figured out why they ca n't get the music to their SD cards . It 's a business process , not a personal issue , or a technical aspect.I suggest they should put down their phones and live life a bit . Maybe even put a soundtrack to it .	1
As with any song using the MP3 app was really easy , and the cloud feature , that allows you to take your purchses anywhere and play thm on any device is just perfect .	1
This is honestly the best app ever . I uploaded all of my CDs to the cloud , and I use it to listen to my music on my computer in my office . I can also plug my phone into my cars stereo and it works great even over 3g .	1
I like this app because it is one the best for a android and very easy to use glad this app is available	1
Yep ... love this player . Works great ! Amazon is the best . I can find anything I ever need and love seeing reviews	1
I am still trying to get the hang of this app here . But so far I am enjoying this pretty good . Thanks .	1
I buy all my music from Amazon . Great prices , great functionality . Out of cheer curiosity I had to see why this app did n't have a full 5 star average . Turns out their phones suck and they 're blaming the app . Here 's an idea . If your phones not functioning correctly call your provider and get a new one . Than you 'll be praying amazon MP3 for free early upgrades .	1
I so recommend this product . I can play my music on my Laptop , my big computer and my android ... ... .i recommend this great app .	1
I titled my review surprise BC of all the poor to medicore reviews I have read . Let me start this review off by saying its not the developers fault the your carrier decided to load ur phone full of bloatware . So do n't just rate something 1 star BC ur pissed u ca n't delete bloatware.MY devices Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 and Samsung Droid Charge ( Verizon ) This app is great in my opinion . It does all it says . Cloud play is great . I read some ppl claiming that their music got lost . If this is the case for u make sure when buying ur music it was saved to the cloud drive . All music bought from amazon is free to store in the cloud and unlimited . However uploaded music is limited to 5gb which is quite small . So when choosing b/w Google Music and Amazon that 's something to consider . Both players are equally good . I think the deciding factor here is where you have bought more music . personally I have bought more from Amazon BC of the $ 5 alblums which are cheaper than what Google sells music for.1annoying thing is the app does emphasize the store part of the app as much as the player . The album view could also be made to look more aesthetic .	1
& quot ; this game took over my home screen ! & quot ; it 's not a game its a live wallpaper , like it says ! & quot ; uses too much battery . & quot ; that 's what a live wallpaper does , if you do n't like it then do n't use it but do n't downrate the wallpaper for it.reviews are meant to be a review of the quality of the app.. if you do n't understand what it is or what it does then freaking ask before rating.great app , super cute for Halloween . runs well on my myTouch 4G and is way better than most live wallpapers i 've used	1
my daughter loves these live wallpapers ! the bad reviews need to find a live . does what it says , great graphics ! ! ! and no way , it will use more battery ? ? ? I was fully aware BEFORE I downloaded .	1
Nice live wallpaper , seasonally appropriate . Interesting pumpkin explosions , good art . Nice design and well thought out . Worth it , 'nuff said .	1
This is a nice Halloween live wallpaper just in time for Halloween . Yes , this will use your battery and computer processor if you worry about that sort if thing.Ph : Optimus V	1
It 's that time of year , so I 'll download this and back it up for safekeeping for years to come . Nice to switch to a holiday themed wallpaper for a couple weeks a year .	1
I love this wallpaper it fun and work very good sometime it take some time for the apps to show but other then that it works geart .	1
I love smashing the pumpkins and pretending they are the soft skulls of the one star reviewers . It 's seasonal and my son likes it . I 'll just charge my phone earlier than normal for . couple of weeks.I am a bit disappointed because it did n't actually carve a pumpkin for me . Shame on you Amazon . LOL , dorks !	1
This app is the greatest thing since 1979 . It flew straight to my heart like a Bullet with Butterfly Wings . I plan on using it Today and Tonight , Tonight . I ca n't wait for the sequel : Halloween Zwan Live Wallpaper .	1
Well I was already in the spirit- love halloween , so was happy to see this as the faotd this morning . and it 's a nice change from all the games ( not that I have a prob with freer games ; ) my daughter likes smashing the pumpkins and knocking down the bats !	1
This is a fun wallpaper that I put on my phone and tablet every Halloween season . It work great on both .	1
this is a pretty cool live wallpaper . you can smash pumpkins , adjust the amount of pumpkins , change the background and fog color . also knock the bats down . i only gave it four stars because i think sound would have made it really fantastic . regardless , it 's a live wallpaper , install it and edit settings like you would any other live wallpaper . this will be fun to have this time of year . thanks amazon for the faotd .	1
Fun live wallpaper where the jack o lanterns explode and the bats die when I tap them . Does n't appear to bog down my Droid X either . I 'm curious to see what the battery life will be like	1
I laughed at the initial reviews.. then thought to myself , are these people for real ? Then it scared me how many incompetent people are actually among us..cute LW ... my kids like it a lot ! fun to get into the spirit of Halloween ! like another review said , hopefully they will incorporate other holidays !	1
this is a fun live wallpaper . i lve that you can smash the pumpkins and hit the bats right on the home screen . comes with additional backgrounds to use if you prefer something other than the pumpkin patch . would be great to set actual position of pumpkins on screen or dim the background as all the bright colors sort of muddle the app icons on my home screen . overall a nice wallpaper for the Halloween season . ( LG Optimus V )	1
very repetitive , but entertaining , nonetheless . I do like exploding the bats and pumpkins . it basically does what I would expect a live wallpaper to do .	1
This app has worked flawless on my Droid X . It is a quick app , does n't slow down the phone and uses the battery intelligently.For those crying about the permissions , on mine , it is stopping animations when the screen is off , thus saving processing power and your battery.Yes , it should be set up as a game also , but I love the Live Wallpapers that are interactive . The graphics are very cartoonish , but a great free app .	1
Having a smart phone doesnt make you smart . I suggest selling your smart phone and getting a Jitter Bug . Nice WALLPAPER by the way	1
I installed this app on my phone and my kids love it . My seven year old boy just spent 5 minutes cracking up as he exploded pumpkins and shot down bats .	1
Really like the wallpaper its really neat to smash the pumpkins very interactive app . Like that there 's a lot of stuff moving . Like any live wallpaper it will eat your battery .	1
I use this one every day to check on the major stories in British newspapers . I found out while living there that the points of view of other countries is invaluable for understanding what 's going on in the world . This app has many , many British papers .	1
I did not know there were these many papers in the whole of England . Totally blew my mind.This app is great if you figuring out the political and local news of Great Britain is fun . Comprehensive in scope and great syncing with my Kindle Fire and Fire HD . Pulling out papers and articles was a breeze.Great app for the news junkie !	1
Simple app that links to the various mobile sites for the various newspapers . You could just visit the sites in your browser , but it 's helpful to have them all here in one place and there 's no need to search Google to find the URLs .	1
So obviously this is a one trick pony application , but I could n't ask for more . The flicking motion is fun , the colors are awesome and being able to wave it is just plain cool .	1
I got this app and it was great . Then I got the update that gives you a whole new selection of lighters to choose from !	1
This is really cool the way it the flame moves I wish there would be more choices for the lighter case	1
Seeing as I am new to WordPress , but not new to blogging , I wanted to have something to write short bits from Kindle Fire HD . I came across this and absolutely love it ! Not only can I easily compose a great blog entry with my stylus ( having a pain disorder this is the best way to write ) , but I can also check my blogs stats , and also read the blogs that I follow with this great app !	1
works well , easy set up if you already have a blog , tap the bottom center , 3 lines in a boxadd a blogpreferences : comment notify , update interval , play a sound , vibrate , blink , post a signature , tag line to new postscan add a new post , new page , quick photo/video , display pages , view comments [ edit , reply , spam , approve , trashsettings , account details , , media , [ set default image size , upload/link to full or scaled imagelocation , geotagging the post , reader option , this is where you will find the blogs your are following , stats , tracks the viewswould give it a 5 star , missing the logout . option , can not figure out how to logout .	1
I do n't type well with my thumbs , so I save my posts for when I 'm at a keyboard , but it 's handy to keep up with the blogs I follow with this app . ( The web version can be awkward and clunky , too , so the issues are n't just with the app . )	1
The application is easy to use for the most part and allows full access to the features of Wordpress on a web platform .	1
I use this app on all of my devices and I never have errors . It 's . easy to use and navigate through .	1
Easy to use and works well for free product . Wish was a little more flexible , but can not beat features for the price ! !	1
I like the accessibility the WordPress app has on my Kindle Fire . Fairly quick to upload and get started , it is good on the go blog feature to have .	1
If you have a Word Press Blog , this is the app to use to do quick blogs on the go ! Very easy to use and understand by those who use WordPress . Add pictures from your camera and works great with my Kindle Fire HDX .	1
I 'm not always home to blog or respond to comments , and this app makes it easy to do so . You can add or edit pages and check your stats as well . Definitely worth having for all Wordpress bloggers .	1
this app is great for anyone who has a wordpress blog on the site it self . this app is one of the best i have downloaded even though it was on a different item . its easy to use and it is very user friendly	1
Word press gives me the tools I need to write and correct my wording as well as add graphics to make my blog look nice .	1
As I open this application I can easily tell that my scheduled post has posted or I can work on my drafts . I also have the options to reply to my readers comments too . I can do ALMOST everything on my Kindle that I can on the computer through this app . ( If you want to do something pertaining to a plug in feature it may not show up on here ) I blog with WordPress.org and am using a Kindle Fire HD	1
Definitely one of the best mobile blogging programs and getting better with every revision . If you have a WordPress.com blog and want to go mobile , this is by far the best option . The App makes adding photos , videos and pages simple . Works great on 2.2+ and the Toshiba Thrive ( 3.1 ) tablet .	1
I use this app for just about everything with my WordPress account . It is simple and not to messy . You can update blogs or reply right from the app .	1
This app makes wordpress super easy to use , but I saw a few drawbacks ... I could n't catergorize anything and it was kind of hard for me to navigate around to find the exact things I needed sometimes .	1
I can now write on the go with this app from WordPress . It makes keeping up to date on my website a snap !	1
works great on my kindle fire , exactly what I was looking for to do a quick post or check on stats for all my blots , very convinient .	1
If they are famous , yuo can find them here - this app rocks ! Great for quick answers and even includes tv shows !	1
Greatest reference for movie and television look ups and trivia contests and playing 60 degrees of Kevin Bacon . Ca n't stop searching once you get started .	1
Great for information about your favorite movies and TV series . Ca n't watch movies or purchase them through here but if you want to find out who 's who castings and info about the movie , this is the place to go .	1
Just downloaded and thought it would be great for me to keep up with what was going on in the movies and tv	1
I like to check on new movies coming out at the theater or on DVD . I can watch the trailers , find a theater where something is playing , and even get my tickets right over the smart phone.So far , works as advertised with no problems.I 'm running it on a new Samsung Galaxy S3 running Android 4.0.4	1
I use this frequently to look up stars and other movies they 've been in . Shows and it also has up coming movies trailers . Very useful tool if you see what movie your favorite star is playing .	1
Works very well on my cheapo android tablet . Does n't have all the trailers but has enough to keep me busy for awile . Not to much to say but excellent movie trailer and info app .	1
This app gives me all the info I need about movies & stars , just like on my desktop , . I use it mostly while watching TCM right in front of the TV . It 's quick & convenient !	1
When you 're trying to remember that movie or who was in it or even & # 34 ; what year was that ? & # 34 ; . This app is handy and you can get all the details . It formats nicely for the device you 're using .	1
Okay there was just an update , so some of this may have been addressed . I love the app when looking for a movie , and I am kind of an IMDb junkie so in general like the tool.The thing that was bugging me was the news feeds . They would get stale , and could n't figure out how to refresh ( and I am talking by weeks not hours ) .So that may have been addressed in the last release.Also would be nice to attach to Amazon more ( since it is owned by them ) so I could watch directly or see pricing easier but I may just not know how to work that.The trailer stream great even at 3G which is good when you got to entertain a 4 yo for a few minutes .	1
Love movies so I can research them , see trailers , plan out my movie watching for the week- amazing what you can do with tablets and smart phones .	1
I use this app constantly . Love movies so I can research them , see trailers , plan out my movie watching for the week- amazing what you can do with tablets and smart phones . This is an old ( 64 yrs ) codger who continues to be amazed by the benefits of technology . Go see a movie after you download this app .	1
used this several times to look for old movies that are not in circulation anymore , so far works like a champ ... .no complaints from me ... thanks	1
I find it faster to boot up my tablet to check IMDb then my PC and the pages shown are just as feature rich .	1
Sometimes you just have to know all of the movies Al Pacino was in or who directed Superman 5000 . I discovered there are articles about certain programs that you can get . I 'm greatly amused by all of the attention being paid to Downton Abbey that I would n't know anything about without IMDB on my phone . It 's great for finding upcoming movies , too . Another very nicely done app .	1
I use this app mainly for the notification feature . You can choose to be notified about news and/or buzz about your favorite shows and movies , so you never have to miss out !	1
This app is simple to use and does exactly what it says . Easily look up movie info , actors etc . I use it quite often .	1
great to look stuff up on the go . when away from the computer i can just pop this open on the phone .	1
This is a smart phone app ( Android ) . that gives you data on almost any TV show or movie or actor you can think of . This app is a good source for Bio information and movie ratings .	1
I use this App constantly . Anytime I watch a movie or show and recognize someone , I look them up from here . This app also does a great job at providing any and all info regarding movies/tv . Great site	1
Good way to keep up to date with movie information . Having an app makes it easier to find the data compared to browser bookmark .	1
I find myself using this all the time . It 's straightforward , and its free . Could n't ask for more . I 'll say it 's fast , and i 've enjoyed using it . Ca n't imagine this app not being on someones phone.Droid X	1
This might be my favorite Android app of all ! Nice clean interface , super fast , intuitive navigation , small footprint , accurate information , and FREE ! ! I wish all apps were as well designed and efficient as this little beauty .	1
it does it all , everything you 'd ever need to know about a movie or tv , all in 1 etu app	1
THIS IS A GREAT AP . VERY VERSITAL . EASY TO USE AND SEARCH FORANY MOVIE YOU CAN THINK OF . YOU WO N'T REGRET GETTING IT .	1
I 've been using IMDB since it was a series of lists and ballots swapped over USEnet . The times have change , but IMDB is still the best .	1
This app was a great app . I can tune my grand kids in to tv when we are traveling . Thanks	1
There 's a lot of times when watching tv where my husband or I will say & # 34 ; what movie did I see that little girl in ( or actor , actress , young man , whatever ) . Imdb lets you search information about cast , crew , music , episodes , etc .	1
FAST and EASY to USE ! This is simply the fastest best way to find basic information on movies , TV shows , and actors . There are reviews , plot synopsis , ratings , bios , pretty much anything you could want short of hard core detailed research .	1
I enjoy this game a lot more than I normally like this type of game . It has become one of my top three games .	1
beginner is a little to easy , but it is fun and simple to play . would recommend to anyone that enjoys word games	1
This is one of the better word games I 've played . I just made it to dungeon 6 on the normal level and it was challenging and fun to me . It reminds me of the game Bookworm Adventures . I would have given 5 stars if I did n't have to go back to the very beginning when time runs out . That is annoying .	1
As always , the first thing I did was checked out the settings because most game music and sounds are . annoying to me . I found one setting turned off the jumble feature . Obviously those complaining about this never checked the settings or help . My problem with the settings , though , is that the current state is not displayed . Each time you touch the option button , it goggles to the opposite state . If that 's not the one you want , you have to toggle again.I started with the kids mode just to sample the interface and game play . So far so good . It 's not a true RPG . You advance a level ( dungeon ) by making words . The higher the value of the word the more destructive it is against the level 's monster . Each fight depletes some of your health . When out of health the game ends.Final word : be skeptical of low ratings . The player probably did n't spend much time playing the game . And if someone says they 'll never buy anything from this developer in future there may be more to the story than the game play .	1
This is a pretty interesting puzzle game . It 's a mix of a lot of things to keep you preoccupied . It 's a bit like scrabble , where you are given a set of letters to make words in order to 'defend yourself ' after you have been attacked by mice , skeletons , etc . You face these beings in dungeons , and these dungeons are shown on a World Map . The map shows where you are , and how many dungeons you will have to go through ( which are a lot ) .You are able to choose your own game mode , and these are your options : Kid Mode - starts with extra health , words do double damageNormal - Standard RulesWizard - Experts only ! Starts on Dungeon 4 . No oracle tilesYou really have to get creative with the words , for you can not use the same word twice ( it seems ever ) , so I can see this being a perfect game for a person really into puzzles.For me personally it was a pretty good game , but I do n't think I would get through the entire map in one sitting . It 's definitely something for me to check into every once and a while when I 'm bored , because it is a challenging game , it 's just a tad redundant.However , once you amass a certain amount of points there are extra squares you are given that have powers that play to your advantage ( like a healing one , extra points , oracle eye that creates the best word out of all your letters , etc etc ) .But I love the added paranormal-ish element to it - it 's not just a regular word game . There are probably added features that I have n't gotten to ( I 'm on the fifth dungeon right now ) , so I ca n't wait to see what else is offered . I also appreciate that there are different modes , so you can practice a little and receive hints on how to play in the kid mode before attempting the normal or wizard modes .	1
You see many new word games coming out nowadays but this has its own unique twist to it which I like . It plays kind of like Wizardry but mixed with scramble . Very challenging , nice looking at something different . Works flawlessly on my DROID razr	1
what a fun game . using your word and anagrams skills to fight monsters . you ca n't use the same word within a dungeon but you can use it again in the next dungeon . using different forms of a word helps . the bigger the word the better but do n't waste a good word on a little monster . the special tiles are key to fighting the more powerful monsters . I went thru the normal made with no problems . gon na try the higher level now . good fun !	1
I like this word game because it has a different twist to it . I actually worked a little harder to find longer words which I was able to do . So far I have only made it to level 8 and when you make it this far you are occasionally given a cool book of lore which gives you a choice between two rewards . It does seem to get challenging in a hurry , but that is okay with me because it last about the right amount of time for playing . I am happy that it closes when you exit the game . Also I thought the game gave enough vowels and appropriate consonants to actually be able to spell words . I feel intrigued enough to want to keep playing . Highly recommend .	1
scrabble with an interesting rpg twist ... enjoying it so far.. not a five star..graphics could have been a bit better but all in all..not a bad game..would recommend this for word game enthusiasts .	1
If you like games such as Scrabble or Words With Friends , then you 'll most likely like this one . It is similar , with an RPG twist added to it . The bonus tiles make it more interesting as you 're battling the monsters . My only complaint is that it 's too short !	1
This game makes you think plus it 's extra fun with the RPG element . It 's easy enough to understand the mechanics just to pick up and play .	1
This is a good mix between a word game and a fantasy rpg . The magic tiles are a good touch . The items found in the dungeons can not be used , but they are quirky and funny and are a nice touch to the game as well .	1
This reminds me of the dungeon computer games that I played as a kid , with the added twist of word puzzles . Great game for adults and children .	1
Even my wife , who plays very few games finds herself addicted to this game . Would recommend it to anyone , helps you remember your vocabulary .	1
The game is fun until you get halfway through it and get a set of letters with no vowels so that you ca n't even make a word . When this happens , you can only sit there helplessly and watch yourself lose . I 'd rather lose based on my own abilities not because the randomness of the game left me without any ability to continue . Fix this and you 'll get your fifth star . May I suggest some sort of scramble option , even if it cost you points or abilities or something ? May I also suggest code that makes absolutely sure there are 1 or 2 vowels in the letters at all times ? Thank you !	1
I ca n't imagine how this got a bad review . For only a 3.99 this is a great way to record songs and ideas if you are young & amp ; clueless in the world of music . It 's easy and does a lot . I am enjoying it and certainly do n't regret buying it .	1
I like how you could choose different songs and can play with this on my Samsung Galaxy III . I would recommend it .	1
stuck in a place sitting , sitting , waiting ... , i can listen to my books now . Clear crisp , just what i want to listen to.keeps me from going crazy !	1
I 've been an audible member for some time now . This app works perfectly . No problems whatsoever . I was so happy to learn I could add Audible to my android tablet . They have a huge selection , with new items added constantly . The best part is they have sales all the time , so they do n't make a huge dent in your wallet .	1
i must say i did n't think i would like listening to books as the commercial says `` my grandmother listens to books '' but it turns out to be a wonderful thing you can listen before bed with out using the light that keeps you up . you can listen in the shower or at the gym i am so happy i decided to try it	1
I have a whole backlog of books in my audible account . This is the way I now access them whenever I am ready to listen to one . You have access to your entire library and can just download whichever one you want to listen to now . This is much easier than getting it from the website on your desktop or laptop and then having to move it over to your mobile device .	1
I 've had an account with Audible since ... well..a couple of months after they opened shop . Back then , it was easier and cheaper to convert the books to CD than to get an MP3 player with enough capacity to hold a whole book . But that 's a whole other story.Pretty much , I love the app . It syncs up just fine , loading in all the books in my library that I have bought over the years . I can shop directly from the app , so I can grab a new title while on the road . I like that I can start listening even before a book download is completed , especially given the size of some of them . The app offers several sorting methods , plays just fine in the background , and I have yet to have it crash on me . The color scheme works well , easy to read . The 30 second reverse button is handy , especially if a loud vehicle or some other distraction comes along and drowns out the sound . When calls come in , it pauses nicely and resumes when I end the call.There are two things I do n't care for however , which is why the app only gets four stars instead of 5 . One is that it does n't seem to always remember what it was doing last . If I pause the playback , exit the app , then come back , it may and may not remember what it was doing at the time . When it does n't remember , it puts me back at the main library menu , leaving me to scroll back to the book and part that I was listening to . It always remembers where in the book/part I left off at least . The second thing is the interaction when I get a notification . The notification tone overrides the app , causing me to miss whatever was said for the duration of the tone . ( That 's another point where the 30 second reverse button is handy . ) While I do n't have long notification sounds , someone who does will miss quite a bit .	1
This is my primary interface for Audible . I do most of my buying of Audible files through this app and hardly ever go to the website . It is very convenient to have all of the files here on my phone that I carry around with me all the time . I listen to books while doing other things so not having a double speed is n't important to me .	1
First off - this requires a Audible.com account to use . If you do n't like Audible.com then this app is n't for you . The App for Audible is perfect for keeping up on books while I 'm on the go . I listen to books while I drive , do dishes , sweep out the garage.Features : You can add bookmarks where you 're listening so you never loose your place . These bookmarks sync to your account so you can pick up on your Kindle and then pick right back up on your phone . It 's also good for when you switch to a more exciting book and do n't want to start over ( guilty ) . Narrator speed is great too . I do n't know how it does it , but I listen to my book at 1.5x the speed and the narrators voice does n't get any higher - just faster . I once listened to an audio book at a higher speed on another app , and it sounded like Peewee Herman was my narrator . I also like that I can delete and add books right from that app so I only download what I want on my devices at that time since my entire library of purchases is in the cloud ready for download .	1
I love audible . The selection of stories they have available is astounding . They also give great freebies and promotinal books !	1
I love this app and use it daily . I love the seamless downloading and having my entire library at my fingertips . Sound quality is great . My only issue is that every now and again the widget freezes , but beyond that the program works to my satisfaction .	1
I love this app . It offers a wide variety of audio books . I use it a lot at night when in bed . I haven & apos ; t had any problems with it so far . My only complaint is that it didn & apos ; t shut off , I have to force stop it . If nit for that I would give it five stars .	1
I love it ! ! ! ! ! ! I 'm 13 year 's old and I love to read and this app is purfect for me thank u amazon ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! : ) : ) : ) : )	1
I have some eye troubles and this is so great to have my Bible etc . read out loud to me along with other books on my Kindle .	1
When this app became available for Android I gave away my iPod nano . It is unbelievably convenient to download books directly whenever you want them ! No mucking with awful iTunes . I 've been with Audible for nearly ten years now and this app is far and away the best listening experience I 've ever used with the service.Audible itself is wonderful . You can read in so many places it 's impossible to take a book . A good book makes your workout or commute fly by ! It 's a little weird at first -- having books read to you -- but if you stick with it , you 'll quickly come to love Audible too .	1
Works well on my Mac and have had no problems with it . Happy I choose to download it . I would recommend it if you buy audible books	1
Good app. , to have if you love to read . Its a little pricey , there is a monthly fee , but if you like to listen to good books this is the app . for you . Customer service is very good .	1
I like this app because I can take my book with me wherever I go so that I always can keep up with my reading and I 'm never without something to do !	1
I put this on my phone and listened to two novels and am on my third so far . A great alternative to listening to music .	1
We listened to an entire book while driving from one state to another on a road trip . This app worked flawlessly and kept our place when we paused and resumed . ( no kids in the car )	1
Very good app for downloading and listening to Audible purchases . It 's easy to find what has already been downloaded to my Fire and what I have n't downloaded . If I 'm on wireless I can download new content from Audible.There 's no need for this app on the latest Fire HD . I use this on my First Generation Fire . Unfortunately if you have a First Generation , Amazon stopped supporting it with software upgrades a while back so the latest and greatest will not come your way .	1
This app does not have the same features as my other audio book apps , but it 's manageable . It 's also better than having your Kindle read toyou . I like OneCick Audio better .	1
my eyes have been going down hill for some time and i dont get the enjoyment of reading as often as i would like.. this program gives me the option on hearing my book on my tablet , i also find that i can listen whilke cleaning or walking it is a must have and a keeper	1
My hubby loves this app , he uses it everyday . And I have to ask for my iPad back from him now .	1
Got this for the free trial . Wanted some old time radio to listen to . ( this was before I had a constant wifi signal at work . ) Content downloaded easy . good to listen to .	1
track my purchasessometimes buy things when I 'm on the roadeasy to useeasy to navigatevery good app	1
This app is a decent way to navigate Amazon without having to open a browser . It 's a bit more difficult to filter the results than on a page , or but the application is a bit easier to use . They have struck an excellent balance between simplicity and utility .	1
The access is the same at first it stated it would not work on my tablet , I went to the amazon apps . I downloaded from there site , it works fine . I am able to get in my account , buy items . This app makes shopping easy.If you shop amazon this app is a must have . I am very happy with it .	1
I really like this app . If you know what you want , search and buy . You can even track your orders . The only reason 4/5 stars is because missing ( a ) sort by price ( b ) needs input field to apply promos . Otherwise if you shop on Amazon , this is must have app .	1
Do n't know what I would do if I could not download books , games , supplies , etc . One minute you are wishing and the next , there it is in front of you ! Amazon is honorable in their business ethics . No problem too big or too small to solve . I love to work with them and do almost all transactions through Amazon !	1
This app is simple . It is very easy to use . This is a quick and easy way to use amazon and also less complicated .	1
It is so easy to purchase things on Amazon . There are so many items available . It a site that I will return to many times	1
Makes it quick and easy to buy what I need via my phone or tablet . I like the convenience of this .	1
Very good for keeping up to date on things of interest and pricing changes . Have had good luck with all phones used on .	1
This app allows you to shop quicker on Amazon.com without having to go to a browser and search it . I highly recommend this app to those who shop on Amazon.com because you 'll do it in a much better and quicker way . I give this app 5 stars .	1
This app makes a lot of things work on my android . I did n't realize how much it affected until I accidently uninstalled it . I reinstalled and it 's been easy sailing again . Very handy , gives a lot of great options , most are free !	1
This app lets you shop on amazon as well on your mobile device as you do on your pc . It is an awesome app .	1
I got this to see if it was easier to use then the browser and sure enough , it is . Once I got myself logged in it feels just like I wanted it to . The check your cart button is my favorite and it is right at the top of the screen so I can see if prices have changed . I use this on my android and have not had any troubles with it at all , well done app .	1
Works great on my Nexus 7 . I use it to check stuff out on Amazon all the time . Have placed several orders with it and had no problems at all .	1
Anyone with an Amazon account has to have this app for their smartphone . I keep track of orders , delivery status and shop on my phone . This is one of my favorite apps , and it was free	1
How quick can you get to your app and look around for what you want ! ! Get it you will absolutely like it ! ! !	1
I make purchase from Amazon all the time so if you do too from your Android you will love it also .	1
I wish review people would stop making it mandatory for us to write something , maybe we just want to give it a good star rating and go about our day . Crazily enough some of us may be too busy to fill out some long review about an app for our phone or tablet . That 's not to say its not a good app but I 'm just saying requiring us to type something seems like a dick move , maybe you 'll consider changing it or maybe I 'm just blowing smoke but more often then not I opt to not do reviews because I do n't feel I should be required to type anything . Thanks for the app .	1
I use Amazon almost daily ! I love it ! I rarely have any problems . I would and have recommended this app along with Amazon many times .	1
I love the convenience of shopping from my phone . Unfortunately , I use multiple wishlists on my account , and this application only allows the user to add items to the default wishlist . To get around this , I have to add items as I find them , and then go in on my computer later and move them to the proper wishlist.Aside from that small frustration , it definitely makes shopping a little too convenient ( if you know what I mean ) .	1
I love just having alternative choices on my android phone . Not always having to use the android app store . It works great on my Motorola Atrix . I love how they have a free paid app every day . I check in everyday just to see if there 's one I 'd like to download	1
Very easy to use app , makes ordering something on the fly easy , recommended to anyone that uses Amazon	1
This mobile app is great for comparing prices at the store or just buying something on the go when you ca n't get to your computer .	1
This is great to easly look items up on the go . It 's easy to use and has most of the functionality on the website.GET IT !	1
I find this app awesome as it has pretty much the website rolled into an app to use when the internet browser dose n't work ( meaning that the internet still works but the internet server dose n't work ) .	1
Its Amazon ! On a phone ! Seriously , my mind is blown.More seriously , I enjoy using this application then the full blown website . It allows me quick tracking to all my packages . The descriptions says it all .	1
love how easy this is to use I would like to see more actions like updating addresses on existing orders . still love it keeps it simple and can quickly purchase items with no hassle .	1
Clearly I enjoy Amazon , why not get the app ? That way you can spend all your money all the time on your phone , not just while at home on your PC !	1
I VIEW TECHNOLOGY WITH A JAUNDICED EYE . ON THE ONE HAND , WHAT CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE AT THE TOUCH OF A FINGER IS AMAZING . THIS APP PROVIDES JUST WHAT I NEED WHEN I NEED IT . HOWEVER , I HAVE LEARNED TO KEEP MY WANTS AND NEEDS SEPARATED AND HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN NOT BECOMING A JUNK JUNKIE . CONTROLLING THE LUSTS OF THE FLESH REQUIRES WISDOM AND COMMON SENSE . IF YOU HAVE BOTH OF THESE , THIS APP WORKS WELL ... IF YOU HAVE NEITHER , AND YOUR CREDIT CARD DEBT IS BEYOND REASON , PAY YOUR BILLS , THEN GET THE APP .	1
I use this alot while shopping at other stores - I will check to see if Amazon has it for about the same or less ( usually its less ) and then I just order it and wait the two days ( I have prime ) for it to arrive . Sometimes I will see an item but it makes me think of something else I need that the store I 'm in does not carry - so I check Amazon . I even impressed my boss while she was doing a supply order for our office and I told her she could get the item cheaper through Amazon ( ink ) and then pulled out my phone and showed her . Got a bonus for it !	1
I am so thankful for the smartphones we have on the market today , for if there were no smartphones , there would be no Amazon Mobile app . That said , I have this app on all 3 of my devices , my Samsung Galaxy SII Epic Touch 4G/D710 , my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7 '' tablet , and my Asus TF300T Transformer 10 '' tablet , its one of those apps that you never knew how you lived without it . For me , when ever I am out and about , and I may per chance find something I am looking for . Well now , I just bring up my Amazon Mobile app , being as the app will work on 3/4G and/or WiFi , I 'm never without my trusty Amazon Mobile app . I can open open the app , log on , search for whatever it is I 'm drooling over at the time , if I can get it cheaper on Amazon , and chances are I will , if it is something I absolutely have to have , I can order it on the spot , and have it in my hands in a matter of days.If you are on the go , or out and about , if you are anything at all like I am , and this goes for you guys , tools , yea Amazon has ALL kinds of tools , electronic gizmos and gadgets , which I 'm a sucker for , Amazon has all kinds of electronics too . Now you do n't need to be on your home computer to satisfy those impulse purchases , or that late night gift for your wife or girlfriend . You can do it all from the comfort of your smartphone .	1
How could I live without this app ? If you need to find apps . for your tablet this is the way to go ! It 's simple to use finds what your looking for in a heart beat . This is the one I use the most . I can even use it to purchase apps . or products while moving about the house or any place I have3 a WiFi connection . ( mine is not a phone , just a 4 & # 34 ; internet tablet ) The only problem I ever have with it is , I loose my connection . This is no fault of the Amazon application . I highly recommend this App . AMAZON MOBILE . Semper Fidelis	1
What can you say . It 's Amazon and you know they will make the best possible app to help you shop . Easy to use . It configures and sync 's your account . Start shopping !	1
this is it absolutely must have application .when you 're looking to buy something amazon has virtually everything you were looking for the Apple OS quickly and efficiently and you could even do one stop 1 click shopping Amazon makes it so easy its got me hooked I 'm a customer for life.keep up the good work .	1
I really like this app because I can shop online with my tablet at anytime I want . I do a lot of my shopping with amazon ; I can trust I will be treated honestly	1
This is much easier to use than trying to get Amazon on the web on your cell phone . I do n't use it too often , but it works well when I do !	1
Works adequately on the smaller smartphone screen if you do n't have access to a larger screen of a tablet or regular computer . I felt there were design and functional compromises to make it all fit	1
great app.easy to use and very & # 34 ; user friendly & # 34 ; Would recommend this app . to all amazon users.Functional and efficient	1
I downloaded this app for my smartphone and linked it with my Amazon acct . It works flawlessly ! ! I can now shop Amazon from my mobile phone ! !	1
What else is there to say - it 's an Amazon App store app that allows you to browse or search the Amazon App Store direct from your Android device . I 've had no problems using the app on my tablet . The only improvement I could suggest is a delete feature , for those daily free apps I tried but no longer want to keep . After deleting them from my tablet , the app notifies me they 're available to upgrade/reinstall and wo n't let me purge the list of unwanted apps .	1
What ? You did not know Amazon has everything . Use this web site for almost everything i can buy if I can wait for shipping . I only buy elsewhere when I need it the same day .	1
This is a great app for amazoniacs like myself . I love having mobile access to my favorite shopping website . I coupled this app with a scanner app and use it to find better deals online . In this economy , saving money is huge . I appreciate that this app makes it easier !	1
I love this app because I can access Amazon anytime I want it . I 've looked up items during lunch out or while shopping . It 's very helpful to be able to compare items and prices .	1
Of course its great . Amazon app is needed to shop with any device . Works as an app should . Nuff said .	1
This is a good program for android it 's stable and safe way to shop Amazon for just about anything you need	1
Seems to work just fine . Good strong signal , plenty of volume . Finding the agencies you want to listen to is controlled by a simple search .	1
This is an excellent application that delivers what it promises ... as long as dedicated amateurs have one of their radios tuned to provide the sources it feeds.While some people might find listening to emergency services radios voyeuristic or creepy : as somebody who spends far more time each day in a car trying to get to and from work , this app offers -- at least where I live -- true value added.My daily commute takes place between two major metropolitan areas , in an area that mostly is overlooked during drive-time traffic reporting . The police/fire feed for the county where that 90 % of my daily commuting occurs provides valuable early warning about incidents on roads that traffic reporters would be telling me about far too late ... if at all.Easy to use ; search by name , genre or location , or search for any audio within a radius near you . Rock solid functionality on anHTC Evo 4gVery few differences between this and thefree version . Paid version drops ads , and adds a pause/play button that is persistent between sessions ( and you can run the free and paid version at the same time to follow two programming sources ) .	1
Very cool app . Easy to use and nice layout . Very well put together . Provides many areas to check out . Thanks . Kindle Fire	1
Love this one.Very cool , you could listen to it all day and into the night.Oneof the many features is that you can literally listen to any band in the world.I have relatives living in the states and a broad and be able to dial into their towns and hear not only police traffic but also their weather.Just another great feature is going to the browse section , it will tell you if anything major is happening in a city that is going on.To many features to list , just sit back and enjoy playing with the scanner .	1
It turns out there is less crime in my area then I thought . The channel for my area only something when some thing is being radioed in , which makes sense .	1
If you like listening to police scanners this is the app for you . Most counties in the country have someone who is feeding scanners to their server . You can listen to any of them that are online . You can add favorites and go to them whenever you want . Listen to your county , city of your choice , or county in another state .	1
It 's a very good scanner program and is very easy to use and understand and works great on my Kindle Fire HD . I only have one disappointment about it . I live out in the country and about 40 miles or so from our County Sheriffs Office and the county I live in is not listed . So , I have to set it for the large city that 's about 30 miles away and not in the County in which I live . We have no local Police Department and our local volenteer volunteer fire department is not listed in it either .	1
This is really great ! ! ! I do n't know how it works , but picking any police , fire or rescue in the country is awesome .	1
Really enjoy this app ; far better than the free version which is loaded with advertising and limited functionality . Very good app which I listen to quite frequently - I give it a strong recommendation !	1
I was looking for an app to use as a scanner and while the free version on this app is fine the PRO version is finer . I use the things one puts on the home screen to listen to both police and fire but I have to manually switch between the two . I wonder if we could choose our favorites and then have the app & # 34 ; scan & # 34 ; each of them ? I know it must be possible , it 's in the name , but I have n't figured out how it can be done . Also I worry that the source website counts on it 's users to provide content and you know how fragile that can be . I mean people are fallible and at the most critical times they may just forget to turn on their home scanners . Then what do we do ?	1
It 's a good idea , and it 's fun to listen in on police and fire scanners around the country . Just wish the scanners in my town were not encrypted ... could not hear anything for my town : (	1
You can listen to all the radio calls from all over the world police and fire and others great to listen	1
I love this app so much I purchased I to support the app . Note it only works if someone streams in your area . Get the free version first to check what 's available .	1
So long as you have access to wireless Internet , nothing is out of range . Good variety of areas covered , even in rural parts of the country ( I live in rural Iowa and get my county ) .	1
Works as expected . I like the enhancements . It will aleart you when a station is getting a lot of traffic . It has a lot of coverage but more is always better .	1
I love this . I like the full range i get and use it a lot . I recommend this to anyone who likes to know what is happening in their area	1
Lots of fun . Some of the stations are kinda low in volume . But all and all , pretty good for entertainment .	1
as a former armed security officer in Flint MI . a scanner was always handy but sometimes a full size one was n't an option , I could listen to this with a single ear bud and no one knew	1
Probably the most used app on my phone ! Good reminder & snooze options.. Easy to use ! You can visit the history as well !	1
This is finally *the* reminder app I was looking for . COL Reminder is *awesome* . I 'll be watching for other apps by this designer & amp ; recommending this to all . Will be happy to upgrade soon to a paid version . It works , gives notifications on Kindle Fire even in sleep mode , has clean , easy , intelligent interface & amp ; look/feel , is easily manageable/controllable/customizable , carefree , deoendable ... do not know what I 'd do without it , every day !	1
very cool game . I play it all the time on my kindle.fire . this is a fabulous app . great boredom buster . my only critique is that its a little bit slow . maybe that 's just my device . overall I thought it was pretty cool .	1
I have always loved the checkers . I have since my granddaddy taught me when I was little . Now every time I play it , I think about him and smile .	1
Perfect game . Best part it 's free ! I have found no flaws in this app an I find it a challenge . I gave it 5 stars .	1
Its checkers ... . not too many ways that it can be messed up . Its free so that 's even better . I 've seen one star posts complaining that its glitchy , well you know what , smart phones are glitchy , apps are glitchy , even paid apps . So 5 stars for this little gem ; its fun , entertaining ad I like the undo function .	1
When u start to play it is not all of these passwords everywhere and Facenook & amp ; Username stuff . All u have to do is put your name . U even get to choose ur own level for beginners and people who r so good at chess ! Buy this app !	1
Fun and relaxing game . The screen freezes upon occasion , but I can not complain when the game is free to play . Reminds me of playing my grandmother as a child . Thank you !	1
I enjoy CHECKERS . I mostly play against the 'built in ' opponent , and I have to admit I have n't won a game yet ! It is easy to operate and set up for a live opponent and you could spend a lot of time enjoying the game . I would recommend this game if you are fan of checker games to begin with . P.S . I also was defeated by my young grandson ! ! !	1
Bought these songs and apps for my Kindle Fire before switching to the iPad ... . Good stuff at the time though !	1
This was fun . If you like checkers then this is the app for you . No problems . Nice free app to have .	1
A good learning app on how to play the game . Can be set to different skill levels and that a plus . Factor in the we have not had technical issues with this app and therefore I give it 4 stars .	1
My husband loves checkers , but he 's always played with a board and pieces ( and has always beat me ) . One bored Sunday , I downloaded this to my Kindle and introduced him to the wonders of technology . Well , he still beat me , but he did admit he liked playing this way . It 's a great game , easy on the eyes and the ads were n't so bad as to get in the way .	1
lots options and levels of play . fun way to improve your game too . you 'll enjoy this app . es to see and understand .	1
its an good classic board game & amp ; its very easy . but its hard too so idk it is good though I guess	1
I absolutely LOVE checkers ! ! I do n't know what else to say . It is absolutely awesome and I play it all the time . Easy to beat it .	1
So i thought i ws pretty good at checkers until i played here against the computer ... lol ... it kicked my butt ! So I 'm watching the moves it makes to improve my craft ... i lk tht it has a slider button to move for easy to hard ...	1
Fun game to pass time . If you are a checkers lover you will enjoy this ... tough too ! ! ! I love the challenge !	1
The app works well , there was no glitches , and the game did NOT crash at all . Its fun and so basic that everyone can play it !	1
kids love to play games perfect for them and they can take turns so no one is upset while the other waits	1
A simple game , but the exexcution is exactly what you would expect . No issues that I 've seen , and you ca n't beat a price tag of & quot ; free. & quot ;	1
The only thing is , I wish winning were more possible at the hardest level . It is possible to get a draw . Challenging and fun - and I will keep trying to win . Poe once wrote something about checkers being a better game than chess , and he may have been right . Since this is a free app , you will lose nothing and you will gain a fascinating pastime by downloading it .	1
vVry basic checkers and decent app ... It works for me ... It does offer an upgrade version but I have n't tried itEDIT : After playing it more , I find that the game seems to freeze upon my Kindle Fire from time to time , especially if you miss clicking `` yes '' on the double jump option . This verision also does not force a jump , if a jump is available .	1
When people play it it 's so AMAZING ! I think it is popular then any other apps ! So , go to the app store and buy it ! I hope you enjoy it !	1
This game is a lot of fun . You can play with two players or with the computer . You can chose the . difficulty level of the computer . I highly recommend getting this app .	1
I enjoy checkers . This game is great because if you ca n't find anyone else to play you can play the computer to better your skills .	1
fun ... ..but glitchy.when you want to double jump you have to wait until it says & quot ; do you want to make an additional jump & quot ; and if you do click on the space you want to jump it stops and you have to go back to the menu screen	1
I have been having fun learning to play a strategic game of checkers . Gives you ideas and help when you do the settings . Easy to get started and you keep going back . Like how you can play with the computer or against someone .	1
What can I say ? It is checkers . The games offers options regarding who goes first and difficulty level making this game appropriate for all ages and skill levels . The program only locked up on me once but I have only been using it a couple of days .	1
I 've always enjoyed playing checkers . I learned as a kid and enjoyed it ever since . I love the fact that I can make it a bit more difficult for more of a challenge . Like their chess app , the graphics are great . Great design ! Only drawback for me is the fact that there is no flying kings option . Even so , well worth your time .	1
This is a great version of checkers . My grandaughter , who recently learned to play on a board , does well with it .	1
varied levels of difficulty . and can be played by only one player.great game for the entire family.I would recommend it !	1
Good app for the price . Works as expected without any problems . I am happy with the performance on the kindle fire .	1
Good game to have on hand to play with the grandkids or the big kids ( parents of the grandchildren ) . Can never go wrong with having a checkers game ( esp . free ) in your game closest .	1
I like this developer of free , traditional board games . I especially like the two player feature so I can play against my kid , or against the computer .	1
CheckersIt was also free I Just love playing games but the computer seems to win more than I do	1
Installs and plays fine . I dinged it a star as there is no exit option -- also could not find an easy way to save unfinished games ... may not be possible .	1
Checkers is a simnple strategy game and this AP makes playing the game as simple and easy as the real thing . You can play against the computer or a real opponent . It functions like real checkers in that once you reach your ponents back row your checker becomes a king and can move in all directions . The board and checkers are attractive and game play is simple and easy . If you 're a checker fan , you 'll enjoy this AP .	1
Its great to see the many ways to play this game..You can either jump someone or not..But in any case whether playing alone against the computer or with another person , I have always been very good at checkers , learning at a young age..I love it..	1
This app is easy to use , fun , and you get a choice 1-10 on how hard the compute player is , or you can play two player .	1
Excellent little app for killing time while waiting in line at the bank , or in the doctors office waiting room . My only complaint is that the text window that pops up for doing multiple jumps is a bit tiny on my 7 & # 34 ; Kindle Fire HD . I imagine this is n't such an issue on the larger Kindles however .	1
it os awesome never had so much fun playing Chelsea against a computer ! ! If you do n't like this app something is weird about your brain ! ! !	1
Me and my kids love to play all the time . I recommend this to anyone , it 's not hard to play	1
I have yet to win against the machine ! I love checkers though & I am determined to beat this thing ! Lots of fun !	1
its a basic app and simple did n't take long to get users to it . I regimens it to anybody who likes checkers .	1
checkers free is the best checkers app I have seen . You can play multiplayer and dingle player . You can change the level difficulty from . super easy to expert .	1
This traditional board game is presented extremely well in this e-format . It downloaded and functions easily on both my Kindle Fire and my iPhone . I enjoy the game and the challenge . Thank you for board games known to and apppreciated by older adults . Great game !	1
This is another game I use to pass the time.Its really all I use it for . I like this game . Thanks	1
Checkers is a strategy based game so it can help to train your brain or just pass the time.Play against a computer and you 'll never know what the next move will be . Love the adjustable difficulty settings . Play any time . Get app .	1
The computer beats me , but playing with others is fun . A good travel game for adults as well as children .	1
you can control over how the computer plays . good way to play checkers . worth playing if you like checkers . play and looks great on the kindle fire .	1
A fun game . Easy setting I can beat every time but difficult setting I lose 75 % of the time . Hoping that will help me improve ovr time .	1
this game is super fun I really like it on by kindle fire it works great its fun and enrtaning	1
Checkers is a very competitive , fun game to play against your siblings . Me and my sister play all the time and we have tons of fun .	1
My five year old has me playing this for hours at a time.. The only reason it did n't get five stars.. it freezes , towards the last few moves and you have to cancel your game to get it to work again	1
it 's so easy to play and you can adjust the level of difficultly depending on good you are against the game . Unfortunately I can not brag about being good cause I 'm playing at the lowest level and getting skunked at the same time . Grrrrrr !	1
This game is fun . Just like real checkers . My little brother and I play it together , but you can also choose to play by yourself . I DO N'T think that , because it is free , it 's not very good . I think that if you get the free version you do n't have to get the full version . It 's just THAT good	1
Just the basic checkers game but it is fun and can play with a friend . Good time waster and worth getting since its a free game and everyone plays checkers !	1
Challenging and fun . I like this game on Kindle Fire . I also like that it has AI and I can play against a computer .	1
This game is great . It is very hard to win in this game , however , I have n't given up . I would recommend this game to anyone that likes to be challenged .	1
The game is good but sometimes it will freeze my screen in the middle of a match . This app is on my kindle fire and works most of the time . I would have given it 5 stars but since it freezes my screen sometimes you guys loose a star .	1
I must have played this game a hundred times and I 'm ashamed how many times I 've lost . But I am getting better if I can beat the computer a real person should be cake .	1
A King is suppose to be able to jump from one side to the other side . That 's why it 's a King.The King has no more power than a regular checker .	1
Pac-man to the extreme ! Graphics are very colorful . Cool music . Clever game . Challenging but not frustrating . Needs more levels ! ! ! ! Best app of the day ever !	1
Many developers over the years haved tried time and time again to re-make the classic Pac-Man but have each time FAILED MISERBLY . But this game is the exception to that . Hexage has combined wonderful graphics with a classic game but with a new concept . You collect the little squares for points but get help along the way from a cute might I add old yellow square . Beware of the red squares because in this revamp there are more then four pesky little & quot ; ghosts & quot ; .	1
Somebody take my device away - this game is so very addicting ! Worth the nominal fee , EVAC HD is engaging , easy to learn , and will look beautiful on your smartphone or tablet . Be sure to tell your friends - EVAC HD is the game to download today !	1
I LOVE THIS GAME ! ! ! ! ! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT ! ! ! ! YOU MIGHT THINK THIS LOOKS WEIRD BUT ITS NOT . I THINK ITS WORTH MORE THAN WHAT THIS SAYS ... .	1
This game is like a new , modern version of Pac-man , just without turning the ghosts blue . The game is a little more maze-like than Pac-Man and you have to think sometimes in order to solve certain puzzles . The graphics are decent but the sound got annoying in a hurry . Make sure to turn off that music ! I did find this challenging enough to want to keep playing for a while.While it is pretty fun , but I found myself frustrated with the controls as I would try to be going a certain direction but my finger had slid too far away from the control area and I would stop moving altogether . Or fitting in some tighter spots can be a little difficult . I did get better with practice , but I kept getting frustrated by them .	1
pacman on roids . wish the controls were a touch better . could be my fat fingers though . most d pad type games are hard for me on a touch screen .	1
it a really good app , almost beats pac man . the controls are fine on my KINDLE FIRE . got to level 7 no problems .	1
very good , square pacman meets bad boxes , traps and spikes . makes you think and gets your thumb tired real quick . still trying to 3M on it . why do I keep trying ?	1
this game is a great puzzle game the game is played out in squares and you van move around trying to escape the shareholder looking box in the picture . you are able to push boxes and you friend in the game and use them to your advantage wearer its weighing down switches or trapping enemy 's this game is great . watch out for spikes though !	1
thought try this game out here and I 'm not personally one that likes games . played just a little but this played fine and cool little game I thought . I 'll probably delete soon but like I said I do n't enjoy games really ... but this is n't bad . looks great on galaxy S3 big screen : - )	1
Get this game ! Its better than Pac-Man , with a story , powers , colorful levels , good for all ages , recommended ! It would probably be especially good on a tablet	1
Checkers is almost too addicting.It makes time go by like a snap.I love checkers in real life but we do n't have it in my house.So yeah , ADDICTION ! ! : )	1
LOVED IT . its definetly the best game ever . better than Angry BirdsI could n't stop playing it . The only comments I bane are good ones	1
This is the only dictionary app I have used . It works just fine . Fine enough I have never even tried to find a different dictionary app .	1
This is a wonderful and useful application . It has helped me remember old words as well as expanding my vocabulary . I especially enjoy the pronunciation portion . I only wish it had a section for different languages .	1
This is a great app to have on hand for quick references when you need them . It is also very easy to use and I like that it is part of the mPoints program .	1
I have had a dictionary.com app for years on several devices . Love the word of the day and with the addition of mpoints to earn just for doing what I already do is great !	1
Ok app for free but my favorite is the m points app that comes with it . You can do somethings without internet but not much . It is ok for free .	1
I love it . You can use it daily . I learned a lot and it is so easy to use . Great to increase your vocabulary .	1
I really like this app . I 've had it on my phone and now it 's very convenient to have it on my kindle .	1
Works well on Vibrant with Froyo.\n\nEtymology is not as exrensive as on the site . Wish it was either expanded or that you could click to go to the entry on the main site .	1
This app is really good ! I love it ! It is awesome ! I use it so much ! AWESOME app ! Download it !	1
I have used this app many times , on all my android devices and find it very useful . Whenever I need to spell a word for my kids , I ask Dictionary.com .	1
I do a lot of reading , but I still run across 'new ' words all the time . This app is the answer .	1
I like to read a lot of kindle books and this really helps to look up a word I do n't know .	1
I originally downloaded it for the mpoints , but it turned out to be quite informative and useful . It 's a Great app	1
It makes it easy to look up words ... ..and I love the words of the day and best of all it 's free	1
Anyone who has trouble spelling ... well , almost anything , and is tired of the limited suggestions of built in dictionaries will love this . If you can even get into the zip code this will & # 34 ; suggest & # 34 ; a group of words where you 'll probably find yours . And that 's just the dictionary . The thesaurus is flat slammin ' . I 've had to use the dictionary just to figure out what some of the alternative words meant ! Wonderful !	1
Obviously not for everyone , but if you like having a dictionary and Thesaurus at your fingertips , this one is good and easy to use .	1
One of the best apps for a Dictionary . It has everything you need to complete your projects.Glad to have it .	1
This is one of the most useful apps on my phone . While it needs a data connection to retrieve the definitions , it is faster in my opinion than searching for the same thing through your phone 's browser . Additionally , the app can provide audible pronunciations and a thesaurus ( without requiring a separate program ) . This is essential to any student , but is also convenient for anyone who wants or needs access to a dictionary on the go ! Runs smoothly on my Droid 2 Global w/ Froyo ( Android 2.2 ) .	1
Great reference book for anyone . Will help any one with any of their word problems . I recommend this book . You will use it a lot .	1
Have n't had much of a chance to use this app yet . I am looking forward to using it and I do hope it will be helpful .	1
I have found this app to be very useful in a number of ways , from simple dictionary inquiries to providing voice pronunciations .	1
This is a good dictionary for kindle and I 'll keep it . It provides a more complete list of words than other dictionary apps .	1
My go to when I am struggling to write and need reassurance that I am thinking of the right word or spelling it correct .	1
This has it all in one place . Best of all , it is free and you can not beat free AND features .	1
It is a good app otherwise . I have n't had occasion to use the thesaurus , so I can not rate it at this time .	1
I love everything about this app . I have had it for about nine months now and really like that it is so easy to use ! I speak the word and there it is before me , took a bit for me to learn how to speak properly but then I am the evolved one here with the opposing thumbs . Simplicity at its best ! And the price is way right : - )	1
This is quite comprehensive with origins of some words , too . Easy to useMy Kindle has great and quick word references , by just holding down the wordI want . But this is fine for writing . And crossword puzzles .	1
I love this app ! it is so cool you do n't even have to look in a dictionary book all you have to do is pick . up your kindle and type in the word and there you go	1
This is my favorite online dictionary . I have it pinned to my start menu for easy access.If I need to define a word while reading something I do n't have to stop to look for the dictionary.A real plus is that I can get the correct pronunciation for a word that I 'm not familiar with .	1
like how its so simple ! ! can look up and has thesaurus also . will get lots of use out of this app .	1
This is a great app . I can look up any word with thorough information to the word . I also enjoy my help on points . I love this app .	1
How many time does someone use a word you do n't know . This is a really easy app to use plus has some really cool features on it .	1
Maybe its this generation but its so much easier to go to the app then find a real dictionary . Not to mention this goes with you anywhere without adding 5lbs . Love the thesaurus also , comes in handy since I do a lot of puzzles . Even as an adult you are always comming across new words so having it speak the word is a nice feature . And granted I do n't look at the word of the day every day I think its another great feature . Before my son uses the free time on the kindle I am going to have him to an exercise using this app and the word of the day before he plays any games .	1
This book is very user friendly and works much better for me than the dictionary that came on my Kindle . So happy to have found it . I would recommend it to all my friends .	1
This app is a lot of fun & amp ; easy to use . It has , in addition to a dictionary , a thesaurus , a daily mental exercise section , and other interesting sections . I love the fact that you can type in a word that you are looking for . It is definitely raise to use than the two dictionaries that came with the Kindle.I highly recommend it !	1
I have Dictionary.com on my computer and it is very useful . I now use my Kindle a lot more than I use the computer and this app is very helpful .	1
Dictionary.com Dictionary and Thesaurus works great for me . I use it very often . I love how everyday they give a word of the day , and there is a Thesaurus ... . it works great on Kindle Fire , Ipod , Iphone , any Android or Apple devices it will work great on ... I personally think this is the best dictionary app ( application ) on any device . It works a lot better than any other dictionary on a cellular device , or any other kinds of devices.Thanks , Annie	1
have this app on my android phone too . use all the time for myself and my kid . Love the talking search .	1
I love the app ! Even though you must have wifi it is great ! ! every thing works , fast and easy , even has some backgrounds if u would like a different one : D happy I got it , and tons better than stupid dictionary that came with my kindle ! ! its a must get kinda thing .	1
Well , it 's a dictionary , what else is there to say ? It works as advertised . If I ever figure out how to copy and paste , I 'll like it better .	1
Just being a handy dictionary and thesaurus would be enough , but the application has additional features , such as articles on usage and a & quot ; word of the day & quot ; in both English and Spanish that make it an application I use daily .	1
I used this app on my galaxy 3 phone & amp ; used it over 3yrs never had problems with this app , very helpful , I like the point rewards system something new I rate it 4 because I had the paid version on my galaxy 3 & amp ; still have to paid for it on my Kindle Fire HD just too much ad 's pop up	1
I love this app ! I have it on my kindle and my phone . I really enjoy getting the word of the day .	1
This app is the best dictionary app there is . The thesaurus is something I use a lot . I would recommend this app to anyone .	1
I have this app to use it for homework very useful . It great for using it to find certain words .	1
Really helpful . This is easy to navigate and it is easy to look up the words you want to know about .	1
I have been wanting a thesaurus for awhile now , since I 'm a writer , and when I stumbled upon this thesaurus APP I was so cheerful ! I am so grateful for this wonderful app : ) You have got to get it..and its SOOOO easy to use , by the way !	1
I seem to always need a dictionary . I like having one handy all the time . Also being digital helps too .	1
I like this app a lot and use it just about every day . Love to look up the word of the day	1
I like it I finally found one that works well . It does what I want and finds the words I need !	1
I down loaded the dictionary on my kindle fire I love it and I use it all the time . It will even pronounce the words for you .	1
Very useful as a dictionary , even useful because it is hard to look up a word when you ca n't spell it	1
The dictionary.com app is a great free app choice because of the variety of the words it has . The only down side is that wifi connection is needed to able to use to .	1
Love this app . Downloaded it to my phone so that no wi-fi or cell connection needed . On the road this is so nice . We will somehow , radio , book , whatever see/hear a word we are not familiar w/and out comes the dictionary . I feel like I am not left out in the cold because I missed a word . It is a great learning tool for everybody .	1
Wanted a quick simple way to look up words and discover new words and meanings . Without thumbing through pages and pages .	1
How can you not love a dictionary and thesaurus all-in-one ? ! I have two dictionary Apps on my kindle , and this is my favorite .	1
I use this one quite often . There is always a word I am looking for the correct spelling or definition !	1
This app is easy , user-friendly and most esp , it works . I 've always used Dictionary.com and having this app makes vocabulary check really convienient . A must-have . : )	1
I can use this if I do n't know how to spell something becouse . when I spell something wrong it gives up referable words I also use it for book reports . its great for a kindle too u should get it	1
Very handy..It really help me and my children with daily reading tasks . The grandchildren love it for school work . Great Deal. ,	1
great app . wish that it would have a list of words . I also wish tht it would work without Internet	1
The dictionary app has a companion thesaurus that is very useful . It also includes slideshows and word of day that are very entertaining . If you are a student , writer or just interested in words you will love this app .	1
This app fits the bill for checking spelling and looking up definitions when I get stuck on some crosswirds puzzles .	1
As dictionary apps go it is what it should be , full of words and their meanings . It tends to be a little light on meanings and potentially relevant examples or use in context . I use it alot and enjoy the word of the day feature , but the word of the day does n't update every day ( not sure if it is an application hang-up or if the publisher does n't update daily ) . It also has a great audio feature on how to pronounce the word ( which is cool ! ) . There are some other neat features and factoid tabs that offer an intellectual distraction from time to time . A very solid 4-star recommendation . As a freebie it is solid .	1
While the dictionary itself is n't as verbose/explanatory as going to certain websites , the app itself is much faster to use ( which matters a lot ) . Highly recommended ...	1
ca n't beat the price and it is a nice reference to have one hand when the writer 's intellect exceeds mine .	1
this app is totally cool . I sound like a nerd , but if you 've used it on a Pc or Mac or just regular computer you will be impressed by this app . it has lots of things on the home page that are daily facts that are interesting . you learn a new word ( in English and Spanish ) and other stuff each day . this app deserves 5 stars .	1
I like the simplistic search features of this app , plus you get a handy thesaurus tool , as well . A very user-friendly app .	1
I had this app on my smartphone for more than a year , and I used it frequently to look up a word while I was reading hardback books or writing my own book ( s ) and stories . It Worked very well . I can not remember any negative experiences using it in the past year on my phone.Then I got a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 a few months ago , and although there is a dictionary built in if you touch a word when reading a Kindle book to get the word 's meaning which is wonderful and easy to use . But I still needed a stand alone dictionary app to use on my Kindle FIre HD . I use my Kindle as my library of reference books , as I am a writer and got tired long ago using heavy books while writing . I especially enjoy and use the Thesaurus quite a bit when I am writing.While playing the game , words with friends , there was a few instances where a word suggested by the game was not found in this dictionary app . Not a factor of my satisfaction , due to those words are usually obscure and rarely used in today 's English language . Not a deal breaker for this FREE Dictionary.com app.I recommend this app . I am considering getting the paid version.This is a great app for my needs . Whether I use it on my phone or Kindle , it works so good . I can recommend it . I also put it onto my Grandkid 's Kindle Fire HD to help them find the meaning of words easily . They are 6 and 8 and they have both learned to use it . The 8 yr old does very well . The 6yr old is still learning it . YAY ! !	1
Works great for a free app . perfect for looking up words that you want to understand the meaning of . Its also easy to use .	1
I love this app . It is amazingly fast and works great on my Kindle Fire ( Android 6.3 ) . Dictionary.com app to the rescue !	1
I am just trying to learn how to use this product . I need someone to show me how to use it .	1
Like it lots better then the oxford that came on my kindle ... Much easier to use ... I have used it several times .	1
it gives you all the information , it 's just like a normal dictionary , but it 's not like & # 34 ; Wow , this is AWESOME & # 34 ;	1
This dictionary is easy to use , love having the app right on my tablet.I have others in my library on my tablet , they aremore difficult to use , I love to simplify my life as much as possible .	1
The app was very helpful and easy to use . It would be a very good app for anyone.its also fun for scrable .	1
Good thing to have on your devices . It 's a dictionary , what more can you say about a dictionary.That 's all.Grampyz	1
I really find this app helpful . I like the one touch over for the different categories for each word . I found this due to mpoints . Thank you mpoints . I recommend everyone to sign up for mpoints . I also love the slideshow on this app . I 've learned alot ! !	1
This is an easy to use and fully functional app for the Kindle Fire App.Also has a Thesores and other applications inside to use .	1
very simple and straightforward app . interface is easily maneuverable and easy to use . pretty fast too . would recommend if you like looking words up on your tablet .	1
Definitely tests my knowledge and I learn a lot . Good free app but need to be in the mood or have a specific need to use it	1
There are so many times I need to use this in writing and researching that I do . Covers alot in a small space .	1
I get homework that requires meanings of words and the dictionary app helps me under stand all the words . Try the app I liked so much !	1
Dictionary.com has been my online go to spot for definitions for years . I love having this same resource available on an app . Very easy to use .	1
It is not just a dictionary . It 's interesting and informative . There are slideshows and more . I think it is easy to use and fun !	1
The Dictionary.com app is a phenomenal resource ! I have it on my phone and Kindle and I use it often . Love that you can hear the pronunciation of a word , great feature !	1
I use it everyday ( I love learning new words , not because I 'm dumb ) and I can mark my favorite searches . Also , I can just click a word and it 'll search it for me . I . Love . It ! ! : - )	1
Sometimes I just like doing something mindless . This is good for that . You can make the bubbles all sizes and pop them at will .	1
When my1 year old plays this app he will not sop yelling bubbles bubbles and very time he sees the kindle he takes it and gives it to me so I . Can turn bubbles on .	1
This so cool . You can make bubbles . Small bubbles , big bubbles . Any size bubbles you want . It is so much fun .	1
Even my big kids seemed to like this one . Really cute , fun app . Fun sounds and colors for my little guy !	1
ok , this is n't an exciting `` game '' it 's not really a game . but my 2 and 4 year olds like it . They like `` blowing '' the bubbles and the noise it makes when they pop . Will this hold their attention no but they do n't get to use my phone often anyway , it 's more for when I need them to give me a few mins in the grocery store .	1
this game is pretty fun . It keeps me amused at times but i have to be in the mood to play it	1
This is a really great product but you must make sure that you get the version with the update otherwise the app closes without warning . The providers have been very , very responsive and have quickly made an update once they were advised and so if you get the updated version this is something that little hands will really enjoy . Too , I updated to the pay version with the colored bubbles and my little ones like it better - so do I .	1
I like this Solitare game for my Kindle Fire . The cards are larger than another version & easier to see . Works well . A great classic game .	1
Typical Solitaire but who gets bored of the old faithful Solitaire game when there is nothing else to do ... I enjoy it ! ! !	1
I like this game and it just seems to get me back regularly to play . Ads are on the side bar and not too disturbing .	1
There are two things I ask of a Klondike-type of solitaire program -- Vegas scoring rules and a deck of cards that is easy to read . Most ( but not all ! ) programs have Vegas scoring , but very few have visually appealing cards . They are invariably , crude , fuzzy , or just plain unpleasant to look at . Solitaire ( Free ) is one of two apps of the nearly dozen I 've looked at that satisfy both of my criteria . The other is Klondike Solitaire by Softick Ltd . Unfortunately , Amazon system wo n't let me insert a link to the Amazon page for the other app , but you can find it by using Amazon 's search feature .	1
I think this game is fun and very addictive . It 's on the same level as candy crush for me . Love it ! !	1
Know if you enjoy playing Solitaire this is a game for you . I play it over and over again and enjoy it .	1
LOVE THIS GAME . EASY TO PLAY , PLUS HAVE WON ON IT SEVERAL TIMES . WOULD RECOMMEND TO ALL , ESP . SINCE THE DOWNLOAD WAS FREE .	1
Running on Kindle Fire HD ... After trying several other Solitaire ( Klondike ) apps on my tablet , this is the one I kept . I have enjoyed many hours playing this game . The runner-up was the app from MobilityWare , which is a very good game - but its ads were so intrusive that I had to get rid of it . The Ads in this game are tastefully off to the side , and do not intrude on my playing enjoyment . It is otherwise absolutely as good , or even better than the MobilityWare game . All it lacks is sound - and I do n't really miss that . Bottom line - this is a 5 star keeper !	1
I play this game almost every day . Have enjoyed it . Would recommend it to anyone who likes solitaire . Fun game .	1
It downloaded easily and like the game played with cards is easy to play . Recommended for light entertainment . No cost .	1
This game is a pretty good challenge . Its more for adults and older children . My oldest enjoys it , but younger kids are just confused . Great game for ten and up .	1
A great game , with all the levels and the option to compete with best possible score or to just do your own thing and compete with yourself.Even share your accomplishments if you wish or not.I Like Choices ! ! Can be fun for hours or just a free minute .	1
The game is good but there is nothing new in this version of the game ... I have played many different versions of this game for PC , and Android.. Almost all are identical .. the only thing the really changes is the graphics from game to game and the design . but the play is the same and the rules are the same as well . Fun and challenging game to kill some time . Not a game I would keep on my Tablet for to long only cuz it only has 112 levels and in a matter of 2 minutes I beat the first 10 already.. seems too easy but it 's still a time killer . Fun game for kids to play to keep the distracted . 4 stars for the game only cuz it lacks change that sets it apart from the rest .	1
I like puzzles like this because , as a child I did not have many opportunities to use manipulatives while learning . As an adult I realized that I was spatially challenged . Puzzles like these are a good way for me to exercise my brain . At first I found myself randomly moving the pieces , but after a while , I started to think ahead and develop strategies for completing the puzzles .	1
If you 've played one version of this type of game , you 've pretty much played them all . There 's nothing uniquely special about this version ( other than the price - I was able to pick it up when it was the free app of the day ) . It 's your standard block moving game ... rearrange the blocks to clear the puzzle and move onto the next . A great little game to pick up and tinker with for short periods of time while waiting for the train , bus , at the doctor 's office , etc . This one is exactly what I expected it to be .	1
I actually like this game & amp ; have n't had any problems with the controls or lagging or anything else . My 1 complaint ( and reason for only giving 4 stars instead of 5 ) is the interface . There 's no way to choose individual levels & amp ; if there is I ca n't find it . The only thing you can choose is which difficulty mode you want to play . If you choose to replay a level it takes you to the previous level you had played . As far as I can see this is the only option to replay any level so if you want to try a level you had played 2 levels ago I think you 're out of luck . I am really surprised this game is made like that because it seems like any game now has the levels menu set up just like angry birds anymore . This is extremely annoying to me . I think this would be a 5 star game when comparing it to another basic game of this type if there was a level menu ! Btw , the developer reviews are just ridiculous and annoying . It 's kind of an insult for them to think us so dense that we would n't be able to tell those reviews are written by the developer and are obviously all by the same person . Wow ! It seems like all developers have their own language or something , like real users really talk like that lol	1
This is what i play when i am waiting on words with friends lol . I would recommend this to friends and family also .	1
Great app for keeping your brain challenged . This works great with the kids when they are bored . It keeps them busy and challenged .	1
This game is challenging and a lot of fun . Good for those who can exercise intellect more easily than dexterity .	1
Colorful block puzzle . simple in design , yet challenging for the mind . I have downloaded several block puzzles in the last year , this one is the best .	1
This is a great game . It forces you to think in geometric terms in house to rearrange objects in order to win	1
I love puzzle games , for free this is a fun and challenging game , can be easy or hard if you want to play a fun game try this	1
seems pretty good so far . I like that there 's no time limit and undo so you can think through to the best solution .	1
Fun , Challenging game.. Love to play puzzles like this . Thanks AmazonWorks great on my Kindle Fire.. And it 's free..	1
This is really nice to challenge you mind and thinking ahead . Not just moving pieces to move , but actually think about	1
This is an app that passes the time for you when you are stuck in line or in the phone tree . It is mindless and easy enough to not take all your mental effort but addictive enough to make you keep playing .	1
This is a fun little app for my phone ! I play it when I am waiting around ! ! ! ! ! I would recommend it to a friend !	1
This game is pretty good . It really makes you think . I have enjoyed playing it . If you like games that make you think then you will like it too .	1
They have a few of these out : One has a Vet you need to get out of the car lot , which I really like , and another is a limo , ( there all worthy ) of & quot ; must haves & quot ; ... I only review and keep on my list top games for all ages that play perfect on KF , so if your looking for more and do n't have the time to opean each one , simply check out my review list . Also for any question on anything , drop me a e mail , I 'm here to help.. Enjoy ! ..	1
Great puzzles , especially , if you love puzzles that really makes you use your mind ! Can be addictive ! The only thing , like to have a hint option . Overall , one to download ! Works just fine on 8.9 and 7 K.F . HDX .	1
Great game , wonderfully challenging way to pass the time ! It LOOKS easy but do n't be fooled , it 's harder than it looks to get each one in the number of moves suggested !	1
Keeps you , busy and intertained . You do have to limit the childrens time on this game . They will play for hours if you let them .	1
I love the game it is challenging . I typically take two or three tries to get the gold level . I lkie that you can score several different levels but it woudl be nice to have a replay button to attmetp the same puzzle over again . the work around I have found is to go to the next puzzle and then back .	1
Move it ! Is a clever variation of the old plastic sliding block puzzles that I loved to play as a kid . With those puzzles , you typically had a 4 x 4 grid with all but one of the squares filled with blocks that had some design or number on them ; the goal was to rearrange the blocks to meet a certain end configuration . In Move it ! the goal is to move the large red block into the shaded target square.There are six levels : novice , casual , standard , difficult , advanced , and expert , with a total of 150 puzzles . There 's also a short tutorial . You can toggle the music and sound effects on or off , but I liked the simple guitar music if the volume was turned down a bit.The mechanics of the game are very simple to learn , but winning gets progressively more difficult as you advance . Mercifully , there 's an undo button that will undo as many moves as you want to take back . Holding the button down for a second will reset the puzzle . If you 're hopelessly stuck , from the menu bar at the bottom of the screen , press `` View Solution , '' and you can see a move-by-move solution.I enjoyed solving ( or trying to solve ) the puzzles . They get pretty challenging after the first few , but it 's a great exercise in analyzing and solving spatial relations.I played Move it ! on my Kindle Fire , and it installed and ran perfectly . Interestingly , this is one of the few apps that I 've seen that runs well in both portrait and landscape orientation .	1
This game is fun and frustrating at the same time ! One minor complaint is that it does n't automatically advance to the next puzzle once you complete one . I like it better on my tablet than my phone . I also like going back and redoing the whole set later to see if i can beat my score . I do n't like that I forget how to do it ! But that 's just me !	1
I 've only been playing it for a short time but so far the levels have been pretty easy . Not sure what it 's like at a higher more difficult level .	1
This is a good game though I must admit that I ca n't figure out exactly how it determines the number of moves . The game is grid based and the figures are polygons but it appears the game counts ( somehow ) the number of grid squares the polygon moves and not just the fact that polygon x was moved .	1
I like this game because it 's challenges the mind . I would n't recommend this game for kids under 12 years of age .	1
Addicting very addicting ! I recommend this for anybody especially the people who like a challenge . This is recommended for all ages !	1
I enjoy the challenge of this game . The 'help ' is fantastic if you are not in the mood to be frustrated it shows you just how to do it so you learn something that can help with the next puzzle .	1
this app provides of fun with increasingly difficult puzzles . very easy to control and lots of fun to play highly recommended	1
This is another game that is great for a waiting room , long car ride , or a few idle moments on the couch .	1
I like that this game is not timed on the novice game . I can play a relaxed game . Then when I get better at it , there are more challenges .	1
I loved these kinds of games as a kid and this brings all those great memories back . Its also bright and beautiful . Wonderful ease of movement . That 's all i can say now . I want to get back to the game !	1
its awesome if you like problem solving games . it it kind of like block it . it gives you something to do .	1
Very stimulating for the brain ! My son who is an engineer likes it too . You never run outof new patterns to work	1
This game does n't work quite the way I thought it would . But , that 's not a bad thing . It makes the game more challenging . So far I have n't had any hang ups . The mechanism runs smoothly and is pretty straightforward . A good game to pass the time .	1
I love it . Makes you have to think and strategize before moving to guess where you 're going.I also like the fact that there are different levels .	1
It starts out easy enough but if your good enough to get far into the game it becomes well , impossible .	1
This app lives up to its Pc brothers Rep . The lack of the ability to edit the database is a bit frustrating , but for quick easy use it rocks !	1
Passwords are just a fact of life . I was one of those people that smarter people shook their heads at sadly because I had one password I used for everything . The more I read about identity theft and compromised info , the more I got that I needed to be more responsible , and I 'm not a tech genius , and my memory is 59 years old now . I can remember a phone number from when I was 13 years old . I can barely remember your name . So I started writing passwords down in a little notebook which I kept in a drawer by the computer . Yes , the smart people shook their heads again . This is better . I remember one password , and there are all my passwords in one place , in a searchable database . It 's easy to use . I have Keepass on my desktop , and once a month I try to remember to export the database so that I have the newest passwords for all those websites and so forth , and I drag a copy of that to Dropbox . Then from my app on my smartphone , I can open that database file and voila ! there are all my passwords wherever I am . Genius .	1
I love the simplicity of this app , and a better sense of security with no internet access.If I had a complaint , it would be editing what group a passcode file is under . As it sits , the only way I 've found is to delete the passcode and then add it again to the new group .	1
This is just the best way to safely store all your hundreds of passwords . The best part is that it is available for Android , all Linux platforms and PC ( and maybe also the Mac ) so you can easily copy your encryped database with your records when you update these , from device to device .	1
decent word variety and easy to use ... I have not felt any issue with ads , unlike other free aps ... pick up and play	1
fun and easy , helps get your mind thinking ! Easy to play by yourself or others . Great for someone with a little memory trouble !	1
good game.simple and to the point.only gripe is that it only allows certain amount of letters per word.but I still like it .	1
great ... loved playingthis game is easy to play and the word choices are pretty cool . wish it could be played in horizontal mode . enjoy ! ! !	1
hang time with hang man is sooo fun.I feel like I 'm learning to.remember things names all over.againLove it ! ! ; )	1
I absalutely love this game . Me and my friend , Kayla , love to play agianst each other . She alaways beats me because I 'm that good with spelling and words .	1
I cant wait to play ! I go to doc . all the time s this app will come in handy I	1
I have had no problems with this app . It is a good basic hangman game . I am using it on the kindle fire .	1
I have such a great time playing this I love that its multiplayer so I can play with friends . definately worth the download .	1
I liked it a lot . It is very fun to play 1or 2 players . If you like word games you 'll like this app .	1
I like it I mean it could use some touched but its ok my mottling brother and I play together sometimes it is gray to play in your free time	1
i like this app . i got it on my kindle fire , and it 's really fun and addicting . it sometimes gives really hard words , like once i got Damselfly once . what is a damselfly ? ? ? ?	1
I love this game . Its challenging and keeps u entertained for a good while . On the kindle fire you do n't even notice the ads on the bottom . Its tight for being free would recommend it .	1
I love this game . It 's so much fun to play with just yourself or another person . My husband and I dig it .	1
I really enjoy testing my brainit is challenging and fun . it is more tun than some of the other games I play.thank you . zara	1
It is what it is , a simple hangman game to pass the time . Works great on my kindle fire . Just do n't expect anything too fancy ...	1
It 's a fun game reminisant of the hangman game I played as a kid . It works fine on my Kindle Fire , which I was afraid it would n't do . Now if they only had a half-way decent tic tac toe games	1
Its kind of childish but it is hangman , which is a child 's game , and its free ! its a lot fun if you 're bored .	1
It was fun and challenging to play . I got it because it was free and its a good way to pass the time while the kids are asleep	1
I 've tried other hangman aps and they were awkward to play - odd fonts , screens too busy , etc . This one plays easy , works well with the touch screen and is just challenging enough to keep you playing 'just one more word ' .	1
Lots of fun ... just like the childhood game . Just wish you 'd get a clue for each word ( beyond the category ) .	1
love this game . addictive . i would like to be able to change the font as the one used does n't work well for me . the noise is annoying . but it is very satisfying with many levels . fun way to pass the time and work your vocabulary brain	1
Love this game . good catigories . Will play everyday . I am very addicted . I would recommend to my friends . ill be up half the night playing lil .	1
My 6-year old daughter just started to learn how to spell simple words . And this game is her favorite these several days . The font is a little bit hard for her to read but after sometime , she learned how to identify them .	1
My boyfriend and I have a blast playing this game on my Kindle Fire on the two player setting . We can play it happily for hours . The one player setting is rather boring . It would also be nice if you could do multiple words .	1
My kids really enjoy this gameThe words are words you use everyday . It is even teaching the little ones .	1
my whole family plays this game . though it does n't have spell check . beware when playing with kids who cant spell . still a blast with he kids and hubby !	1
nice game and it has lots of challenges . Only complaint is the font of the letters . They are hard for kids to recognize . Wish there was an option to change this !	1
Simple to use and can be used my all ages . Really is great on long trips . The download was quick and easy .	1
Thats all I have in my review list , so if your looking for nothing but the best , or you have one your self not on the list yet , simply drop me a e-mail with the name of the app or any question you might have , were here to help all Kindle Fire Users . Enjoy ! ! ... and remember , it 's EZ when you SEEK ! ! ..	1
This app is a lot if fun . I love hangman and this is the best one I have fond . If you like hangman then get this app .	1
This game is awesome and fun but some of the words that they give you to guess are kinda hard.I have never even heard of them ! Still this game is fun.You and a partner can take turns typing in words for each other to guess . You should . definenly get this game .	1
This game is exactly what I expected it to be . Some reviews say it 's too hard to play but I suspect their word power may be lacking .	1
This game is fun and entertaining . I play by myself of with friends . It is cute and good for the price ( free ) .	1
This game is fun for all ages but it gets boring after a hour or so.I like this game , I usually play it when I am bored to death .	1
This game is really fun ! ! ! Yiu do n't need to buy the real version because this one has no adds and is really fun ! Its nice that every 20 seconds its not asking you to rate it or upgrade .	1
This is a great app ! I love Hangman I alaways play it in class and on my kindle fire.The best of all , it 's free ! AWESOME APP !	1
this is a great , fun game . it can be a little difficult at times , but hey , that 's how you train your brain . : )	1
This is really good to play with younger siblings while in the car or doing something else to keep them entertained . I wish I could put longer words though .	1
Very fun game . I find some of the words challenging , but able to be solved . I will buy the regular version to support developers .	1
I like this game because you only need one person to play . It is fun to see if you can beat the hangman .	1
This game is fun for adults and kids . It 's like the traditional Hangman game with the help of seeing the alphabet in front of you .	1
Good game at a very good price . It needs a dictionary to make it educational . I would recommend it for all levels .	1
Game installed with no problem on my Motorola Xoom . It was fun and worked well . I tried it out on `` Easy '' and `` Animals '' and I thought it was a little tough . `` Krill '' and `` Ibis '' are probably not words that my 7 and 5 year old kids will get . I think I read that you can enter your own words so we might try that . Still pretty fun !	1
How many hours can you play hangman for ... apparently my opinion is a whole lot ! I 'm always surprised by their word selection .	1
this is an enjoyable game . Good mind exercise . I highly recommend it.It 's a good game to help your kids want to spell .	1
I was surprised and impressed . I did not expect it to be very good but it was AMAZING ! ! You 'd better get this game ! Also it 's a GREAT time killer . I advise you to get this game . I 'm gon na go play it . Bye ! ! ! !	1
This game is a very very very awesome game I love it.You should have or get this game.This is not what I expected , but it was very very very awesome game ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! # #	1
This game is a fun way to learn . It can be hard , but it is very addicting . I recommend this game for anyone who likes word games .	1
This game is fun . I like that you can play against other or the phone . I do n't have any bad comments about it so far .	1
This is a fun game that is also challenging . The interface is cute & amp ; easy to use . I love the hangman graphic -- so retro & amp ; adorable ! I enjoy playing this with my 10-yr-old granddaughter , 12-yr-old niece ( with our words ) , or against the machine . Great app !	1
Play it with my 5 year old daughter , she tries her best spelling & its a great way to spend time together !	1
We absolutely love this game . It 's so much fun and it 'll take you back to your childhood . My kids love it , we recomend this game .	1
My son loves to play this game with me so I downloaded it to my Kindle ... .we use alot less paper this way . Great recommendation !	1
Ooh , this was fun but challanging . Pretty clever apt , it allows you to pick from categories . The graphics and everything else is great . I have had no problems but getting stuck yikes ! in trying to guess the word . It will provide time of fun . I would purchase from this seller again . It 's really entertaining , so do n't hesitate to buy it .	1
my name is allie and i lovethis game it is osom i love it so me and my frend do not fite	1
This is definitely a fun app . Fun to play with younger kids . I play with my 11 year old and it is fun and also a learning tool . We have a good time .	1
I love this game . play it often . great words . no dog or cat . harder levels r great . words like exponentially . gets u thinking !	1
this app is great ! but some of the vocabulary might be a little too hard for younger kids . other than that ... .. DOWNLOAD IT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
This App turned out to be better and more engaging than I thought it would be . Try it you might like it .	1
you will be amazed at how many different words you can come up with to play with your children , whether you are watching tv you come up with a lot of words or if you are in the car and listening to the radio lots of words	1
This is fun ... .I bet the two player version would really be fun to play ... but single play is entertaining enough . Go ahead and try it .	1
Challenging in single player mode . A fun way to spend time waiting for a table or for the show to start in either single or two player mode .	1
It 's a great game to play with friends and is perfect for a long road trip.It 's completely free and I recommend it to you .	1
It is a good game but some of the words ive never heard before . It is also one of the first games I 've ever gotten on my kindle fire . I would recommend it to people who like hard words on hangman .	1
It is pretty straight forward . good way to waste time and use your brain . great if you have school aged kids .	1
This game allows you to play Hangman by yourself or with someone else . It is the classic Hangman game and is a lot of fun . My only complaint is that it does n't allow more than one word . It would be nice if it allowed you to guess simple sentences or phrases in addition to words , but it 's free so I ca n't complain .	1
HANGMAN IS A GREAT GAME TO PLAY . IT KEEPS THE MIND THINKING . NOT A GAME TO PLAY WHEN YOU ARE TIRED , because you will get frustrated .	1
I use this app to help my kids with spelling . I like that I can type in words for them to spell instead of it just using any random words . The kids even challenge each other with words .	1
This version of hangman has great graphics and sound and works like a gem . You get to choose categories for your words and really helps you work on your vocabulary . I would recommend . this game to anyone wanting a lighthearted . distraction . for a while . Enjoy !	1
A bit difficult but I like it that way , however , my niece and nephew found it difficult . Great app but needs a kid 's version .	1
Harder than I thought it would be . Not the Hangman I played in school . Several categories of words are given .	1
this app is fun for both kids and adults . lots of fun if u like a challenge.i like all the categories to chose from . wish it gave more chances but thats why so chalenging lol	1
good time for a quick change of pace ! From other games or from work try this child game you remember again	1
This is a very enjoyable game and is very addictive ! It downloaded to my Kindle Fire with no problems . I would highly recommend this game .	1
Starts out pretty easy , but does n't take long before you have & # 34 ; hung & # 34 ; yourself . Some of the words they are looking for are quite long . I am pretty good at word games , but this one is a challege ! On a lower challenge level , pretty easy to win .	1
Fun way to play hangman with my daughter , she likes the sound effects when we play and it is a good spelling game for her .	1
This game is a great way to guess words by yourself or with a friend.I would recomend this game to anybody who likes hangman !	1
Like this game	1
Playing Hangman is a very fun and learning game ... I really enjoy playing and learning some new words at the same time ...	1
I like the fact that the words are difficult to even hang me once in awhile . This is a good game for teaching spelling in a fun way .	1
not a bad game . good to kill some time and actually have to think a little ... you can play with two players as well where you make up the word for the other player	1
This game is so fun because you can play by yourself or you can make up words and let your friend guess it ... I love picking really hard words for my sister because she wont ever get the words ! ! GET THIS APP ! ! ! !	1
Buy it , great classic game to play with the whole family and friends , my daughter and I play this game alot and we love it .	1
While not an avid game player , I really enjoy this app . I 'm not sure what others expect from a & # 34 ; free & # 34 ; app but this one works great and met my expectations . Whatever ads are included in this & # 34 ; free & # 34 ; app have n't been noticeable to me or a big deal .	1
Great as a solitaire . Only problem is trying to keep a continuous score . You can not press ok and then leave the game . Just leave the game . When you come back your score will be there . If you press okay . The next time you play the game will be set at zero . Was able to get it up to 1000 wins , but do n't know if that 's all you can go , or if I pressed ok by mistake . Trying again .	1
I like it cuz it gives me something to do when I 'm bored or when were on a road trip to the beach with the family ! ! ! & lt ; 3	1
Classic game ! It is just funner with another person to play with , but for a free game it is good time waster . Great logic game too .	1
Hangman is fun but some of the words can be very adult . I wo n't let my kids play because your never really sure what the words will be like . But as an adult I like the game and find it challenging . I think most adults will enjoy this game .	1
This game is a nice mix of short and long words , common and uncommon words . It is not addictive , but it is a good brain teaser .	1
Very fun . I have a lot of fun when I play this game . I love how u could play 1 player or 2 players . I love playing this with my friends ! ! I always WIN ! ! I 'm champion ! ! Wow ! I totally recommend this game .	1
fun classic game , done with a simple point-at-the-letters format . You can choose from several vocabulary lists including a hard level with some tough words . It will build your vocabulary if you look up definitions of unfamiliar words .	1
if u love hangman u will love this app . the only is it does n't . give clues but it definitely increases vocabulary	1
We are condo hunting in a specific area and this app shows all available units . It also shows the last time the unit was sold and for how much as well as the value of my home . Great for both seller and buyer .	1
This is an excellent application that offers almost everything that the web site offers . I love using this more than using a browser because I can use my tablet and see pictures in the same way on a much smaller footprint . I did find one slight weakness in the tablet version which did not show a house which had a pending sale - it removed it from the & # 34 ; for sale & # 34 ; list . I did n't know why until I went to my PC .	1
I ca n't vouch for its completeness or its accuracy , or how up-to-date it is , but I have used it to review real estate prices in several areas around the country , and it came up with a lot of data very quickly . It settled a kind of argument between me and my wife ; turns out I was right that a house down the block has been on the market for over a year . You can probably find this same kind of data more quickly and easily on a computer , but if you just have a phone , this is a great little tool .	1
We 've used this a few times on the Kindle Fire and it works well . If you 're looking to relocate this is a great tool to have in your arsenal before you sit down with the realtor .	1
This is a great app for locating houses for sale . We are watching to find a home for our kids .	1
This is great and it comes so often . Gives your great ideas as to what is available in the area where you have an interest .	1
easy to use and great quality . even great for someone who has never looked for houses before online , or even on a tablet .	1
Save FAVORITES ! be careful of pricing great to get a pulse check when looking for vacation properties love the mapping to see how close flooding may be	1
Great app . You can search through listings for sale and/or monitor the value of your current property . I really like this app	1
This is a nice application however the interface could use a bit more work . I prefer the website or the Iphone app .	1
This app is great for finding your next home . Whenever my husband is transferred , I use it to scope out possible areas to live , as well as pictures of homes available in the area .	1
If you are interested in home values and what is available almost anywhere , this is the product for you . There are other apps/websites that show huge volumes of reality listings but this is the only one ( familiar to me ) that allows you to look at map locations and then see what is available as opposed to looking at addresses and then having to look up that address in a separate product .	1
My son has an app on his iPad that shows houses for sale . I wanted 1 for my Kindle Fire so I downloaded Zillow . it works great and shows all the houses in our neighborhood that are for sale . You can also look up rentals . It works very easily and is fun to show to friends .	1
Good info thru out the state , but nothing for the area I was looking in . Will try again later in the month .	1
this is a great app for anyone looking for property . it not only gives you pricing but also location , school districts and interior pictures .	1
A wealth of information . Great maps . Good graphs and charts present relevant information in a very clear and easy to understand way . The features for filtering results and being able to physically draw your desired search area are east to use and very helpful .	1
Kindle Fire user . It works very well . Able to search for houses , and use the search filters to narrow down selections . Only drawback is , some of the houses listed for sale are already sold . It 's like Zillow needs a better way for their database to stay updated .	1
This website offers a complete and thorough listing for each area and also gives you an idea of other property values .	1
It you want to check the housing market -- this is a helpful tool . On my smart phone and tablet the icons are difficult to work with at times when many homes are available in a certain area .	1
Always convenient for searching for a home . You still need to actually see the home before you buy because there is always so many judgements that only you can make in person . A good real estate agent is still necessary too .	1
Does n't have every listing in my area , but very comprehensive . If you 're looking to buy , sell or just interested in what 's available in your area this app is fo ryou .	1
Lots of information.Does n't clog up the cache too bad.Gives both rentals & sales . No need for two apps.Very , not bad .	1
Very informative and it is updated often . The information is correct and again up to date . I also have it going to my email when ever a new listing comes up . now I can just check it on my phone , laptop ; and Kindle ! It is convenient for my busy life .	1
I wish Amazon had more real estate apps in their market , because Zillow shows more for-sale-by-owner and a few bank-owneds rather than the MLS , but it 's a good app , the map works well , and I use it often . Much more convenient than using Zillow.com on the browser on my KFHD .	1
Works seamlessly on Kindle Fire . Great and must have for anyone interested in relocating , or in my case , checking out housing details before accepting a job . Provides all information you need in the housing search .	1
This app is super espically for finding a home or property values . even saw the house I grew up in much later in life . This app is really fasanating .	1
convenient , and easy to use .	1
another great app even if you are not in the market for a house you should read this book i looked up my house on it . you can also see what your neighbors house is worth . great aid if you are looking for a house	1
this app is very helpful when looking for a home.it allows u to put an address in of the home u want to view and some may even have pictures for u to view the Inside and outside of the homes . it gives u the sale Prices and how much it is worth in renting and buying .	1
It 's great to view housing prices or rental rates in all areas of the country . Works fast and easy . Very useful .	1
With seamless integration with Zillow.com , this app allows you to see homes for sale or rent in any area , including where you currently are . Listings include current listing price , along with all significant information and photos .	1
I also have this app on my IPhone . I particularly enjoy scrolling to coastal properties to fantasize of owning one of the multimillion dollar houses , lol	1
I love this app because it will alert me when there are new listings . I love the zestimate feature . It has been very helpful to my husband and me during our house search .	1
I absolutely love Zillow ! It 's my favorite real estate app for everything ! Land , homes , apartments , buying or renting . It has it all including stats/details , pictures , etc .	1
This is a very useful tool to find and track listings , housing trends and prices . I plan to use it a lot . I hope they are able to keep it current .	1
I use this everyday . I have been looking for real estate in another city and this has been great . I will continue to use it	1
I have never seen one like this before . It was great and user friendly . Yes , I would recommend it to friends and relatives .	1
I love this app . I am still trying to figure out how to change city or states . I know there has to be a way . You actually get to see the property .	1
The first day of the week I is not always Monday , for most of the world it 's actually Sunday . Duh !	1
So first off yes missing some important holidays like fathers day also to whoever complained about large file size its only 700kb suck it up and whoever complained about it reading your contacts that 's so it can get birthday info you entered in your contacts form not spam ... silly people but with some updates should her a useful app	1
How many of you have missed a rebate date : for example it say 60 days from day of purchase but 60 days is not necessarily 2 months ( if a month has 31 days for example ) . Anyway I 've been using an ad-laden website before for these calculations - great to see an app !	1
I like the idea of this AP and I find the available options it presents to be pretty good . Although there ate not to many uses for this type of app , when the do arrive it is nice to have an easy to use app to provide these answers.I do feel the need to take away some points for the number of bugs this app has.1 . The date calculator has no way to trigger the update of the target date after you enter values into the day/week/month/year fields . Instead I am forced to toggle the +/- buttons in order to get it to calculate.2 . A design flaw with the date calculator is that once you enter values in the fields the labels ( in the fields ) disappear . So there is no visual clue on which box is for which field.3 . Several of the apps pages do not provide a wide enough scroll wheel for the day portion of the date selector . This results in a display of 10 1 's and 10 2 's since the first digit is all that gets displayed.So although these bugs are annoying , they either occur on parts that I wo n't use much anyway or have an easy enough work around.UPDATED 6/11/2012With exception of the the second issue I reported ( not being able to see what entry fields are for what value once you enter something ) the other issues have been resolved.The +/- buttons trigger the app to recalculate and it does n't require toggling as I previously mentioned.The date selector is now using a cleaner interface to scroll through the date pieces and it works consistently now.Given those adjustments , and the fact the the developer took time to read , reply and react to reviews like this makes me change the rating from 4 to 5 stars .	1
I like the idea of this application very much . The developer did a great job , for sure . One thing I would suggest is to make some of the graphics a bit sharper . Again , the app is good . I like it .	1
I use this in addition to my calendar app . I like the various day and week tools ( diff between two dates , add/subtract from a date , week number , etc ) It 's also fun to use the & # 34 ; about a date & # 34 ; feature to find useless trivia about a date . It 's worth the cost especially if you need to do date calculations often .	1
Four in a row is a fun and sometimes challenging game . I like that there are different levels to choose from .	1
Tried this app out after a bad experience with a different connect 4 app . This one is perfect . This is not a complicated game and this app keeps it that way . The ads are unintrusive and there is a pro version if you want to get rid of them . Easy way for two people to pass the time together instead of ignoring eachother by staring into seperate phones . Single player against computer available , too . I do n't think it has app2sd , though . Epic 4G	1
Nice little app for kindle fire.Not complicated just fun.Great time killer.Enjoy playing it.would set even if no free.Runs well , no real downside to this app .	1
I found this to be a quick and fun game to play when sitting in waiting rooms or when you just have a little time to kill .	1
Nothing earth shattering . . . it 's your basic game . It gives you options of playing the outer or with someone your with .	1
trying to beat the computer sometimes throws you off at trying to complete your 4 . Which makes you think more and keep playing to win	1
I have a low end Android 2 device and this is the first game we found that always works . Easy to pick up and good for killing time .	1
I usually get the free stuff . I do n't play games normally , but it helps pass the time at the doctor 's office .	1
I am enjoying this great childhood game . It is fun to play during quick commercial breaks . The fact that it is free is great , too . a	1
Our family has a ball playing this game . It keeps us entertain quite nicely . Good way to spend time together and make your brain work too !	1
It is awesome ! ! ! ! ! I lose all the time but it is still lots of fun to play . Colors are cool too .	1
Classic Connect 4 . I love it . It is very addictive . Never played two player but Im sure that it is as much fun as the one player mode .	1
If you were a player of Connect Four , this is the same concept . It 's fun to play as well as a good stress reliever . I recommend this game for kids as well as adults .	1
This is a fun and easy app to play . Even my 3 yr old grandson enjoys it ! I ca n't believe I got it for free ! !	1
My grandson love the game it teaches him how to put things in a row for when he is at school .	1
It is a good game to play by yourself . You win sometimes and the computer wins sometimes . Every once and awhile , there is a tie .	1
Connect Four was solved in the late 80 's yet this app 's AI on its hardest difficulty still does n't play the optimal strategy . If you 're a Connect Four buff , this will disappoint , but for everyone else it wo n't matter.Otherwise this app works as advertised and is fun.A few other points : -It has ads-Sometimes the sound control does n't work and you have to go to options instead of using volume buttons	1
Without a doubt mSecure is the best , most useful app ever . In our modern world of passwords , how would one survive without mSecure ? Oh yeah , I remember ... Spreadsheets that you never had when you needed a password or you had to reset to get access and then you forgot to change on spreadsheet . My world is much easier with mSecure with me wherever I go !	1
the best app . people stop complaining and get a better phone . I do n't understand why people complaint on something free . If you do n't like it uninstall and shut up ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
Makes it so easy to store my info and do it safely ! and the fact that it backs up to Dropbox is lovely	1
There seems to be another Developer ( Keepass ? ) that is hijacking the reviews on this and , I 've got to admit , it makes me not want to use them at all . Just review the app on the merits of its capabilities , people , and do n't knock an app down because it does the same thing something else does.That said , I recommend this for a lot of the people I work with . It blows my mind how many people have one password for everything from their domain login to bank account access . If one sight gets hacked , these people are going to be in a lot of trouble.This app is great because it is stored on your phone , which most people ( especially myself ) have everywhere and is easier to grab then information in a dropbox account.I do think the $ 5 is a little steep , or at a minimum include the ability to perform a desktop sync ( that costs extra ) . I also wish the app would lock itself whenever you exit because if you forget to lock it and somebody steals your phone then they will have access to all your passwords ... and a way to export them quickly ... until you figure it out and remotely kill your phone .	1
Have the Mac version on my iPad and could n't live without it on my phone .	1
I used this app and another pw manager and I like this one the best . The options of backing up the database won me over . The devs are very responsive . I had an odd issue , we did a bit of emailing , and seems with a fresh install , the issue has been fixed . Very professional ! Thanks !	1
As with any similar program only good if you use it . So far this has been a great place to store user names and other sensitive information . It is itself password protected . Biggest annoyance is it nags you to review it . There is a way to dismiss it but I like this so much I kept it on till I finally got around to reviewing it . Great app	1
you can sync from your phone to another by going through dropbox without compromising your data . You should take a look at what 's out there before you slam a great app without fully knowing what it does . I sync between my phone , kindle , and computer . This app is the bomb .	1
Great app for keeping your passwords and personal info safe ( birthdays , anniversaries , etc. ) . UI is not the greatest but app does what it 's supposed to do - keep your info safe !	1
If all the ppl rating this app poorly had any common sense instead of wasting time writing bad reviews they would use the report an issue option rather than submitting a bad review I on the other hand agree with the other positive reviews this app is very clean and easy to use	1
I use this app daily . I got it as `` AppOf The Day '' , however I have since purchased the desk top software so now it is accessible from both the PC and the phone . It works flawlessly . Thanks msecure .	1
This is the only password app I like ! Do yourself a favor and try it . It is fully customizable and easy to use . It has a PC companion and a free , separate data-import program . I feel completely secure using this system .	1
This is the best password manager I 've found . The ability to back-up to your computer as well as Google Drive is awesome .	1
Works in gTablet . The axes were reversed but the settings menu let me reverse each axis , separately if I needed to . The graphics adjust while you are playing to show the angle ; they seem a bit jumpy , but you can turn them off in the settings too ( show board movement ) . Also includes sensitivity levels which I did n't touch . There 's even a 2D option which I did n't try or need . Nice implementation with enough options to make it work for different devices with various default settings .	1
I have tried a few of the labyrinth apps out and I usually find myself uninstalling them shortly thereafter ( strangely enough - I like the one on the Zune HD the best ) . But , I did find this one to be very fun and I enjoyed playing it ( as has multiple others from 7 yrs to 60 ) . This one is a keeper and I would have been glad to pay for it if it was not the FAOTD when I `` purchased '' it .	1
This game is a lot of fun ! Its easy at first but gets more and more challenging as you move on . The graphics are good . I would recommend this game ! HTC Thunderbolt .	1
I have definitely not played this enough to give it a good review , but so far I am liking the game . I have to agree with the others about the price for the game , it would probably receive a much better response if it were a .99 cents app . No problems with the tilt sensing and whatnot on the HTC Evo . I have played all of three levels and know I will probably get into it , reminds me of the similar app on the iPhone .	1
I remember playing a similar game on iPhone , and it was one of my favorites . The controls are a little sluggish , but what 's great about this app is that you can tweak them . Also , you have full control over Open Feint , so you can log out if you do n't want to be connecting over the Internet . Such a great feature that other games tend to hide .	1
good tilt type game . It is nice that there easy to hard levels to pick between . this way a new player does n't get frustrated	1
Got it back on the free app of the day and just got around to playing with it . Its a great looking app graphically and the way the menus function . There are a huge amount of free boards and just as many free download addon ones . Online functionality too . If I had done a demo and this app was 3.99 I would probably end up buying it . Thank you Amazon and app Dev .	1
very entertaining and accurate , it feels like a real board and puzzles are challenging but it does n't work on android Honeycomb ... yet	1
This app WILL make you angry when you ca n't get the damn little ball in the damn little hole - do n't say I did n't warn you .	1
looks good and runs nicely . love the 3d graphix thay change when you tilt the tablet.great way to kill time .	1
Installed on a Nexus S. This app is entertaining and keeps you playing . I question its sensitivity . Works without lag and does n't seem to eat battery or system resources .	1
I love showing my phone off to friends and this is one of my go-to apps for showing off the accelerometer . Very fun as well and I 'd love to see how it works on one of the new 3D phones because the walls and back do 3d software effects when you tilt it as it is now on my 2D screen.The odd thing is it does n't stretch the full length of the screen but it 's not a huge deal and does n't take away from any of the fun .	1
I 've had this app for a week or so and its seems fine . I 'm waiting a couple of more weeks to see how it works out before I give it a 3 or 4 .	1
this app has really helped me manage my money . I get to track all my bills and most importantly I can always know my actual account balance without relying on the bank website which takes forever to process some charges .	1
Very well made app , great if you 'd rather enter the data yourself , and not integrate it into all your accounts.One particularly interesting feature is the ability to set transactions as repeating daily , weekly , monthly , or yearly . Any transaction , income or expense , so yes , biweekly pay is supported . The option is obviously and readily available right where you input the transaction .	1
Wonderful Tool to tell me where my money is going ! At first I did not think the App gave me the info I wanted . After tweaking with the settings and running some reports , I now have an app that feels like a financial assistant .	1
*some* people ( not naming names ) have posted reviews when they do n't even have the app.. very sad ! I have only played with a few of the functions , but so far it seems to be a pretty good financial app ! It *is* free.. if you bother to actually hit the `` purchase '' button , instead of coming on the review site and griping about something that has *nothing* to do with the performance of the app , your conformation e-mail will tell you it was free . It must be a glitch in the way Amazon posted it.. it has nothing to do with the developer , or the app !	1
The only problem with this app is the lack of a desktop entry application with a way to sync . When I 'm paying bills I do n't want to have to pick up my phone to make an entry .	1
Previously , Mr Dutton said this app would not allow bi-weekly recurring incomes . This is not true . When setting up an event , simply indicate the recurrence as `` 2 '' and the frequency as `` week '' , and then set a start date . The app will then indicate the next event date and you are all set.From what I see , this is a very full featured app , although the previous reviewer was correct in the comment about only allowing a single level of sub-category . As long as that is the level of control you need , this looks like it will perform well for your needs.I only just started checking it out and so do not have extensive experience yet , but those who have long term experience really seem to like it . It is feature rich but not entirely intuitive . It is also not as bad as some of the reviewers would have you think.Give it a shot of you need something like this . From the revision history ( goes back to initial release ) in the app , it looks like the developer has put a lot of thought and effort into this product .	1
Once upon a time ... I was searching for a budgeting app & amp ; came across MoneyPro . Lots of good reviews , tons of features , but it had too many features & amp ; I could n't figure it all out . Disappointing , I paid $ 7 for it ! Searched again & amp ; decided to try a free app this time-Toshl . Really cute , got the job done , but not enough features ! Searched again & amp ; there it was EasyMoney ! Has lots of features & amp ; its easy to understand utilize + I got it when it was free ! I love it , got rid of the other apps & amp ; can now live happily ever after ... that is , as soon as I find a publisher for this novel sized review ! Thanks for reading : )	1
I made a New Year 's Resolution to be smarter about keeping track of my money and Amazon recommended this app . Easy money could not have come at a better time . There are other apps like it , but so far this has been great .	1
Ben using this app for well over a year . If you got the chance get it while it 's free . And if you have bugs it 's because you 're phone sucks works perfectly on HTC EVO 4G .	1
this is a superb money tracking app . five stars easy . works perfect on my viewsonic gtablet . best thing was getting it free on Amazon .	1
This beats hands down what I had used in the past . Plus I found much easier to use . If you cant use this app I would suggest going back to school .	1
Love this money tracking app . Very versatile and flexible . Makes managing my finances much easier . I can track multiple accounts and get bill reminders , and it keeps track of multiple budgets , all in one !	1
This app does not sinc with any actual account which is why I like it . It helps me budget and keep track of things without worrying about security . You can set up for multiple accounts and have them interact automatically ( such as automatic transfers between them & mdash ; again , not tied to any actual transaction ) . My device is the Fire .	1
exactly what I needed . I take my kindle with me everywhere and this app is so easy to use . thanks	1
I absolutely love this app . it is great for keeping track of my account balances . its a great way to balance your checking account .	1
I know what many of you are thinking , I must be crazy to say this app can top mint . You may be right , but not at all for that reason . I tried mint for like an hour and I really disliked how it worked . I changed my back account 's password after deciding I disliked it , and their sync with my bank account made me suspicious anyways . While having things automatically updated would be nice , I am the type of person who is suspicious of almost everyone and everything around me . So , back onto this app now ... Pros : Keep track of your money on your phone.Know how much you have available after incoming expenses.Be able to know when your next insurance payment is using daily reminders.Budgeting which can help you plan your money before you get it.The app does n't use your bank account info.Cons : All manual entry.Only one sublevel.As far as I am concerned , these cons are a small price to pay for the pros . I got the app free during one of Amazon 's things , but this app is easily worth twice what they ask . Go ahead and give it a try and I am sure most people will at least like it , if not love it .	1
Downloaded this when it was the FAOTD . I 've been using a planner to keep up with the budgets because I do n't like programs that require access to my bank account , and because things take forever to clear that way . I much prefer to keep track manually , so this was perfect for me . I wish that there were bi-monthly options for payment and budgeting , and I only started actually using it on my Kindle Fire for a couple of days , but so far , bug-free and very handy ! The only other issue ... $ 10 is a little high . I never would have tried it if it were n't free .	1
This is the best accounting app I have tried . I found it easy to use , very accurate , and love that you can ignore an account in your overall balance . That to me makes it a deal breaker . I had no trouble installing or operating . I have had it crash on the Droid X when I try to use the camera/scanner feature , my work around , do n't use this feature .	1
Easy to use and very convienent . Really helps with budgeting . Would recommend to anyone . Works on my Samsung G3 with no problems .	1
Does n't link to your accounts . Awesome ! Any money that the bank took from you is easy to see . Easy money balance minus actual balance equals money the bank took from you .	1
I love the ease of use and it was very easy to set up . I find it so much easier than trying to keep up with a conventional register .	1
This app offers a listener a ton of choices when it comes to listening . I do n't often use it , but but when I do I can find exactly what I 'm looking for .	1
It 's very good . Most of my stations are on here . I love the music and the sound is great . I recommend this to anyone who loves music .	1
I have been playing with this app like a new toy.I am liking it ! I can even get my scanner on it . More I signed into this bad boy andit had all my local stuff right there .What ! ! ! ! ! ! This thing it great you might want to try it ! I did and I am lovvvvvvinnnn itttt .	1
I like listening to the talk shows and news on the radio . Many of the shows I like are located on the AM band and thus not available on some devices that only broadcast FM . And if you listening in the car you may drive out of range for good reception . TuneIn Radio to the rescue ! This application is very well organized , easy to use , the sound is great , no buffering delays . What I like best about the UI that is very easy to narrow down on your favorite show by just searching on the title , and then select from several choices . You can store your favorites in the 'favorites ' list for quick access.When the app comes up you get a list of choices : - Local radio- Recents- Recommended- Music- News- Sports- Talk- By location- By language- PodcastsIf you select Talk shows you get further refinements : - Business- Comedy- Conservative- Entertainment- Ideas- News- Progressive- Public- Religious- Specialty TalkThen if you select , say , Public Radio then you get a list of NPR stations from all over USA so you have more choices of times for the specific program you like.This app works well on my Samsung Galaxy 7.7 Tablet running Android HoneyComb 3.2 . I had no technical problems and the app scales to my screen size very nicely.This is a terrific app : Huge amount of choices for radio shows , great reception , excellent interface . I highly recommend.Ali Julia review	1
I downloaded TuneIn Radio to use on my Kindle Fire HD a few days after I downloaded iHeart Radio . TuneIn Radio was so much more intuitive to use and worked more smoothly on the Kindle Fire HD than the other one . I might try iHeart again in the future but for now I prefer TuneIn .	1
I love this app ! It allows me to set presets and just listen while I do other things . I like talk radio and I can find all the stations I want to hear . I set them as a preset then start it up while I am in the shower or cooking . Even as the screen goes dark on the Fire , it still keeps going . This one is a keeper .	1
Every radio station I have looked up is available ! This app came in very handy tonight since I do not have a weather band radio and we had nasty weather . This app us one I will be keeping .	1
This ws a great tool when I was in hospital recently and was n't prpared to pay the rip-off prices associated with radio TV etc . There were no noises from my fellow sufferers either . Maybe it is just the hospital management 's way of keeping wards quiet !	1
I LOVE that I can listen to BBC Radio1 live in Baltimore Md ! BUT , other stations that I listen do daily are no longer available ?	1
This app is amazing ! I cant believe all the stations available ! If you put in a `` Christian '' search it comes up with shows from Joyce Meyer and all the greats ! Thanks for such a great radio app !	1
What a great , easy to use app . I get all my local AM & amp ; FM stations with clarity . Recommend this one for sure . Thanks !	1
if you like talk radio this is an app for you . it has live broadcasts as well as delayed broadcasts , so if you miss your favorite show you can hear it later .	1
I use this app more than any other app on my tablet . I use it to listen to talk radio on the AM frequencies . When I moved to the country I lost the opportunity to listen to AM because the radio signal was just too weak . This app gives me back the opportunity to listen any time of the day or night . I will rate this app a five when the reception stops dropping out .	1
Great app for any station that is not a Clear Channel station . Very easy to navigate and use and has many of the same features as iheartradio .	1
I have not used this a lot but when I have , I have enjoyed it . Good selections of music types and sounds good	1
I like how you can listen to various radio stations both local and international.Never came across an app like this . I highly recommend it .	1
Great and easy to use . Search is easy to us . One can use it while driving ; plugging kindle into car .	1
This is one of my favorite apps . Absolutely love it . Now we just need a widget and a way to integrate it with local media and Amazon Music Cloud services .	1
We listen to music on this app several hours each day and find it to be a quality source of music . There are stations here for everyone .	1
I use it to hear special programs when I am out and about . Some times changes stations on its own , but overall it works well .	1
I was out of town and wanted to listen to a local college basketball team play . Found the station and the sound was better then on the radio . I then used it for some music and it was even better .	1
I had to hunt around a bit to find the live program I was looking for - it 's not obvious . But other than that , it gave me what I expected .	1
by far my most favorite app . limitless radio choices from around the world . and its free ! thank you ! thank you !	1
I use this everyday at work to listen to my favorite morning talk radio show , Bob and Tom . I have n't had any problems with it .	1
I am esctastic ! My uncle downloaded this app on his Galaxy Tablet , and I was obsessed with it ! Now I have founded it , I can listen to it whenever I want to ! PS it also good because you can listen to different songs without buying them ...	1
Not quite the satellite station in my car -- but it has enough choices to keep me going.Nice choice of musical styles !	1
This works much the same as a traditional radio and allows me to access many services that I enjoy . Podcast are also available but subscribing is not as far as I can tell .	1
So far , it works as advertised.I really like it because I like to hear my talk shows and news through my wireless bluetooth headphones rather than wake the household in the morning ! Plus , I get really bad reception for many of my & # 34 ; local stations . With TuneIn , I get crystal clear stereo radio , exactly as if I were listening on the regular radio ( slight time lag , so do n't try to win any call-in contests while listening via TuneIn ! ) Add to that , I can listen to other stations across the country ... not just in my tiny closed area with little radio choices.I 'm using it on an AT & T-branded ; Samsung Galaxy S3 , and so far I 've had no problems at all .	1
I 've used quite a few radio streaming apps and this is by far the best . Streams load really fast ( dependent on phone type and network ) . The UI is also REALLY clean and looks good too . I will carry out a test by playing my car radio and this one side by side to see if there is a delay in transmission for this app . Anyway , this is one of the most basic apps every Android user should haveT-Mobile G2	1
better than itunes radio . can be on the go . Too bad apple did not put radio on the ipod , but who has podcasts anymore ?	1
I use this more on my ROKU and listen to it through my television . No need for XM radio you can get everything through this app or channel depending on which device you use .	1
OMG i love this thing ! Have kindle Fire HD and the sound is amazing ! Tons of stations , great reception , easy to use ... music anywhere ! also has local police and fire scanner , what fun . Highly recommend !	1
I really like this app a lot but of course you ca n't use it if you are away from your wi-fi signal . And we can only use up so much data allowance per day . An app like this will quickly go through all your allowance . We are on satellite and do n't have the most expensive plan so we do have to be careful of how much we use . But it will be really nice if we are staying in a motel where we can listen to the music all night . Which by the way , you can choose any state , then any station and then any type of music . Even talk radio . Anything you could possibly want to listen to . Probably one of the nicest apps around .	1
This is great for what it is . You get access to 100 's of radio stations all over the country . Basically turns your phone into a radio but one that is easy to carry around . Now you can listen to the radio on an ipod but only local . For some people that is no big deal but for sports fans etc , this can be pretty cool . Like it !	1
This is the best app I 've come across . If you were ever looking into the logitech internet radios that cost in the 100s this app functions and does everything that the logitech product does . A very nice app with access to any radio station I can think of in any city , state country . Was listening to music in Daka bangladesh , ( I think thats the capital ) . The New York link has hundreds of stations and the buffering works quite fast.An excellent app .	1
I was searching for my favorite independent radio station on my Kindle and Voila ! there it was ! Great job , TuneIn Radio !	1
it is amazing . I can just listen to my favorite radio station anytime I want ! especially in ... um EVERYWHERE ! ! ! ! I love this app ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
I love this app . have it on my iphone/ipad . now on my kindle fire . I just wish the kindle fire app could record like the Apple app .	1
Fantastic app allowing radio access on the fly . Works very well . Was dissappointed that my favorite station was not available . That 's where I had my aha moment and discovered I can listen to other stations in other locations that cover the same topic . Great stuff !	1
This is a great app that to me is worth $ 5 . Has a ton of streams that work well and do n't cut out . Allows you to find sports , news , entertainment , and talk in basically every medium sized city in the united states , along with a good selection of international stations . Easy to control . Get it now !	1
After trying some other radio apps and being disappointed , I approached this app with caution . I am SO glad that I installed TuneIn ! This app has a HUGE library of stations , and not just big national ones either . Every local station in my area is listed and the quality is great . The fact that it has a built in alarm is just icing . I like this app so much , I upgraded to the pro version .	1
This is nice , now I have a radio in my Fire HD . I can tune in to my stations on my Fire and still surf the web . I like it .	1
Nice app . Smooth interface . An earlier review claimed that it blocked incoming phone calls . Do n't know what their problem was but this app works great on my Droid X .	1
Today I got the best app ever . I cried . *touching* I can listen to any artist and any song anytime I want to . I hate pandora and songza ! *stabbing pandora and songza app*Scene Ending Momento Noweno	1
I can finally get local fm , am and bbc radio one on my phone . Works great ! Highly recommend.I have n't had any force closes do I like it a lot .	1
sound quality is great . no issues as of yet . surprisingly easy on my atrix battery life . stations are very easy to find , great for those fringe stations that you like but have a hard time picking up over the air . look forward to using it during football season to pick up radio broadcasts of teams i cant get locally .	1
I use this app every day . We are moving and everything is almost packed , so I have this app to use on my kindle fire , which I have near me at all times	1
I love this app ! I like this so much more then I Heart Radio . I like that I can listen to local and world wide stations . I can listen to police scanners ( which is fun ) . I also love that it is so easy to find and listen to my favorite podcasts . I can listen to radio shows from the past when I ever I want . So easy to use on my Kindle Fire .	1
With this radio I get to listen to stations I could only get in my car before . I love to turn it on at home and hear it anytime ! good job ... hope you enjoy it also .	1
i love this app . so nice to listen to stations without all the chatter and commercials that other radio stations have . i would recommend this app .	1
i love tune in radio I choose my music type and categories and I can listen all day if I want too ! awesome . And it was easy to download thanks Amazon you guys are great !	1
Love this app for the Kindle Fire . A wide selection of stations and audio sources at your fingertips . I particularly like the ability to select the quality of stream and the reliability rating the software assigns to individual streams . The suggested listening based on current selections is usually spot on .	1
Tune in radio is a must have to own app , you can listen to music , sports , news or just about a thing you can think of on radio with this app covering every country in the world right at your finger tips AM so in love because now I can listen to everything that goes on in my country even though am not living there is like home away from home so in love with this app and highly recommend it .	1
I like Tunein radio because it has a bunch of choices in the music I like to listen to.I would definetly refer this to my friends .	1
This is a great app for radio ( especially talk radio ) fans . Has most of my favorite stations , and even some new ones I found via this app . Recommend .	1
I Love my music so much , and this app after being updated is one of the best ever now ! ! . You will simply love all the options and free music , and channels it has . You name it , it 's in here : Talk , rock , sports , the list goes on forever ! ! . This is the ITunes app for kindle fire . I love it and hope you will too , but never forget : Life is EZ , when you SEEK , for all your ( Must Have ) apps , and information.. Dont delay , rock today ! ! ! .. : - )	1
I love how I can listen to any radio station in town , or across the country . I also like the podcasting choices , i have listened to many episodes of This American Life ( highly recommend that show ) . And this app is easy and reliable and does n't crash , unlike some other radio app 's i have tried . I bought the Pro version on my iphone , and I can also record live radio on it for listening later . Very nice app .	1
Downloaded and went thru it and found it very useful . Located all the stations playing my favorite type of music or talk , and set my favorites . Very easy to use .	1
I just downloaded Slacker and it was horrible ! I did n't let me skip songs that I do n't like unless I upgrade . this app is way better !	1
Using it on the Kindle Fire HD whenever my local ABC radio station decides to cut into programs I like with their own & # 34 ; expanded & # 34 ; coverage of things like the Boston bombings . Ca n't always find a station via iTunes radio that does n't cut in with their own coverage either when such events occur . TuneIn Radio has -- so far , and I emphasize so far -- been better .	1
I keep raving about this app to anyone who will listen . There are so many categories . Sofar I have just concentrated on music but even there it opens up whole new worlds . If you like classical , you can listen to local NPR music station , or to one in London , or I often like Avro , a Dutch baroque music station . I have tried New Age , World Fusion , and each category gives one again several choices . And the sound of the HD Kindle Fire is just wonderful . Yes the Kindle comes to bed with me where I often will continue to listen to music with lights out . Listened to station in South Africa . One can choose music according to language . I would love the Kindle if this were the only thing it did . It is just so amazing . On my laptop I used to listen to Itunes radio but they did away with that . Do n't understand their thinking . Anyway , they made changes to Itunes for the worst of it .	1
Has alot of stations to choose from and the sound is very clear . Glad I downloaded , would recommend to anyone .	1
You can search for radio programs or stations , and get an immediate result of stations currently playing that program . And you can do this without signing into any third party . Saving favorite stations is also built into the app and works on the spot . It runs fast , is easy to use , and self contained what 's not to love ?	1
it is so easy to use its fun and the radio plays even when your playing games and browsing the web it is awesome i am 14 and i love it i use i every day : )	1
I got this app in hopes of being able to listen to Alex Jones . Did not find him in the menu/index , so I put him in the search box and Boom ! There he was ! The great thing about this app is once I start a radio program to play , i can then open my web browser and surf the net whilst listening to Alex Jones and without it skipping a beat .	1
very good app love it is awesome and I spend hours on it better than Pandora by a million times	1
Tunein is one of the BEST apps ever . The music on my Kindle fire hd sounds amazing and it was free ! !	1
I 've only said this about a handful of apps . But this is an app that every android user should have on their phones/tablets . Especially since it is free and it works beautifully . You are up and running , listening to a large variety of radio stations , within seconds of launch . The sound is crystal clear and it is nice to be able to tune in to my favorite radio stations no matter where in the world I am .	1
Works great ! Easy to use . Listen to stations all over the country , excellent reception . Create favorites list . Highly recommended app .	1
Stumbled across this somehow and am glad I did . While local radio is n't a big deal to me it quickly found all my & quot ; local & quot ; stations without issue . But , seriously ? Forget that . Start browsing around and listen to stuff outside your home country . Listened to a bunch of stations in Romania for a while , for no particular reason than that we could.Have encountered a few stations that , while listed , do n't play . Now who knows why this is ? Perhaps the stations streaming server has issues ? Maybe they somehow blocked TuneIn from accsessing it ? I do n't hold it against the app though ; just part of online life in my book ! Know that several stations still continue to stream fine even when my phone drops down to 1x on Verizon . So to those complaining about buffering and such , it 's either your connection and/or the stations streaming bit rate is more than your connection wants to deal with . Once again , AFAIK , not the apps fault.Really happy with it . Sleep timer is great as I use it every night to help me pass out . Has an alarm setting too ; have n't played with that yet . Presets seem to work fine too ... and that 's a good thing .	1
It 's ok for me . Does not have all the local stations , but not all of them stream online so it 's not the apps fault .	1
works awesome bar none better then the rest of the music apps and it has all the stations on it not just the unknown ones .. Pandora is moll but this is awesome get it now !	1
I was thrilled to stumble on this app with so many to choose from out there . Great selection of stations , but users need to understand that many of the stations are n't broadcasting 24hr/7days/week . For example , I was able to listen to the Green Bay Packers game on tunein today , but that station is only available as a live broadcast unless you buy the pro version which I understand to be buggy and/or limited with regard to recording and playback options . However , there are many live radio stations , both local and from around the world that are available all the time . I 'm so impressed with the free version that I could n't ask for more . I do recommend it highly .	1
I got this app because my wife was going to be on a local radio station , but not one big enough to be in the & # 34 ; heart & # 34 ; group . I was able to load the app and find the station within a few minutes .	1
This is an outstanding app ! A Super app that everyone must have to stay in touch with the world . Everyone will enjoy the many types of genre 's to choose from great radio stations .	1
I can get any radio station in the world or any genre of music at ANY time ! The best music app I have found !	1
this app just gives n does it quite well . commercials and such are kinda how radio pays the bills BUT this app has great selection far beyond other apps of this type like I heart radio which is ONLY clear channel stations granted that 's a majority . this app has so much variety . my main source for music & amp ; entertainment is this along with Raditaz . check it out then go for the PRO version its well worth the ONE TIME fee .	1
Works great for local radio stations . That 's about all I 've used it for so far . It has more features like live internet radio streams and whatnot.I like how it 's designed like you 're changing radio stations on a normal radio	1
Although not every station is available there are more than enough to make you feel like you are in LA or Chicago or Philly or England and most anywhere else in the world . You got to try it .	1
I have this on my iphone and my kindle fire . It works as promised on both devices . A solid performer . One of the features that I use is the favorites menu . Very editable , east to add and delete stations . The screen formatting is different on my kindle , but it works well and I will get used to it .	1
I 'm not sure why , but I have tried just about every streaming radio app out there , and this is the only one I have found with has 101X ( 101.5 FM ) from Austin , TX . I 'm just outside of the coverage area for the station , and miss it so much , I was happy to find an Android app which would let me hear it .	1
Love all the stations and the archives of various shows . For the most part it works really well but ever now and then it freezes while trying to open a podcast and I have to force close the application .	1
I think that it is wonderful being able to listen to stations from all over the world by using this application . I would recommend this .	1
This is the first app I have tried from the Amazon App store , and as it turned out , this was a good place to start . It works amazingly well on my HTC Inspire 4G , and it is not complicated to learn to maneuver through it and find what you want to hear . There are so many good choices for listening . I was a little disappointed to find out that my two local hometown stations are n't there , but then a message in the app told me that they have not been made available for streaming .	1
I was trying to listen to a radio station on my Kindle and found there was n't an app for it . I was able to find this FREE app that allows me to listen to many many radio stations ! It comes in loud and clear . I was not aware this app existed , but I would recommend it to anyone who loves to listen to music !	1
Easy to work within , good selection of stations . makes it easy to find music you are in the mood to listen to . I like being able to have favorite stations and also recent station for reference . You can also listen to news , events , just search and you will find something to enjoy . I have this on my phone to listen with earplugs outdoors while gardening as a change from my iPod . I used to live on the other coast so it is fun for me to listen to stations from that area but there are also stations around the world as well better than a previous app and much better than iHeart radio app .	1
this app is the best app ever if you cant download any music on your kindle fire . get this app it is woo good and you would love it woo much ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! : )	1
I found this app on Amazon and thought it would be great to have on my 7 '' android tablet . The selection of music is fantastic and I love the fact that I can just relax and listen to the radio or do other things on my tablet while I listen to my favorite music . I like the fact that you can preset your favorite stations so there is no searching around trying to find them again . The variety of radio stations is really good ... there is something for everyone ! If you like to listen to the radio , this is the app for you !	1
I love listening to music when I 'm doing house chores . It is very clear and I can listen to any station for different kinds of music . Love it !	1
This app not only offers music stations from all different genres , but also offers sports , news , and talk radio stations . You can also find stations in other countries and in different languages . Such an awesome app ! !	1
I can get every radio station throughout the world that I want , except one . So I 'm happy with this app . And it 's not just canned , internet stations , like Pandora , etc . It 's the actual station in real time !	1
I get to listen to my favorite radio station from another country using this app ! I absolutely love it : ) I can also put my favorite radio station to my favorites list so there is no hassle finding it : )	1
I do enjoy the convenience of having the radio at my fingertips.I can access the stations that I love , and the reception is wonderful.Do n't know why I did n't get it before .	1
works perfect on my kindle fire . I reccomend it . Local . radio sounds great but it wont play some of the international ones but still good app .	1
Listened to local radio stations while a couple thousand miles away on the Kindle fire HD.A basic page of stations by genre , and yup , there was WXRT for news and tunes from home while a long way away . This is a smart cure for homesick travelers , you who are on the road ( thanks CS & N ; ) and students jonesin ' for a favorite station or sound . LOVE ! ! !	1
This was a great deal and I see that it works great ! I would use this all the time if I listened to the radio more	1
Tune In Radio has been a blessing . I have it on my phone and Kindle . I cant sleep with out it . The selections are great . Its usability is wonderful for people like me who do not use i-products . My Grammy loved the stations and it eased her time in the hospital . If you cant find something that interests you on this tuner ... frankly it doesnt exist .	1
I love that I can listen to radios from Argentina with an awesome quality . I definitely recommend it to every one . it makes me feel like I am there .	1
i put this on my ipod and i love it now i can listen to my music everywhere i go	1
Dig it .	1
Look up local radio stations or other radio stations in other states or counties . Get the Pro edition for the ability to download any sound during live play .	1
With this app , you can listen to thousands of radio stations all over the world . If you enjoy listening to radio online , an absolute must to get it . A very good chance you can find your favorite station .	1
I 've had the most fun just exploring all the stations . There are so many from all over the world . Over the air as well as lots of internet only stations . If you like anything radio ; music , talk , discussion , or just listening to evening drive time radio in London , you 've got to give this app a try .	1
Having used this for various podcasts and Radio files I find it very useful for my own needs and interests a very good app for me !	1
Great way to listen in to football games when you are n't home . I used this to listen to the GA/Kentucky game ! That was impressive for this senior citizen .	1
I love this APP because it lets me listen to the music I like to hear . I think it 's a pretty cool thing .	1
I just love listening to a radio while I am playing a game . There is so many stations to listen to .	1
I love that no matter where you are you get the radio station that you like from you home town . thank you .	1
Grate app ! You can listen to radio stations from anywhere in the world , high quality audio and it is really easy to use .	1
This is awesome totally better than any radio Eva.the best part is you can change it as many times as you wantIt is sooooooooo awesome thank you tune in you guys keep rocking	1
I have it on now for the Christmas Music , I can take it with me anywhere.It was free , but worth buying .	1
I have really enjoyed this app for the last two years . I like that you can set a sleep timer and that you can hear stations around the world .	1
love to listen to NPR now I dont miss an episode , as well as some good old 70 's rock now and then flashbacks I guess to sillier days . Nice app very happy	1
Oddly enough , the stereo in my bedroom can not get a strong radio connection , but now I do n't have to worry about it since I have this awesome app . I just connect my Kindle to my stereo and then tune into my favorite local stations . I also like that it can run in the background while I use my Kindle to surf the internet or use other apps .	1
LOVE , LOVE , LOVE THIS APP ! ! I can tune in to any radio station in the country no matter where I am . Worked great on a long road trip when my car radio could n't pick up a station , just tuned in to TUNEIN and found several stations to listen too while I was driving . Told my family to get this app for there android devices & they all love it also . Works great in airports , on airplanes , trains & in their bathrooms .	1
I do n't think I 've carried a radio in a very long time . This uses your internet to stream most radio stations . Looks like it had most of my local stations plus other content . Looks like you can record with the Pro version which I might try .	1
I use this app to listen to music both locally and internationally . In addition there are exclusive Internet only stations . Almost always you can find it as well as podcast from all over the world . I currently use this app as well as IHeart Radio . Music all day or talk or what ever your into	1
Dad can get baseball at the Casino ! TV at casino ( only go for pops ) does n't play Braves so now he can listen or watch on the kindle - at least get the scores	1
Stations are easy to find . App is easy to use . I would recommend this to anyone debating downloading a radio app .	1
I choose a high rating because you never know what you are going to find.All likes you find something different everytime you tune in.I would recommend this radio .	1
i love have a radiostation on my kindle it is nice to be able to tune into my favorite radio station and not have to be sitting at the computer to do it .	1
I love Tunein Radio ! It helps me stay in touch with SF Bay Area news and information when I am traveling away from home .	1
I love Tunein , it is my favorite online audio streaming app of choice . Favorites , local stations that simulcast to internet , etc . Oh and did I mention it also allows setting up custom streaming channels that are not in the Tunein database yet ? COOL !	1
This app is great ! After you enter all your locals ( sadly , Clear Channel blocks access to MANY local stations in the U.S. ) you can begin listening to and adding in national and international radio stations . So much listening fun ! Love it ! /	1
Where can you find good quality music and trusted news stations like NPR other than on TUNEIN ? This is OUTSTANDING - BOTH quality broadcasting and variety . I LOVE IT ! ! !	1
I love this app . It lets me listen to the radio stations I grew up listening to even tho I am now living a thousand miles away .	1
I love this app . It is amazing and I am going to recommend it to everyone . Thank you app developers ! !	1
This is one of the best Radio apps because it has stations that are not owned by Clear Channel who owns i Heart radio . It also lists i Heart radio station also but the links to those stations are hit and miss . To listen to those stations I recommend getting the i Heart radio app . For all other radio station in the USA and around the world I suggest getting & # 34 ; tune in & # 34 ; radio app .	1
I can get daily Wall Street radio updates and other business channels easily in one place on all my devices . Easy to access .	1
I have tune in radio for my smart phone so I can listen to my beloved Steelers as well as other shows when I ca n't sleep . I had no idea that tune in would work on my kindle . I did notice that despite being plugged in , when I was listening to my kindle , it was unable to fully charge overnight .	1
I installed rad.io on my Kindle Fire and it would n't work no matter what , so I uninstalled it . I installed TuneIn Radio and it worked beautifully right from the start . No problems whatsoever . I highly recommend it .	1
my fav app ! so easy to use and interface is perfect.. if u love music this app is for u.signed Tina from Detroit	1
I am so happy with this app the sound is clear and to be able to hear the stations you enjoy at your fingertips is the best-selling app going .	1
This App is amazing ! You can listen to radio stations from all over the world ( even antarctica ) , A great way to get a glimpse into foreign culture . Best of all , it is free ! Get this App ... you really will not be disappointed .	1
Who needs satellite radio with this application ? Well maybe you do because the interface for TuneIn Radio is clunky.The people who designed the user interface must be mass transit commuters because I 'm convinced they 've never used this in a car before.You have to pull over to use make simple changes in your car . You ca n't do simple stuff quick enough during a red light . I get about 80 % of the way there when the light turns green , then at the next red light you have to start over again . But the radio selection is excellent and the quality is great . I play it through the Blue Tooth on my car radio.I wish it had a BIG Radio Button Feature so that I could change stations easily and a Re-Connect button when I lose a connection.It 's close , real close , to being a great application .	1
it is easy to use ; allows you to listen even international radio stations . the audio quality is really high . TuneIn version for Samsung TV does not recognize some international radio station formats	1
I use this application to catch radio shows from around the world . Great search & amp ; streaming . I like the sleep feature ad well . I can catch Coast to Coast am every night !	1
Works well - is easy to use andwhen you get it you will love it ! Go for it - better than others including I Heart Radio - by far !	1
this app is awesome now I can listen to my fav . music . you can licen to the nearest radio avalable	1
Tried to run this on my Kindle Fire ; kept giving me message that I needed an updated flash player . When I tried to download , there were several selections , but none seemed to match my Kindle Fire settings and the ones I tried to download , did n't make Rhapsody work either . There seemed to be two ways to access Rhapsody ; one took me to all this problem of the download and the other was the pay for it monthly option . I deleted all the downloads & Rhapsody app off my Kindle .	-1
why would you want to get a free app and but then have to pay 10 bucks a month to use it ?	-1
I just wanted a music player for what I already own . This charges you to listen to music that is provided . Dev needs to be more clear about this .	-1
This app was actually very stupid and very boring . Unless I missed something , its nothing but a blank screen with one verse written down . You ca n't really do to much more then read the one small passage . I deleted it after about a week .	-1
Can only play about 5 minutes and then forces closed . It 's a fun game , just frustrating that in the middle of a round , forces close . Please update and fix . Motorola Defy Android 2.2	-1
I just tried this game and the towers need to recharge but I have no idea how to do that I literary tried everybutton then I even went to help and all it all it said was they will need to be recharged so I folly do n't reccomend this .	-1
Never been speechless , but this is how this game leaves me unfortunately . Maybe by version 10 it will get better ? I hope so .	-1
It sucks ! ! The weapons are stuped.Don , t wast your time and your money.Who came up with this game is stuped . Get a life .	-1
Ended up removing this game from my phone . It was n't fun and I could n't figure out how to make the `` cannon '' fire more than once at a target . At least it was free .	-1
Those of you who like tower defense games are likely to enjoy games where creeps get progressively stronger , and towers that are adaptable , upgradeable and offer a variety of armaments . This app does n't offer much - it is a clunky game that lacks finesse , especially in level and unit design.The most frustrating part is that the towers are slow . They fire a single shot , and then take forever to reload . And thats plenty of time for a herd of bubbles to go whizzing by . Not much of a defense . It takes a while to figure out that you need to build and upgrade power stations to recharge your towers so they can fire more than once . The instructions are n't too helpful , either . The touchscreen is also laggy at times , which adds to the frustration.It might be easier to just include a button that lets you wave a white flag and surrender , rather than wait patiently for inevitable annihilation.There are many better TD games out there . This one is mediocre , at best .	-1
My team was on the bubble . Then Joe Lunardi popped it . Thanks a lot Joe for that . NIT here we come .	-1
this is not a good game . do not by it . I mean , really . its terrible . PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
I gave this game a chance and boy was I wrong it 's so stupid . I ca n't believe I wasted some of my 32gb on this game	-1
This is terrible ! Poor graphics and concept is out there , but really better graphica would make it allot better . Perhaps a free app to begin with or if they need money that bad 50 & cent ; . Give me a go theme , calculator , tricorder , script or something .	-1
definitely not worth it , a great waste of time honestly , I was like wtf when I tried it out , and uninstalled immediately	-1
robot defense but less responsive and harder to understand even the easy setting . I hope they fix the bugs , but until they do I can not recommend this game at all !	-1
THE STUPID GUNS FIRE ONE TIME NOT A GOOD GAME DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY . GRRRRR GRRRRRRR GRRRRRR DONT BUY DONT BUY GUNS FIRE ONE TIME GRRRRR . D : & lt ;	-1
I bought this game . I regret that I bought it . do not get it . because it is not good for your gaming device . the game is.so blurry	-1
Waste of a free game on Amazon 's end . Gameplay is garbage , clunky , and did n't make compared to other defense games . Hard to imagine the frustration from those who actually paid for the app . Do n't waste your time even with the free app that Amazon offers , I wasted 20 mins of my life figuring this one out and I can never have that time back .	-1
just like the title says ... its like some 14 year old kids first attempt at an app . there is that and the fact that it is a total rip off of bloons which is totally worth buying	-1
For everyone saying the towers only fire once , you need to learn how the game works . One of the first things the game tells you is that you need a power station . That is a poor concept , and without the power station your towers only fire once . The power station & quot ; recharges & quot ; your towers , but ca n't handle a lot of them unless you upgrade the station . I gave it a one star for no sound , poor instructions , no real options menu , the use of a & quot ; power station & quot ; that costs a much as a basic tower and is required , and really for just being a bad game.To the devs , if you are going to force the player to use a power station for the towers either lower the cost or raise the amount of gold players start with .	-1
this is the first time I give an app a one star rating , and the first time I can actually say it 's not even worth the free download . unbelievable ! The worst & quot ; game & quot ; I 've ever come across !	-1
This app accesses your phone number , like Skype or Google Voice . Verified with Privacy Blocker . 1 star for privacy invasion and lack of disclosure .	-1
I & apos ; m offended by the fact that they would try to charge people $ 4 normally for something that isn & apos ; t as good as many free apps . Does it work ? Sure , but , for example , Carrr Matey is a much more enjoyable app and it & apos ; s always free .	-1
I had high hopes for this application , but it is hard to use and doesn & apos ; t quite work right . Holding it the way it described made it very hard to see the screen due to glare of the sun . Also , the radar doesn & apos ; t work right ; it doesn & apos ; t face the right direction ( it thought I was facing North when I was really facing West ) . All in all , I am not going to rely on it .	-1
I have tried to use this app several times and it has not once successfully located my car . Totally worthless . The last time it said my car was 42km away when I was standing next to it .	-1
there is absolute no reason for this application fee or not ... not on my phone . Hey dev ... I think you need to think about	-1
Too many unnecessary permissions are needed for this App . There is no reason they need your personal data to manage your locations .	-1
This app only works with friends if they have it too . With that said , Google Latitude is better because Latitude is free ( & amp ; more people have Google accounts ) .	-1
I did not install as well . way too many permissions for something I can do on google maps . Dev . thanks for the app but I won & apos ; t install until you explain the permissions .	-1
the sensitivity adjustments on this game Suck . Does n't make much sense to get stuck behind a rock wall . And to put and have the ball bounce off the pin , over and over again Sucks . This AP is a rip off .	-1
I love how this app shows me the guide for cable since my new provider does n't offer a channel guide.The only problem is the in app ads . They are huge and take up half of the screen . I tried to find a way to pay to eliminate the ads but there is no way.I am very disappointed . I think I 'll look for another channel guide app .	-1
used to use this a lot but for some reason cant locate my zipcode ! ! ! I uninstalled & amp ; reinstalled it -- - hmmm cant locate Los Angeles CA	-1
I spent a lot of time entering my channels by filtering them only to have it do an update and lose all my preferences . I 'll be removing it from my Kindle HDX . Thanks anyway .	-1
This app does n't have my cable provider ... & gt ; 8 [ TV Guide app does . I need more words before I can submit my review . Geesh , I still need more ...	-1
It is to & # 34 ; linear & # 34 ; ... i.e . guide is not layed out in a grid format . I prefer to use the online grid supplied by DISH Network . where I can see several hours and about 10 channels on the same screen grid . I removed it from my Kindle Fire .	-1
This is a very good app . Yes it is ad-supported , but the app is well worth using even with the ads . You enter your ZIP Code , pick your television provider , and boom - TV Listings . For further control , you can filter only the channels you want to see listed and move to any time of day you wish . I use this quite regularly , it is way quicker than watching the TV Guide channel and this app is far superior to the TV Guide official app ( which is pretty bloated ) .UPDATE December 2 2013 : The latest version of this app is severely crippled by a bug . You can filter out channels that you do n't want to see in the listings , but the app forgets the channels you have filtered every time you launch it . To me , this severely decreases the usefulness of the app . I 'll be looking for an alternative .	-1
I had this app and loved it . It was a nice simple to use tv guide . They updated it and changed the format a little with some added information . Now I keep getting an error message stating I do not have an internet connection . Well I do have a good connection , everything else works fine . I can even enter the app store and give the updated version a terrible review . Please fix the problem or give us back the previous edition that worked .	-1
Set up was quick and easy but it had the listings in the wrong time zone . I uninstalled it and re-installed it , and it was still incorrect . My cable company is small , and although this app had it listed as a choice , it did not have the correct information for the television show listings .	-1
what 's the point of downloading this app if u can just check your Tv guide ? Also u cant c any Tv shows . ur only seeing Tv listings . I dont like this app .	-1
I get 24 OTA channels , this app only shows 5 of those channels . No thanks , deleted it . Needs to show all the channels .	-1
Loved it at first , flawless ... then when advised it was update time , well , it would n't ! Would not update properly , even tried uninstall/reinstall routine . No help ... sent 2 emails to developers but no response either !	-1
I have a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 . This app has some nice features and one that does n't work for me . Under Settings I should be able to `` Filter channels '' so that I can scroll through only those channels in which I am interested instead of all 542 of them ( similar to the Comcast Favorites feature ) . This feature works for a while then loses my input and I am back to scrolling through 542 channels . I 'll put this app on the back burner until they get this issue resolved .	-1
i 've had this app for a couple of years and loved it but now it does n't show any but ads ! ! no tv listings show at all evrn ehen i verified the channel settings were correct . deleting this horrible app !	-1
I have n't uninstalled it yet , but its slow.I have yet to figure out how the search works , but it is n't terribly obvious.I want to pare down the channels displayed to the ones I typically watch - I 'm not interested in the non-HD broadcast channels , nor yhe premium channels I do n't get . I 'm also nointerested in anything being excreted by Fox Noise .	-1
App loaded fine for few uses , afterwards , it would only display a message that no info is available . I uninstalled from both phones , Samsung Galaxy and LG . Loved the format and ease of use . unfrotunately , it was unreliable .	-1
it is a lot of fun but it is a lot harder than it should be . cant pass level 3 on easy .	-1
The gave had decent graphics and a nice upgrade system . The controls are bad . You can do motion but the response is slow out hand and then you can & apos ; t see the ship	-1
I downloaded this for my Asus tablet and the accelerometer and touch screen controls weren & apos ; t very good . My ship kept bouncing up and down like a low rider .	-1
I was interested in this game , but unfortunately I 'm still using the original Motorola Droid and ca n't afford the space . I wish the developers were more sensitive to space issues ... we need the ability to move apps to the SD ram .	-1
I ordered the game , played it once , and got bored . I do n't remember exactly why I did n't like it , but I deleted it from my collection .	-1
it realy is not worth it , just suck it up and buy a better version . i love spider solitare but do n't really mess with this one	-1
I found that it would lock up and that there were no clear backup key or directions to be found .	-1
Maybe but I 'm not convinced . I happen to like Honeycomb 's standard interface more than dxTop 's but that 's a matter of taste . Objectively , the scope of this app - take near-complete control of my desktop ( and yes , it comes with custom icons and themes ) - was enough of a concern for me to remove it shortly after installation . I asked myself how other , more modest add-ons would perform while dxTop was in charge and I find the answer quickly . `` Application Folder Pro '' , my favorite folder organizer was unusable under the new management . Others apps and widgets may be preempted but that 's as far as my investigation went.If accepted as the alternative interface , the app is deep and complex enough to demand quite a substantial time investment but that would be okay if the rewards justified the effort . In my case ( XOOM , Honeycomb ) they do n't . I was n't able to justify allowing a `` vendor 's '' app to make phone calls on my behalf without me knowing it , just to mention one of the more intrusive rights you grant the app as you install it . And , on a more parochial note , dxTop was stuck in 'portrait ' on my XOOM . There may be some setup option that might change that to 'auto-rotate ' but I removed dxTop before I found it.For 'positives ' , this does appear to be a well-thought , well-designed overlay but it 's a radical departure from Android 's way of interacting with the end-user so one of the first questions that popped into my mind was : if they believe that Android 's interface deserves to be so completely wiped out , why not produce their own mobile OS ? Seriously.In the Android world what I need and in fact I welcome at this time is 'helpers ' such as 'App Folder Pro ' , not a new boss . dxTop tries to make itself the boss and I have not use for that .	-1
Nice diamond concept but I like the original home screens for the DROID x . This is not as intuitive for me .	-1
It 's not really a bad app for free but it makes my fascinate run VERY very slow ... will probably end up uninstalling	-1
it ran slower than stock on droid 2 , loaded the menu slower , and not to crazy about the look . seemed plain looking to me . running droid 2 on 2.2 , and its not rooted .	-1
I have an HTC phone , so I already have all these features with Sense . Not an attractive interface . Functions smoothly .	-1
I have nothing against it . It 's only a launcher . I just prefer to use ADW.. It is fairly stable on my phone . But I just do n't like the way it works .	-1
The Launcher is nothing spectacular , It does n't let you use your own widgets . it removed all of the ones I was using and it could not re add the two widgets that I want to use which was Blizzards Real ID and Fancy Widget pro.The screen is slow to respond on my inspire , and I did n't like that the home screen was now CLEAR to the right and not in the center of their cross setup . Also I gave this link to a friend of mine with an atrix , which has duel cores and a bigger active memory base , he says it also slows down his entire device . so clearly they need to do some heavy optimization.The Lock screen mimic 's the iPhone lock screen , which again is very slow to response and feels clunky and slow to respondThe one touch application menu in the center is a pretty slick idea.The addition of instant access to your Text messaging program is pretty cool , but it ' not really setup for customizationIt has potential but it has a hell of a long way to go to get there.I 'm giving this two stars because it has possibilities and some rather interesting ideas , nothing terrible innovative or remarkable . It just needs work .	-1
I tried this despite some poor reviews , but deleted it right away . I did n't like anything it did to my phone . It did n't slow like some said . No thank you . Droid X .	-1
Can not pick up any police , rescue , or fire in my area . I was very disappointed ! Hope they soon get an app that will pick up fire and rescue and police in my actual county or city !	-1
the product was alright . I was hoping it would have some closer stations to me . but it did n't but overall i think its a good product that can get the station they need	-1
apparently it must not be compatible with this tablet it said it was purchased but could not find it on the tablet	-1
Um at first I used it for a while but , then I started not to use it quite as much as before & now it just seems to pretty much sit there in my tablet computer | [	-1
While this app might be useful in major cities , it is n't at all useful in small towns . The audio streams are from voluntary sources , it is NOT like having a real scanner receiver .	-1
i would like to have the city i live in on here . is there a way to add or what ? someone please help . the city is elmira ny , if that helps	-1
It is not what I expectedit does not function as advertised , not for me anyhowno matter the time or place there is emptiness .	-1
Do n't use it . Could n't get anything too clear . Depends on where you live I suppose . Someone else would have better luck .	-1
battery and usage drain on my cell phone mobile phone . Thid app scanner radio will drain your battery and scanner radio will use up your allowable mobile phone data usage .	-1
Sorry could not write a review , did not keep it long enogh to rate this product.I think I 'll stay away from the scanner radios .	-1
Could n't find my county did n't have good stations that I even wanted I ended up toke it off my device	-1
Do not get this scanner application , it does not receive the stations I was looking for . Glad it was free , have deleted it of the device and the cloud .	-1
Some apps are good , some bad , some work , some do not ! I do/did not like this app because I want a scanner for my town , not a town that is 30,40 or 50 miles away ! ! !	-1
I had a hard time finding something for my area and when I did , very static and broken up . Maybe would be fine in a different area .	-1
The reason I am only giving this app 2stars is because I ca n't get access to scanning anywhere near my area	-1
Set it for my area and have never worked no matter how many times Ive downloaded and deleted it then reloaded it . Sucks !	-1
do n't waste your time downloading . there is nothing on here . I heard a bunch of weird noises coming from it but that was it . Maybe I 'm way out of range but I just did n't see the point of keeping it . I uninstalled it as fast as I could .	-1
will not connect to anything even on wifi no local in city not out n sticks has trains but y listion to them talk	-1
I was unable to access anything on this app . Maybe I just do n't understand how it works , but even for free , I dumped it .	-1
I got this to try to keep track of all the fire trucks that go by and get absolutely nothing . Tried to change directions and frequency but get no audio at all .	-1
Nothing in California . At least not in Sacramento or the surrounding area . They are supposed to be expanding , but I listened to other areas for fun and found it to be very poor sound quality .	-1
Good enough for someone who wants it for `` amateur '' reasons , but it is to laggy for me as a professional to use as a third radio frequency .	-1
I live in a major metropolitan area and this program does not connect to anything in my area . I have try it a few times but to me it is useless .	-1
It is useless . I could not get my local police on here . All I got was static and if you do n't live in a big city just forget it .	-1
I could n't find transmission of signals in my local area . I suppose otherwise this would be OK but for me it was n't worth it .	-1
I did not like this app at all . The scanner hardly picked up anything- even when I switched channels . This app is not for me .	-1
This so-called radio was a piece of junk . poor quality and lousy sound ... not even what I would expect from the chinese these days .	-1
I thought when I got this that I can hear what was going on around my neighborhood but it did n't allow that .	-1
I gave it a 2 star because it not much use for me . I ca n't get any stations around my area . Not very interesting .	-1
I was banned for using a word found in the bible , and the next day in the Boston chat room for calling someone a racist after they said they hoped the bombers are white guys . The help page uses an inapropriate vulgar word as an example of what not to say .	-1
Was expecting something more like one you 'd buy at the store think I was expecting to much for free it may work for others but not for me try it for yourself and see how it works out in your area good luck also do n't like the idea of being told how many words I have to use in my review of any item	-1
I was so excited to try this out but the only way I could have access to what I wanted , I found I had to pay . So much for free .	-1
I down loaded this and waited and waited for it to come up with something . I know things were going on as my husband has a scanner in the garage . I got & # 34 ; nothing & # 34 ; ! Will probably take off my Kindle HD Fire .	-1
I loved this app ... until the last update . When opened , the home screen is visable , but frozen . Its completely unresponsive . I will try erasing the app and downloading it again , but I wo n't allow the update this time . This app quite large , which is rate annoying and seems unnecessary but , in my opinion , worth it if you can get it to work correctly . Using a Samsung Epic Galaxy .	-1
I have not been able to read a book since the new version loaded on my Android phone . The books I already had downloaded to my device would n't open and neither would new books . I 'm stuck in a cycle of downloading to device and then being told I have to remove them and download them again . HELP ! ! ! I see I 'm not the only one with this issue .	-1
Maybe most people do n't care , but I read reviews.Update ddoes n't allow you to read reviews just shows the average ratings I freaking hate this , have to look for books on the browser now .	-1
I used to like Kindle . The app was fast and reliable , and made it easy to read an ebook from Amazon on my Nook Color ( with N2A ) .Then I bought a couple of new Kindle books , and Kindle ( the app ) would not download them unless I updated the app . The new app starts with a gray sphere and freezes there for a long time . Then it loads , and the default screen is not my library but the Kindle store with recommendations . A few buttons later I finally get to select my book and read it . Meanwhile , the app still does n't allow you to group the books by topic.This spells the end of Kindle for me . I 'll move my books over to Calibre , which does n't try to sell anything and does allow for sorting books .	-1
Comics wo n't open to full zoom so ca n't read them , pages turn to quick and messed up slightest touch does something almost everytime , no room for errors here . Not a fan , but try it maybe you 'll have better luck .	-1
I have had the kindle app for yrs . Now ca n't download it from Amazon or play store . Can anyone tell me why ? I 've been reading a book but now ca n't find it.EDIT : Right after I wrote this review the app downloaded . Now a happy camper ! ! ! ! !	-1
I used to love this app to read my Kindle books on my phone , As soon as I downloaded the updates the app does n't work at all , the error message says it failed . Very disappointed.If you have n't updated the app yet , do n't ! !	-1
I have a Nabi.Downloaded it to read ebooks . I was SO excited . Got going , downloaded samples , got hooked , went to purchase the full book to continue on and ... . the books I wanted were suddenly uncompatable with my device .	-1
NO Password Protection - One Click Always ON ! ! I email Amazon and they replied `` at this time , the password feature is not available on Kindle app for Android '' . That is a terrible way to do business . It is very shady to try to get people to constantly buy things buy accident . They demand card information and then offer no protection once the app is on you phone or tablet . Anyone ( including my children just trying to read their chapter book for school ) could buy books accidentally . What a shady business strategy ! I am VERY disappointed in you Amazon . I expected better from you . This is shameful exploitation of loyal customers .	-1
No way to get kindle format ( azw ) for my aoson keeps crashing no support to get help for this.. really suck 's now I really refuse to buy those kindle books	-1
I have a tin of books on the android version bought a fire where 's my books ? It would seem this app does not work on the fire . Very disappointing .	-1
Amazon , I 've always loved my kindle . I still love my kindle . But the phone app preinstalled with no sign of upgrade or remedy crashes constantly , bringing up an annoying box I have to close.. In the middle of whatever I do . I did n't open the app , I did n't strain it 's capabilities.. I could n't even download a book I own .. Or even my library titles the only time I ever tried to use you weeks ago . What gives ? ? ? ? ? Please figure it out and get back to being my reading companion .	-1
I ca n't get any of my books to open on this . I see them , I download them to the device , but no text . Not happy .	-1
I have been trying to install this app on my Galaxy Tab 2 so I can transfer my book to a single and it will not . I do n't know if the problem is with the Galaxy , I have not been able to get with their customer reps , or with the Kindle app itself .	-1
I find I go to the 'Table of Contents ' often to reread a chapter or go to a favorite chapter . I was also using a Kindle Bible in church to quickly jump to the 'Table of Contents ' then to the chapter ( Book ) I wanted . After this last update there is no '2 touch ' go to contents any more . In fact the `` Table of Contents '' in the menu will not even take you to a 'Table of Contents ' . To change books in the Bible I have to:1. go to the menu2 . choose Navigation3 . from there I can choose 'Table of Contents'4 . choose book5 choose chapterBy then it is too late . Other books do n't have a `` Navigation '' choice . How about a 'Go to 'Table of Contents ' ' in the 'Table of Contents ' tab ... come on this is common sense . Why even call it 'Table of Contents ' if it does not take you there .	-1
I used to love having kindle for android in my phone , but since the last update my phone and kindle account go crazy every time I try to use it . It 's creating multiple accounts for the same phone on Amazon ( nine accounts last time I checked ) , wo n't undo the update , shots down on its own if it opens at all , and freezes my phone . Amazon , do something !	-1
Forcing me to sign in and reload books daily . Amazon saids its a issue with the Galaxy S3 with Jelly Bean , with no idea of a fix . Overseas call center is useless and ca n't speak enough English to understand . Very disappointed , I 've used app for many years with no issues on many phones .	-1
These may seem like minor , insignificant complaints to you , and they would be if there were any legal alternative to the Kindle app . Unfortunately , when I buy an ebook on Amazon , I 'm locked in to their apps/devices , so I ca n't read the book the way I want . Amazon is n't doing me a favor by making an ebook app that works for me , they owe it to me.Margins : When I read a physical book , there are reasonable margins . When I read a DRM-free ebook on a feature-rich open source e-reader app on my galaxy tab , I have reasonable margins between the edge of the screen and the edge of the tablet . When I read a Kindle ebook on the Kindle app on my galaxy tab , I have EXTRA LARGE margins in portrait mode thanks to the built in , non-configurable software margins . When I tilt the tablet a few degrees too far to the right or left ( surprisingly easy to do when you have the tablet tilted back a little ) , I get EXTRA LARGE margins on the top and bottom of the screen , and DELUXE SUPER JUMBO margins on the right and left.Screen Rotation : On my phone , the Kindle app is great . The software margins are n't an issue since my phone does n't have built in margins around the screen , and I can tell the Kindle app not to change orientations when I tilt the phone by pressing a mysterious lock icon that appears when I tilt it . On my tablet , the Kindle app team has decided that users do n't like locking the screen rotation , so they 've completely removed that feature . They say that it 's easy to lock the screen rotation in Android 3.0 , but it 's actually only one click less to lock the screen in Android 3.0 than to lock it in Android 2.X , plus there 's the fact that I do n't want to have to enter Kindle App Mode every time I try to read a Kindle ebook.The only reason I 'm giving it two stars rather than one is because the Kindle app is still at least twice as good as the Barnes and Noble Nook app , for what it 's worth .	-1
The quality of the audio is excellent - selection process is impossible.Ca n't figure out how to turn off the station that is streaming . Ca n't figure out how to search for particular radio stations - the station call letters do not produce the desired station . Lists of stations , songs etc . not in alphabetical or numeric order . Profuse disorganization ! Very unfriendly user interface - at least for this attempting user . No apparent help available explaining how to maneuver the app . I give up !	-1
Downloaded to my RAZR Maxx HD . Seems to work but have other similar apps that are much better . Already uninstalled .	-1
An internet radio app doesnt need to run at startup , and & quot ; send sticky broadcasts & quot ; has been documented by an Android OS developer as something he regrets was made public.Do a Google search on these words to read his comments : regretting sticky broadcast public	-1
I down loaded this app when it was free . I thought I would use it . However , I did not . Was n't my thing and I could n't figure it out . I deleted it .	-1
actually & quot ; Kay & quot ; it in fact says & quot ; find your favorite local radio stations & quot ; . not sure what description you read . you might want to re-read something before you try to quote it .	-1
Being the App of the day I thought it could n't hurt to try . Like another user , apps started to crash . I have a Note ll and everything was running smooth and fine . I removed it last week and now my Note is back to normal . Bottom line , stay away .	-1
this app was ok at first then even when my kindle is turned off it went on when I tried to turn it off it would not work , thus I had no option but to delete it .	-1
Keeps telling me that I need internet access then immediately exits . My 4G LTE connection is FINE . That , plus the stupid permissions mentioned , motivates me to uninstall and enjoy tune in pro , which also allows recording and has multiple timer settings .	-1
There was not much to the game . you touched a water ball and it broke up and hopefully hit the other water balls so they would touch other and on and on . This is a good game for 1st graders on down .	-1
I hated it it was crap do n't get it.jk Jk jk jk JKJK.it was good I recommend it for people entertained easily	-1
Good teaching game . Try and beat the Cpu , test different stratagies . I enjoy this game . Game offers the different skill levels to try and improve ones skills .	-1
It is a good thing this game is free ! I would have asked for my money back if not . Do not waste you time !	-1
First the game plays true then it cheats once the cube is doubled it throws doubles and manages to throw just what it needs for kills . I 've played Backgammon for over 40 years I know a cheat when I see it !	-1
Despite AI 's claim to the contrary , this program cheats . I 've had this one day , played maybe 10 games , and every time I 've put it on the bar it gets out on the first roll . One game it got out three times in a row when I had four covered . And it was n't the same spot open every time . The 6/1 , 3/1 , 4/2 rolls to start the game for them and the 6/2 , 6/3 rolls for me are quite regular , too . And guess how often those open pips get hit ... . Prepare to be frustrated , like with every other computer version you 've played . At least it was free .	-1
Only because I ca n't figure how to play ! My daughter in law loves it ! So , I keep it on my tablet for her !	-1
Having played backgammon on my laptop , I really was not impressed with this one.Found it hard to follow . Needless to say i have deleted it from my kindle fire	-1
I love word search puzzles so i figured i would give this one a try . It is another one of those games that are good for children , but is entirely way too simple and small for adults that like to really use their brain .	-1
This game is impossible to play . Ive tried changing the settings but it dont work . I love playing rl back gammon sobthis was a big dissapointment	-1
The more I played this game , the more often the Ai opponent started rolling doubles nearly every single roll ! ! ! How can you compete with that ? ? And not only that , the doubles were the number it could use the most to maximize moves towards a win ! I 'm sorry to say , but I honestly believe there is a flaw in the game that favors the device when in single player mode . If the rolls were more random , or the gameplay were more 'fair ' , It would definately get a higher score from me , but not the way it is . Also , one othe thing a LOT OF DEVELOPERS IGNORE ; AN EXIT BUTTON ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I 'm not a developer/programmer , but how hard can it be ? Too bad about all this , I love Backgammon ! I read some of the other reviews and most people ( as I do ) that the dice are loaded . The roll should be as random as you can possibly make them concidering the limitations of programming . The differences should be where the AI decides to move the game pieces , leaving more open , or not , depending on the level . The dice rolls should ALWAYS BE RANDOM and have the same probability for both players . This would be the way it happens in real life with two people playing a real game . If the game ever gets updated to reflect better play conditions , my rating will go up .	-1
if you just want to feel guilty about what youre eating , this app is great . however , if you want to know the actual caloric content of what youre eating , this app is a waste . it lacks many selections and key features , and the data that it does have doesnt even jive with the internet	-1
Very very very disappointing that this app does not count calories as it claims . Hopefully someday in the future it will be updated to include this KEY feature . But until then , the developer can count 2 stars .	-1
Only used the app a few times . What seemed pretty cool ( which I got for free app day ) was n't too helpful at all . All the numbers are kind of in a really bland and un-aesthetically pleasing format . I do n't really care for the app much at all , so I uninstalled it from my phone , but it 's still there on the amazon appstore just in case I want to download it again .	-1
I hate to say it , but I really expected more from a ( normally ) paid app . The list of restaurants is disappointingly short and there does n't seem to be a way to add up menu items for a grand total . The app is called calorie counter , but it does n't count anything . It simply allows you to pick a restaurant , look at a list of menu items , and touch each item to see its nutritional values . No pictures , no way to add up the various items to total up the meal , no way to keep track of your history to try to reduce calorie intake and raise protein intake ... nothing particularly useful.This was most disappointing when looking at the list of ingredients at chipotle . It lists out the tortillas , chips , salsa , meat , cheese , beans ... etc . But no way to build the burrito or plate to know what you 're about to eat . I am not a developer , but there is no way this feature would be difficult to add.Lastly , I should be able to enter my calorie intake goals and be able to see where most of my calories come from . Without this feature , it is just an app full of raw data . I am almost certain that I can find all of this information on a single website if I googled it . I really got my hopes up on this app and I ca n't believe anyone would pay $ 3 for this raw and freely available information.This app has potential to be extremely useful . Most of my meals come from local restaurants . Add these features and I might just pull out my phone for something other than words with friends during my meal .	-1
out of the available chains i only have one ! where is Mcdonalds ? ? ? KFC ? Wendy 's ? Taco Bell ? Baja Fresh ? free apps are really sucking	-1
I expected a lot more . Not sure if thats because other calorie counting apps have set the bar so high , or because this one is just that bad . The list of restaurants is extremely short . The app does n't look like anything special , considering the dev 's want money for it . It lacks so many features , features that every other app of this category have . There should be some sense of customizing meals . Even if they did n't go above and beyond , selecting 1 standard size for each item is ridiculous . Some of these fast food sites even let you build your meal and see the totals . Honestly , this is a poor excuse for a calorie counting app . Do n't waste your time.Phone : Droid X ( Android 2.2.1 , Liberty 2.0.1 )	-1
There is no way I would have paid for this app . It 's missing tons of places . Does n't do any more than free apps of the same kind would . No wonder it 's free .	-1
Had to delete because it would not load properly ! Guess I will have to hunt for another app to spell check .	-1
This seamed like a good app . But i had to delete it because my kindle does not come with voice recognition .	-1
This was a really terrible yahtzee game . How can you ruin Yahtzee ? But they succeeded in doing so . Do n't bother .	-1
permissions needed for a simple dice game ? I do n't like how the advertising is located conveniently too close to the & quot ; roll & quot ; bar , the dice ( as you try to highlight them ) , and the options tab at the bottom of the screen . I have accidentally hit the ad countless times and had to back out numerous . times in the middle of a game . ( KFire ) I also dislike that extra 5 of a kind can not be counted as a score for a full house.iI give it 2 stars because the actual gameplay is pretty quick.Going to uninstall to see if I ca n't find one I like better , or at least one that does n't have gameplay functions literally on top of ad links . I got a FAR better Yahtzi game on a CD out of a cereal box !	-1
PARENTS BEWARE THIS GAME IS STUPID DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS STUPID APP ALL YOU DO IS PARK AND PARK AND IT WILL GET BORING AND YOU WILL OFFICIALLY HATE IT DO NOT GET THIS APP ! !	-1
color good . graphics move smoothly but it does not work on my Samsung Instinct 2.2 android OS . i have a small screen . maybe this game is made for bigger newer phones 2.3 android maybe	-1
These permissions are absolutely above and beyond what is required . There is no reason why a simple game application needs to read the state of my phone , and CERTAINLY not the id of my calls . Stay far away !	-1
Unblock me is better . This game is weak . Much better versions out there . Graphics are cool though . I only give it 2.5 stars .	-1
To those concerned about downloading apps and becoming victims of data mining businesses , I 've listed what this developer was asking for on Market vs. the `` dog and pony show version '' you 're now downloading on Amazon ( THAT WILL SURELY BE UPDATED sometime after FAOTD when the developer feels you 've already trusted his app , are not paying close attention , and are `` simply updating '' for some other minor bug fix ) .Permisssions the developer submitted in his AMAZON FAOTD version : ( the version you are considering downloading ... for NOW ) * Read only access to phone state . * Write to external storage . * Open network sockets . * Access information about Wi-Fi networks . * Access the vibration feature . * Access information about networks.The STANDARD permissions the developer currently asks for in his MARKET version : ( NOTE : for both PAID & FREE Market versions identical , and only FREE version has `` ads '' ) * Network communication - full Internet access - Allows an application to create network sockets . * Phone calls - read phone state and identity - Allows the application to access the phone features of thedevice . An application with this permission can determine the phone number and serial number of thisphone , whether a call is active , the number that call is conncted to and the like . * Storage - modify/delete USB storage contents modify/delete SD card contents - Allows an application towrite to the USB storage . Allows an application to write to the SD card . * Hardware controls - control vibrator - Allows the application to control the vibrator . * Network communication - view network state - Allows an application to view the state of all networks . * view Wi-Fi state - Allows an application to view the information about the state of Wi-Fi . ( network comm . ) Anyone who looks at the Market versions can clearly see those permissions are way out of wack to run a `` car version '' of the Block Me game , especially the Market 's PAID version . The developer wants ALL those permissions in BOTH free and paid versions , so in the paid version , you 're paying for `` more game '' and not `` less/no ads . '' The developer clearly does n't care about giving you more `` game '' for the money , because he has no intention of changing the unbelievably invasive permissions that are the poster child for data mining.Now the developer faces Amazon . He knows asking for your phone 's ID and serial number and a list of all the numbers of who you call , and who called you , are going to pop right out to Amazon reviewers as the BIG CLUE that he is data mining . So he takes it out ... . but he leaves in the others and hopes those permissions gets defended as necessary for that wonderful `` leaderboard action '' and `` rate this app '' and `` notify me of bugs '' stuff , as so many unknowing Amazon reviewers DO have a habit of doing to justify keeping the free app they do n't want to part with.READ THE PERMISSIONS YOURSELF and YOU decide how the developer makes a living off this app , what he did to get onto Amazon FAOTD , what all those permissions on the Amazon version add up to ( even WITHOUT the phone serial number request ) , why phone information is wanted by the developer on all other versions but this Amazon one ( for now ) , and what he 'll likely do to update YOUR app once he 's out of the Amazon spotlight.If you doubt the developer will add the phone stuff back , just go right here on Amazon and look at any of the other 16 apps this developer put out here , for instance the `` paid '' version of Bubble Popper . The permission for the phone is IN there , even in that PAID version.P.S . Misspellings in an app itself realllllllly get me nervous as to who is developing these apps and why , especially considering the massive phone ID serial numbers theft originating from Asia . Why they ca n't get or do n't want an English-speaking American to look it over first before marketing to America makes me cock my eyebrow in a BIG way .	-1
This game is exactly like UnblockMe ( which has well over 1000 levels and is free ) and RushHour ( which already incorporated cars , only with better animations and was available as faotd a while back ) ...	-1
this is a terrible product . I purchased this and when it arrived not only was the box ripped but inside the box was a 100 year old sock .	-1
Why does this app need to get your phone call information ? Do n't install . A a a a a a a	-1
Not fun	-1
This program consists of about six single-screen puzzles , each with a few variations . After about 10 minutes of play they begin to repeat . As you move through the games there is no escalation in difficulty or any apparent attempt to select the `` next '' puzzle based on previous puzzles or the child 's success at solving them.In our case my 4-year old daughter got bored even before the first sequence was completed . A little ways after the puzzles began to repeat she closed the app and wanted to watch a movie.On the plus side , this app is `` solid '' ( no bugs and with a finished appearance ) . It also does *not* need any kind of Internet connection to run . ( Some reviewers said it did and I expect they may have been using an earlier version . ) Finally , it runs just fine on my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet.In summary , it is good for at least one fairly short sitting .	-1
Cute idea- downloaded for my 3 and /or 5 year old - thing is ... there is no variety so they become bored very quickly . There are different activities , yes , simple puzzle , colors , letters and a few more - however you can not pick what you want to play as they are randomly set up and delivered in groups of 5-6 games or so per round of play -after each round you get a little sticker to place on a board - stickers are cute and fun idea - however they are not saved ( no option ) and you start with blank board each time you begin play -- would have been better if u could keep the stickers in a little album or something . - After about 5 rounds of playing I noticed games were repeating , after about 10 rounds my daughter noticed - just not enough variety or options for a paid app - or an app for kiddos with minimal attention spans ! ! ! I use on Kindle Fire and as with other reviews I read I do not have to be connected to Wifi to play- can play in car , on the go no prob .	-1
I have n't caught any so called & quot ; ghosts & quot ; yet but I think this app is pretty crappy SORRY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I just do n't like apps that might scare the macaroni out of people !	-1
I think this game sucks so do n't waste your time buying it.it said the word handle I 'm like this is dumb . scary but dumb	-1
its alright..maybe . fun prank for sleep oversea but when it & quot ; picks up & quot ; something..it says ramndom words likemilk & amp ; guide ... like what does that even mean ? ?	-1
Not exactly what I wanted . Looking for something to have fun with Grandkids . Just a low tech toy for kids .	-1
this game is so stupid it does n't even tel u wat to do I do n't get it all it is is a bug circle that just spins and a dot shows up apparently that is the ghost and u have ti tap it apparently that gets rid of the ghosts	-1
at first I was begging my dad for this app and when he finnally said yes I got it and it did n't even tell me which way to go to get it it ducks I hare it I cant beleive I wasted my time on this app	-1
I downloaded this and it came up with things like 'AWESOME ' '0KAY ' and other no-nonsense words . deleted it as much time as it took to load .	-1
it is completely fake because i got it no ghosts no words just fake i cant believe i read all the reviews got it and nothing just BORING ! !	-1
it 's kind of boring . it just ... well ... does ... . not much . when I first played it , it worked well , and I liked it . now , not so much . it gets really , and I mean really , boring after a while . I deleted it ...	-1
The app Ghost Radar was a complete waste . Unless you are a real believer in ghosts , do not I REPEAT , do not download this app . I was watching Star Trek and my Ghost Radar said & quot ; CLOTHING & quot ; which I thought was weird , and I saw nothing that resembled clothing . Also , my battery got hot really fast . I do n't believe in ghost . I just thought it would be funny and creepy . Overall , do not download this app .	-1
This app is stupid , you stare at a circle and then it says some random words . That 's all people ! Come on , admit it , this app is stupid .	-1
This app sucks monkey balls . It does n't even work I tried it and it was nada . Defiantly not kindle fires . My friend Lavender says that she tried it with my kindle and it sucked . DONT BUY TURN BACK WIL YOU CAN ! ! !	-1
this game is so stupid all it does is show u a bunch of lines . wow exciting ! NOT ! ! ! ! it does not even show anything on the radar ever . truly suckish .	-1
Total waste of time ! Sure , I do n't expect catching ghosts with it , but I 'd expect some entertainment out of it . And with that mindset , I rate this app total crap ! Hope I quit the app fast enough that it did n't con the advertiser in the ad banner !	-1
Looks cool with all the lights and such but never tells you what you are seeing , how it is possibly picking things up ... just an odd idea for an ereader or a phone .	-1
I got this and it was just for fun . I tried it and at first no red dots . Then a red dot appeared . I was with my sis and so freaked out . All it said was V a million times in the corner . I was so freaked and deleted it . Now downloading it again	-1
im confused on this wierd app . it says things and tries to scare u. nothing happened so far that it said . its just , not the best app ... at all . it is alittle ... .alot ... .creepy	-1
It 's fake . His name is Johnathan and it says random words for a minute I thought it was real but it is n't . Random words pop up and the dots disappear ? ? ! ! Do n't get it its a scam ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Beleave me its fake do n't buy it ! !	-1
if u r a scaredy cat and cant handle scary stuff do n't get it.it is that simple I seriously do n't get why people think its fun to be scared I mean like you are worried what 's going happen just live your life with a clean diaper Ps I think all you horror movie makers are sick and twisted my friend at school said when she was five she saw a little & quot ; ghost & quot ; girl with a jump rope please give me a break people should have better things to do than sit their with a poopy diaper cause you are so scared and you are just sitting there in fear that a & quot ; ghost & quot ; will be in there	-1
You know why you ca n't get it on Kindle Fire ? It does n't have a camera , and all devices you can download on do . It utilizes the camera without you knowing , and it identifies the object and says the word . This explains why it needs so much information- it wires to the camera . I did n't realize this until I read you could n't get it on the fire and it uses a lot of info . If you do n't beleive me , you do n't , but an app ca n't utilize 1,000-5,000 dollar equipment .	-1
Boring did n't get it . Would not recommend it . Want money back . Not worth it not for me . Would not order again	-1
My friend and I were really scared until after five minutes , nothing . showed up . I recommend this app for little wimps . but this is a rip off . Well , it 's not really rip off when you can scare younger kids . It 's still stupid though . : (	-1
I have this application also on my ipad with the same settings and they do n't get anywhere near the same results.so far all I 've gotten are totally wrong words . like & quot ; sister & quot ; . I 've never had a sister .	-1
I thought , our at least hoped , this was some kind of game - there 's another ghost radar app that is actually fun and useful . This , unfortunately is a total waste of time .	-1
Do n't waste your money . I was hoping some how , some way this app would pick up on something . But everytime I moved my kindle a word would just so happen to pop up . It was fun the first day but now it just makes me mad when I turn it on .	-1
Maybe I just do n't know how to work it , but Ghost Radar Legacy does n't seem to be all that interesting .	-1
do n't spend your money on it its fake ti just says random words and the dot go away ! ? ! Not worth wasting money on it or gas prices ! do n't buy it . it dosent work . besides how would a Kindle or an aneroid phone detect ghosts ? ! ? THINK IT THOUGH ! ! ! do n't buy it ! ! ! ! -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- & gt ; : ~ (	-1
I ca n't believe a simple app in a device like a smartphone is capable of doing all that the app claims . Now that i 've 86ed it off my phone , how do I get it off my Amazon d/l queue ?	-1
This app can also be used as an Idiot Detector . If you download it . . . then you have been found : )	-1
as soon as I turned it on , I pointed it at my uncle Griswald and the words serial killer appeared on the screen . Right then and there I knew app was a fake . My uncle Grizzly is so mild mannered and would n't hurt a fly . I told him how it called him a serial killer and he just laughed and laughed ... and laughed..Then he said , be a good nephew and to put the duct tape , rope and hatchet in the trunk of his car because we are going for a little ride . OH BOY , I HOPE WE ARE GOING TO DAIRY QUEEN .	-1
what a waste . angry birds is more useful . $ .99 for this ? You got ta be kidding ! I think I 'll pass on this one ...	-1
This is a toy program not intended to find actual ghosts . I played with it for a bit then found it quite boring . I have uninstalled it but I might fiddle with it again in the future . I am using this on a Motorola Xoom tablet & it never crashed or caused any other problems .	-1
I love the idea of this app , however I ca n't stand the fact that this app takes over my wifi , locking it so NOTHING I owe is allowed to use my wifi network .	-1
At least they could have made the app somewhat entertaining . It spouted off a few meaningless words then stopped . What a waste !	-1
Just read the description.. & quot ; for entertainment purposes only & quot ; ..That 's all you need to know its fake & amp ; a sham . Buy this if you 're the type who 'd spend 2.99/mos . For Dionnes Psychic Network infomercials	-1
Like super lame . We played with it for about 5 minutes before we decided it was a waste of space on any device . Super glad we did not pay for it .	-1
Obliterated my battery . After 5 minutes in a quiet room at work 35 words were heard . I guess my office must be haunted .	-1
its stupid and pointless and ghost are n't even reel when you die you go to heaven or hell you cant go around the earth when your dead ! ! ! ! this is crape its totally stupid and its not real how would the developer get the app to sense all that stuff its crape lies ! ! ! I mean seriously if your stupid enough to beloved this *omg it works I saw a ghost* -_- really ? ! ... ... get a life spud pickles and make something worth our time ! ! ! God loves you : D	-1
what a waste of time . some woman 's voice randomly says words . do n't waste your time . App is junk . stupid . starts up and repeats dump words . it 's not interesting . it is bull oney .	-1
This app confused me and was not set up in a way I enjoyed . Feel similar ? Get period tracker lite .	-1
I was hoping this app was going to allow you to put in several dates , but it only allowed you to put in the date that you started . I was hoping to be able to put dates where cramping or spotting would occur , but that was not the case . This app is a standardized app for those who have the perfect cycle I guess .	-1
not a great game . really basic . will be playing along then it just stops and says you are at a new level . but not sure how you got there .	-1
I tried the app because my boys wanted it . They played it for about 20 minutes before getting tired of it . I played it for about 10 minutes and realized how little I was enjoying it .	-1
Some apps consider a Samsung Galaxy Tab to be a an Android phone and some do n't . This app does n't . I installed , tested a few functions then uninstalled it almost immediately .	-1
Bloomberg was one of the most-used apps on my iPhone so I was excited to see that it was available for Kindle Fire too . Alas , the font size is so small that it 's hard to read comfortably . So I rarely even use it . Looking for an alternative that works on all my devices .	-1
Bloomberg news app is n't Kindle Fire friendly . It works , but can use a serious update . The app itself is clunky and does n't take advantage of the larger screen than phones .	-1
This app appears like it is providing useful information , however does not provide actual live connection information . Try turning your router off , this app continues to give the connected info even varies a bit ti make you think its reading , reporting actual data .	-1
I have a kindle fire ( which u can check the wifi at the top by the settings tool bar ) . I wanted to see how it works so I downloaded it . But I tried to uninstall it but it wont work . Now it 's taking up app memory . ! ! !	-1
I was recently out of town and could only tap into Wi Fi one day out of five even though the hotel we were staying at had Wi Fi as well as aanother hotel and restaurant across the street .	-1
IT does n't do anything the wifi in my phone does n't already do . I do n't really see the point of the app .	-1
Never detects any wifi network although the device is connected . Must have never been tested on the Fire HD 8.9 . Useless . Uninstalled .	-1
Do n't like it . I deleted it . Didnt help me much and I am somewhat good at puzzles working off clues .	-1
I downloaded this for my Kindle Fire as the FAOTD - I tried playing , but could n't get it work - could n't find instructions for HOW to play other than a general description . I The graphics are very nice , but apparently the controls are not . Uninstalled after getting too frustrated with the game .	-1
In this game you need to direct different shades of colors to their correct place , which is not easy if you can not do it quick enough . If you can distinguish them then this game easy , but still not much fun .	-1
hard at first but got easier as I went it is decentI kinda like It but its just my kind of game	-1
Found the touch response a little buggy . Or , maybe my fingers just move too slow . Either way , I found the game more frustrating than fun .	-1
The game works fine . It 's simply boring . The gameplay is extremely slow and there is nothing to keep your interest . There are too many free apps that are so much more entertaining to bother wasting your time with this one . No one should pay for this .	-1
I do n't really see what is fun about this game . It is not complicated or anything , its just boring . Honestly do n't bother with this app , there are way better ones that are way more fun .	-1
The app ran fine on my EVO 3D . I just found it a little boring and not really my kind of game . You just guide colored balls to their destinations like it says in the description.Now that I have that out of the way . I hate Amazon Appstore . Amazon Appstore is dumb . I hope it gets abducted by aliens .	-1
It 's a game . There 's no excuse for games not having app 2 sd available . Games are not essential in any way to the performance of my phone . Therefore they can live on the sd card . Uninstalled .	-1
Seemed like a waste of space on my phone before I deleted it . Even for free , it is not worth the phone memory space .	-1
Kinda cool - but if you have seen it once that is enough - but not that exciting ... ... .rather a waste of space	-1
Got it when it was a free app of the day . I used it for about a week and then forgot about it . Have not used it since .	-1
An impulse download and a huge waste of time . It was difficult to use and I deleted is soon after .	-1
nice graphics..plays fast.. but you loose 95 % of the time . sometimes you have no possibility of winning as soon as the cards are dealt ... .not very much fun	-1
The description made this game sound very appealing , so kudos to the writers of the description . Unfortunately , the game is pretty dumb and does n't really hold interest . I kept thinking it would improve and get interesting , but it did n't . A very very young child MIGHT enjoy it . Otherwise ... .sorry ... not worth purchasing .	-1
Good download and install on my kindle fire . I played ? seven levels of the game and do not understand it . I do not know if I won or lost . I do not know what the objective of the game is . Uninstalled it .	-1
this app would be pretty cool , but it does n't work on my droidx . The app can never find a face no matter what I do .	-1
The app says processing and the proceeds to say that it failed . I tried several times to get it to work with no luck ! Needs better support !	-1
This app will not open on my samsung epic . I click the app and a black screen comes up ... and stays .	-1
This would be a cool app if i did n't get an unknown error every time I try to upload my own pictures . BOO ! Update this so I can have something new to waste my time with . : )	-1
Every time I tried this app , with either a new picture or one from my gallery , i either got an & quot ; Unknown Error & quot ; error ( which is the most useless error ever ) , or a & quot ; Face not found & quot ; error .	-1
This worked great when I first installed it back in Oct on atrix2 ... then it updated ... uninstalled ... reinstalled just the other day and nothing will load : ( (	-1
I had all 3 of my FB 's updating threw the app when I needed to add one more . It would not allow me to . So I removed one so I could add the other . No good . Removed.. Installed ... App only dose one accont now ... . Lame ! ! ! ! ! ! Sent msg to Seesmic and got no reply , so I am rating this app as a 0	-1
Seesmic was a great app . Was ! Now that Seesmic has advertising it crashes while trying to tweet messages . It forces you to shut it down and you lose the text you were typing . I can & quot ; t recommend this app until they fix this problem .	-1
I like Free Cell and I wanted to play this game . However , I found upon installing it that the cards are too small to see . I played the original version of this game on the original Kindle Fire and the cards were easier to read . Please revert the resolution back to the original format .	-1
you get what you pay for . just suck it up and buy a good version this one is very weak	-1
I liked the older version of this game ... it had a decent sized table . Now stacks are hard to read , there is not enough table space.My previous rating was 4 stars , but this update , while making it look more pretty ( and did help with functionality ) are ultimately ruined because the table size has shrunk .	-1
this app seems slow and clunky compared to spider solitaire . old technology perhaps ? I prefer to tap rather than drag . did n't care for the graphics . dated . has to be a thumbs down for me .	-1
Why would a paid app need to access phone serial , calls , state and numbers ? Oh yeah , greedy developers putting adware in a paid app that should contain none .	-1
For this today and keep getting message how program has stopped unexpectedly . You would think the featured game of the day would be a working one . Droid 2 .	-1
How do you play a game that offers no hints in how it works ? You do n't , you quit playing and no you wasted the money on a stupid game .	-1
I enjoyed the game while it lasted , but had completed the entire game in less than 2 hours . I was very disappointed to finish a game I 'd paid for so quickly .	-1
at first it was fun but then it got kind of boring . I did n't really like the game . it should be free ! : (	-1
tried rebooting my droid 2 and still would fc . too bad , these are great games to pass time with . glad it was a free app download and i did n't waste my money .	-1
I ca n't argue with anything that is free but I did not find the game to be any fun at all . I hope to see more fun free Apps and games from Amazon	-1
this app wont even show the first screen for me . it force close every time . I had to uninstall . I 'm running a samsung intercept running froyo 2.2	-1
Dell Streak7 -- force close immediately after launch . I tried turning the machine completely off , still wo n't work . I tried uninstall and re-install , still unexpected program stop.Uninstall permanently .	-1
force closes on Droid x at startup . just black screen and the app closes . shame too cause I really wanted to try this out . Stupid Amazon 25 word minimum .	-1
So short it was n't even worth the 49 & cent ; I paid for it . Wish I could get my $ $ $ back . You can play short games like this online for free .	-1
this game needs a help buttom , to at least help in the aero you are in on the game , i have gotten half way thru and for the life of me i can not get any far on the game ,	-1
This game sucks . It 's not worth the effort and time . It only takes you so far and you get mad and start pounding on your phone . A waste of my time..	-1
I 'm not even going to bother playing this . 15MB is too big to not be able to move it to my SD card . it just does n't make sense .	-1
I love Myst and was looking forward to playing this game . Unfortunately it kept force closing every time I ran it , I even uninstalled it and installed it again with the same results . Had plenty of free ram & amp ; internal memory.LG Optimus S Froyo 2.2.2 .	-1
Glad I got it free . It gives no instructions so you are left guessing the whole game on how to play or what to do next . Plus extremely short game from beginning to end .	-1
love the game style . it was a fun little thing , however the shortness and over simplicity of the puzzles made me feel like i played a demo . i am by no means downing the dev , in fact i wish to ask for more . you could even say i challenge the dev to make something bigger and more in depth . great concept , fun game , but pleeeeeeeeeeeease make a new better longer game .	-1
Fun game that worked once , then force close after force close after force close after force close . Did I mention it force closes ? Too bad really , uninstall . ( Samsung Vibrant )	-1
This app will not even launch on the motorola xoom . If it was n't free today , and I had paid for it I would be very irritated .	-1
the game is super fun and addictive . its way to short though . I finished it in an hour . I keep waiting on an update but it wont come .	-1
This game is a nice puzzle game but its over so quickly you 'll be left wondering if its a demo . That would n't be so bad if it were replayable but the puzzles Stat exactly the same so there is no replay value unless you have a short-term memory problem .	-1
I played this game in one hour ... ..this game stinks ! Do not waste your money ... .it 's not worth the 99 cents . It should be free and that 's pushing it '	-1
Forced close on LG Optimus . Uninstalling . Wish it would have worked though , it looks like a fun game . Will try again if bugs get fixed .	-1
Fun game so far . Have n't solved globe yet . Bug at the stairs that teleports you to the truck in the attic when you touch the key hole.Force closed when I put phone to sleep during gameplay . Tried to continue playing and that 's when it force closed.Samsung Fascinate 2.2 ( yay ! )	-1
if you are a fan of hidden objects or ihog games from bigfish or Oberon then you are used to the great graphics like the ones in this game . however , That 's where similarities end , game is short & amp ; frustrating . I completed almost all tasks but could n't change clock to 5:40 & amp ; therefore . could n't complete game . there are no hints or clues , if u are stuck google walk-thru for the game ( its all text whereas bigfishgames walkthrus have screen shots . ) & amp ; you 'll see where you are going wrong .	-1
Wo n't work on my device . Says it needs more mb but I just installed a 32g card . I would think there would be enough room for it to install .	-1
Let me start off with I only paid .99 cents for this app and it played very well on my kindle fire hd and that is why it got 2 stars . The game itself is very short which I would have been fine with for a dollar but add that to the fact that there was no hint button and no instructions to any of the games and the clues where very obscure and where not at all clear which puzzle they went to , and then the ending was just weird . Anyway I do n't recommend this game at all .	-1
Force closes everytime . Motorola Atrix . I will rerate once the game gets updated . And for the love of pete Amazon , update your apps more frequently and get rid of the 25 word minimum on these reviews .	-1
Ah well , the reviews said that this game is short . That is an understatement . I 've had sneezes take longer than this game . You find a few things , put them together and before your Kindle warms up you are done . No puzzles , no mini games , no story . VERY boring . Do n't waste your time or money . Take the 99 cents , put a penny with it and get a hamburger from MCd 's . At least you have something to show for your money .	-1
A fun little puzzle game , but the whole game takes just a couple of hours to complete . The low rating is because it is so short and because it 's no fun to go back and replay ( you already know all of the answers to the various puzzles/problems ) ,	-1
I.have read the reviews and agree with the graphics and the thought into what I did get/see/find . However , I do n't have a story line and can not seem to find anything more than what I quickly found . Not sure if something wrong with my download or if something has gone way over my head . I can not go further and I have done a lot of these games .	-1
Force closes before even an intro screen on my Motorola Atrix . Seems an update is required for multiple devices . Look for a fix before paying to download !	-1
I cant believe I paid money for this game . biggest waste of time ever . its like the writer got tired and just quit .	-1
When I got to play the game , it was fun , though entirely too short for a paid app . However , it force closes ALL THE TIME . If you 're going to make a paid app , be sure it works first , and make it long enough to be worth the money .	-1
This game was the worst game I have ever spent 99 cents on ..do n't waste one cent on buying this game ... consider yourself warned..the game makes no sense	-1
So I was pretty stoked about playing this game , since it 's genre is right up my alley . Unfortunately it keeps force closing on me , so I am unable to play it . Luckily I did n't pay for it , because that would have been a total waste of $ 0.99	-1
would not install to LG Ally 2.2.1. must be a great app but for now it isnt good enough for the low end androidswill update review later from the kindle fire	-1
I bought this to use with my pharmacy technician training for weight conversion . So to test it out , I entered 2.2 pounds ( generally accepted as 1 kilogram ) and the calculator came up with .998 kilograms . That makes this app of no use to me .	-1
This app came preloaded on the Kindle . I have never been able to get it to work ; it does n't load and will not even refresh .	-1
not enough players insufficent money to bluff as players fall out then heads up ok but not as only play available .	-1
It said I could get mp3 's of some music I had previously bought from Amazon , and it said it went to get them and downloaded them for me , and even showed me a list of artists that made sense as I had bought all those artists , but nothing was actually downloaded and my song list is empty . I 'll come back and try it again sometime maybe when it works properly .	-1
As Amazon Music with Prime Music has n't downloaded to my Kindle Fire and I ca n't figure out how to get it to download , ca n't say anything good about the service . I will happily revise this review once I experience it .	-1
I have been using this for the last couple months , it has been great until the update two days ago . I have a smart phone without a data plan , so I have music saved to the memory on my phone ; accessible when I am not in wifi range . It worked wonderfully as my & # 34 ; ipod & # 34 ; until Prime Music launched . My phone updated the app , and a massive amount of music was suddenly available for my listening pleasure . Great in concept ! But , the new version of the app has made playing songs from my device a miserable experience . Where it worked flawlessly a few days ago , it now takes MINUTES for a song to play . I give up on it working , put it back in my pocket , and a few minutes later hear the song take off . Skipping ahead ? Nope . Pausing ? Yeah , that works well still . Why does the new version affect songs that are stored to my device ? I do n't understand it .	-1
It *was* a great app with a great widget . Now , no more widget and constant ads for Prime . Very disappointing . Previous version would have been at least 4 stars , probably 5 .	-1
This used to be my main MP3 player on Android . It was never great , but it worked . Most recent updates have made it annoying to use as just a player . The initial screen is a selection screen to go to the store or player . You ca n't bypass this anymore . There are so many better players out there that this pushed it off my phone and tablet . Uninstalled .	-1
Music is very choppy and breaks up . Site is very confusing . Very nice for Amazon to give us this although . Thanks	-1
I have been waiting a month for amazon to troubleshoot why this APP wo n't function on my Samsung Galaxy S2 .	-1
Works on the Google Nexus 7-2 tablet , Not on the Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone . The functionality is straightforward and easy to use on the noted tablet . The app is totally messed up on the S3 phone . The only way to get music to play on the smartphone is in & # 34 ; airplane & # 34 ; mode . Otherwise the albums that were supposed to be downloaded did n't show up . On the phone , and trying to get to music via the cloud , Amazon blocks you from access to your music with a splash screen that holds you hostage from accessing music you 've already paid for unless you agree to try Amazon Prime for 30 days . Advice : Boycott until they stop that and fix the app .	-1
The latest version never gives me feedback of problem while signing in . But whenever I try to perform anything it ask me to sign in again . It is impossible to use it .	-1
Pure failure . It failed to run with a Force Close error the first launch and every time since . It says it 's up to date , so it musr be incompatible with the Samsung Galaxy S2 ... I would rate it a zero !	-1
The layout is not user-friendly if you are using this in any sort of a mobile/non-Kindle fashion.This is apparently designed for people sitting at home reading their Kindles.Fine , but I feel like I 've lost a useful app in the revision.In the previous app version : it was pretty simple to use while in car or exercising ( listening whilst in motion ) .You now have to stop , go to additional screens ( with small screens/touchpoints-even by mobile standards ! ) , & take extra steps to accomplish fairly easy functions ( get playlist on device , shuffle , repeat song , etc . ) .Unacceptable from both a safety ( car ) & /or usability standpoint ( exercise ) .When you buy an MP3 from Amazon while mobile ( eg : hear a song in a store that you like ) - it STILL loads it to the internal memory . ( ! ! ! ) My phone has 8GB- will spare you the math , but it 's an obvious flaw that has yet to be corrected.Apparently this app is designed for people who just sit and listen to music- perhaps people reading on their Kindles.Great if you 're sedentary - not so much so for other demographics.The default LG Music app is actually more user-friendly/easier to use under mobile conditions . ( This tells you how bad the Amazon Music with Prime Music app is ) .Just found out this morning that it deleted all playlists on my device with the upgrade.OH ... .SOoooo not happy about that.I thought they were on the SD card- my bad ; yeah , I ( now know that I ) should have backed them up.I spent a lot of time in hospital waiting rooms generating those playlists ( not at leisure at home at a PC where I could create , port , etc . ) .Am not happy about this.I see no reason to use my mobile bandwidth to listen to Amazon Prime . ( I do n't sit in coffee shops/school environs with free WiFi ) .When I 'm on a road trip- it 's my bandwidth that 's used if so.I have a huge SD card with tons of songs , and I do n't need to use bandwidth to listen.Prime Music offers me nothing in this situation.If I 'm at home , fine.But it simply does n't serve a new function for me- I have already Spotify / Pandora if I want ambient sound at home , with selections , playlists , etc . already set up.What do I gain here by using this app ? Whatever I do gain- it 's incremental/likely not worth the additional effort.Amazon 's late to the game on this.Will simply be buying less from Amazon Music because I wo n't be using their app ( wo n't be running across products to buy ) .	-1
There is nothing wrong with my account or one click settings but the buy button does n't work . : - ( needs work !	-1
LET ME DOWNLOAD IT ON MY KINDLE FIRE AND MAYBE I MIGHT GIVE IT AT LEAST A FEW MORE STARS ! ! Thanks .	-1
This MP3 player is useless on my Samsung Galaxy S3 Android 4.04 phone . The app will only use the phone 's internal memory to store all of its data . All the wasted megabytes for their album cover cache , and you can get about 15 or 20 albums at most on the phone ( depending on other apps you have ) before you will fill up an S3 . Streaming is fine , but that only works when you are on Wi-Fi unless you want to eat up your small ( these days ) monthly G4 LTE bandwidth cap . Which is fine if you only listen to your music occasionally , but not so cool if you are an every day audiophile like anyone who would bother to pay a monthly fee for Amazon 's MP3 cloud progam . So yeah , it 's useless . Deleted app , canceling cloud subscription , will just use a competitor cloud product and rip CD 's or whatever , if they ca n't make it convenient , then what good is it , really ?	-1
I did n't know I had a premium plan when I signed up for the service to begin with . Must have missed the memo . I do n't know how many people have only 250 songs . Thanks Applezon .	-1
I downloaded one album and it does n't work right . Constantly skipping and pausing and jumping around . Very annoying . I deleted it almost immediately from my kindle .	-1
I guess I did n't really get this app . I found it useless so I removed it . Not the best thing I ever purchased . Hope it works better for you . Lois A	-1
On DroidX running 2.2 , most of my music tracks dont player , the player just sits there thinking about playing the tracks ... FOREVER . this app needs to undergo some serious testing and improvement . Those are my thoughts .	-1
The app in its former life as the MP3 app was very good - at least 4 stars . The new version is only worth 1 star . What is most annoying is that whenever I startup the app it spams me with a full screen ad for Prime music with no obvious way to get to my music . I thought this trick was reserved for malware . I finally discovered that pushing the back & # 34 ; button & # 34 ; twice quickly on my device I could get to my music . This is not how an app which is supposed to stream music I pay for ( either by purchasing it or by subscribing to prime ) is supposed to behave . I really wish there was an alternative app .	-1
This program does n't work with Kindle Fire HD . I thought it would be a good app addition but , no luck .	-1
I have the Kindle HD Fire and this app does n't work ! I have the prime account and the prime music does n't download to my library . Wo n't be renewing my prime account !	-1
Web version works great , but I get a constant error when I try to access my music via my HTC Incredible . I 've tried all the tips and hints in the help forums , and still no solution works . Maddeningly frustrating .	-1
Purchased a couple of MP3 songs from Amazon and apparently they must be downloaded to the Cloud.I purchased the songs and feel that I should be able to put them anywhere I want . I have notfound how to move the files out of the cloud and put them on Windows Media Player or whatever.Do n't need some other file to cluter up my music .	-1
This is the worst TV guide i have ever seen . It does not work right for my area . I think all the show times are for the west coast living in the midwest i do not want to have figure out time difference just because it can not adjust to my currnet settings	-1
Just did not work for me ... and I uninstalled it after just a few minutes . Thank God it was free of charge . Good idea , but needs work .	-1
What junk ! I installed this and it 's sucks . I do not see the current temperature , it did n't update the latest scores even ONCE , and I ca n't find any documentation on how to send and receive text messages with this . Now I hate halloween . Thanks , devs .	-1
It 's a really cool wallpaper , only the problem is that is slowed my phone right down after a couple days of use . Too but RAM is required and it also uses a lot of the processor and kills the battery	-1
if you like smashing pumpkins and bats , or have small kids this will be ok. graphics are good and clear on 4.3 screen . compared to other halloween LWPs for the same price , this one is only worth the free ap of the day price . this dev . had some good things for BB , but has a way to go for android..	-1
It was a bit too cartoonish for my tastes , so I 'm glad I got it for free . It has some cute features but nothing worth 99 .	-1
I was trying to get the Zippo lighter app which is much nicer when I ended up with this one . I have since deleted it .	-1
Sorry Marc . I did not realize that this was more talking than actual music . Would have enjoyed it more without the dialog .	-1
. . . . . . . . to enjoy this app . Alas , I am not . He sounds very friendly and has a lot of fun with his songs , but most of them are not really Celtic , which is what I was looking for . Go for it Gunn fans !	-1
Tried this version and the one from Google Play . Neither work . I 'm using the original Kindle Fire rooted with Android 4.2	-1
I 'm sorry to IMDb for this review . Maybe it could be useful , if I cared about looking up movies/music/whatever this app does . But , this app was automatically installed on my phone ( Motorola DROID RAZR MAXX HD 4G Android Phone ( Verizon Wireless ) when it automatically updated to the Jelly Bean software version . I guess Amazon and Motorola and Google are all paying each other off - because now I am stuck with FIVE apps from them that I can not delete . Please let me delete this - I bought my phone for a lot of money , I should not have to have your junk on it .	-1
Somehow I have this app through both Google Play and the Amazon Appstore . The latter is a version behind Google and I ca n't remove it from my list of apps . Every time Amazon does an auto update I then have to go into Google Play and reupdate to the correct version . Sure wish Amazon would let us & quot ; forget & quot ; a downloaded app .	-1
Do n't play much games on my phone and this was a free app . I never installed it so ca n't stay if I would 've like it .	-1
The game is really lame ! It 's only a word unscramble game ! Do n't buy this game it 's a waste of time ! I only downloaded itbecause the cover looked cool . In the game you get attackedby skeletons and bats , so you have to unscramble words tosave your life .	-1
This was interesting for a little while , but eventually got boring and really was no challenge . I ended up deleting it from my list of apps . Since it was a FAOTD it was worth a shot , but I would n't pay for this . There are other word games out there that are much better .	-1
I think this would be great for a child or young teen learning to read or to get extra spelling in . Not so much for an adult	-1
I did have this app and have since deleted it AS MUCH AS I CAN.It seems it will not delete fully and I am . frankly , sick of trying all ways to GET RID OF IT ! I deleted from apps.I deleted from cloud.I deleted it from manage your kindle.I deleted it from the apps in my kindle fire hd 7 inch ( the settings sections ) and it still shows as taking up over 8 MB of my kindle space.I wish to remove it please.It seems then that this app is invasive in some way and my extra app uninstaller and my virus/malware protection devices do not help either.I really would like to award this no stars at all with all the trouble it has caused AND CONTINUES TO BE WITH ME despite my best efforts .	-1
Second time I 've tried Audible . Now that Amazon owns it , it 's worse than ever . You have to sign up for the subscription of $ 14.95/month that gives you one credit a month . A new John Grisham novel is listed at $ 35 ! ! ! How many credits does each book cost - varies . It 's very tailored to get you to also buy a Kindle.I also can not get my old title transferred to the & # 34 ; new & # 34 ; Audible . I keep entering my old log-in info , it will say it was accepted but then returns to log-in screen . Chat is not working to merge my accounts , so I have to call . The desktop program is like something from the early 90 's and I ca n't transfer books to my android phone . Spent hours trying to manually transfer the book - no go . Instructions are a mess , files are cryptic and you ca n't find anything and do n't know if the app downloaded the book or is streaming it . It is listed under both tabs , yet I ca n't listen to one of my books . I do n't know if the one I can listen to is being stream or is actually downloaded to my phone . Files are tied to your log-in , NO SHARING with someone else who had Audible ! I 've been around long enough to have lost songs I purchased when the & # 34 ; proprietary licensing & # 34 ; is no longer supported . Apparently this happened to the old Audible . AND you will NOT be able to listen to your books without the Audible software . So if you decide not to subscribe , you have to keep it loaded on your device to listen to that book you just spent a fortune on.CD 's are less expensive , easier to convert to MP3 , and then you can give it to as many friends as you 'd like , same with a paperback book . Better yet , start uploading them to Pirate Bay - I now see why they exist when companies pull this cr*p. It would be one thing if digital media was less expensive , but it 's more expensive ! One book or audio CD can be passed around and resold and there 's no risk of it becoming unusable because of a format change.Stick with your library or go buy something you can actually keep and share . CD 's are n't dead as far as audiobooks go .	-1
The prices are way too high for the audible books , I 'm not willing to buy them and have deleted this from my tablet	-1
crashes on my Kindle Fire ( does n't Amazon own Audible ? ) .. All I wanted to do was buy a couple audio books for a road trip ... evidently not so easy ... . the service sucks , the app sucks ... therefor 1star ...	-1
Only the app itself is free but there are no free books , this would be fine if it stated this up front , do n't like the deception !	-1
ordered this item by mistake I do n't have an adroid have iphone and it did n't work with iphone so mistakenly ordered	-1
I like the web versions of the store and of webpages not the app version of this . Maybe I am cut from a different cloth , but that is just what one brother likes . Nothing bad about the the app per se , I just do not enjoy the experience it provides .	-1
This app works well on the Kindle but on the Android I can not find books to download . No matter what I try the books ( one in particular ) that I can find on my Kindle do not appear on the Android . This is very discouraging . The only plus is I can download almost any game that I do n't want or need . Please correct this matter or let me know what I am doing wrong .	-1
I have to use this program for my cheap polaroid tablet that i got at biglots and I love my tablet it does it all , but the amazon marketplace is junk . U use it once and it works , then it just doesnt launch . You have to delete it and reload it everytime . Its just stupid . I wouldnt recommend it ... . its awful !	-1
I updated and now I ca n't use the scanner ... uninstalled . It was fine before .. : ( Developers if you can read this ... please fix it !	-1
I moved to a more rural area and my scanner just does n't pick up much here . I was hoping this would help fill the void . I was wrong . It 's only good if you are in a large metropolitan area and then a regular scanner is much better .	-1
when i opened the app it looked fine till the peices were miplaced all over the place n all that stuff it may be my tablet cause it worx on my lil sis kindle fire try it its a good app n game just not working with me	-1
Just plain wo n't work ! ! ! I just do n't know what to do with this app , except to take it off the Kindle .	-1
If I have to stop and start over because it freezes up this game does n't work for me . I like to keep going and this app needs some updates or alterations to make it a smooth game to play .	-1
one word for ya ... it stinks well two words . ii I 'm someone and id like to say have u been entered in a dumb game.like this well.me stupid game lied . jk	-1
it is just not as fun as knocking the board if you win or lose the game and jumping and kinging is just not as fun with the cyber version .	-1
I ca n't out play the computer so I deleted it and I will not re-down load it again . Not for me .	-1
Its just one of those games that you play for one day then get bord of it . It would be more interesting if u could play against real people . The freaking computer always wins ! / :	-1
I would not recommend this product to any one it was the worst app I have ever tried to use . It would freeze , or stop and e few minutes later would work on and off ... Thank you George ;	-1
the game fails to recognize when you have won do you have to end the game as a loss . the game freezes and will not let you select a piece to move on your turn resulting in another forfeit .	-1
its mega wack . why is there an undo button . u mind as well restart the whole even though its not there . I did n't even Finnish my game and it does n't save . I dnt understand how y'all could write good things about this . the computer is easy . no competition . dnt get it	-1
Downloaded and installed and nothing worked . I deleted it from my Kindle . Consider this the additional 8 words I need to type to answer .	-1
It was a free game , the premise and graphics looked cool , but it ended up being nothing special . I deleted it in less than an hour because it was really that not special . From what I can remember , it 's in the same vein as pac-man , and I 'd rather just get pac-man than this .	-1
After installing and playing Evac HD my Apex Launcher Pro does not work . I uninstalled Evac HD and Apex still does not work .	-1
I do n't even care to download this game , because we have determined that it does n't work properly on the Kindle Fire ( which has n't stopped Amazon from selling it at a 30 % windfall ) . But I do want to post a proper 1-star review to make up for the obvious developer reviews , which all have the same wording and a similarly poor grasp on spelling and grammar . And of course , we 'll need to make up for the Brit who called everyone a & quot ; twit. & quot ; Is n't Hexage a British company ? Hmm ... Now , off to review their other app , which one of the shill reviews has graciously tipped us of too .	-1
I admit I have n't tried this game ... and wo n't . To many invasive permissions for my liking . There is no need to have any info about my networks . Try again on your next app and you will get the same response .	-1
I rarely review apps , but had to on this . I get a little tired of everyone complaining about permissions all the time . If you want games on your phone , that 's the name of the game . Some of the most fun games I have , are loaded with invasive permissions . I am not doing this to balance dev reviews , although I believe that is a shady practice by devs . This is an honest review . This game blows . Not even hd graphics like it suggests . Pac man is 2.99 , go with that . I installed to see for myself , often reviews are inaccurate . I played the first level , and uninstalled before I got the email from amazon . Not worth the space it takes up .	-1
ASUS TF300T JELLY BEANThis game is made well enough . It 's just boring . I tried for two weeks to get into it and just could n't .	-1
The controls are nit sensitive enough for touch play . Graphics are circa 1970 , with little more then a butchered Pac-man theme . Make something original for once .	-1
Pros:1 ) Is fairly feature-rich2 ) Has an associated thesaurus2 ) Not much elseCons:1 ) Larger than advertised - installs at 6.18MB , NOT 3.12.2 ) Requires an internet connection ( to support the ad bars along the bottom - why else not have the word list and definitions on the device instead on lookup ) .3 ) Fairly large memory footprint . Not a problem for more modern devices or those with memory to spare but smaller or slower units will suffer.Overall , not that terrible if you do n't mind the ads and the forced internet connection ( both of which I despise ) , but might require that you watch the memory usage .	-1
This app was n't at all what I thought it was . I could n't use it quickly or easily so I swapped it for a more user friendly dictionary .	-1
What I expected was a very useable app . This is n't it , unfortunately - BUT I 'm not a smart phone user and not familiar with apps . This one might be good for those who use apps often .	-1
I chose this rating because I received an email from Amazon begging me to rate the app in the inbox of my email . Anytime someone had to ask for a compliment I rate em pretty low . With Wikipedia all over the net why waste space on your device with this app ? Huh ? Answer me punk , huh ?	-1
Thought this would be cool for my 18mo . Unfortunatly it crashes within a minute on my samsung galaxy note tablet	-1
THIS APP HAS UNKNOWN PROBLEMS . IT CAUSED MY KINDLE TO STOP OPENING UP MY DOWNLOADED APPS . I HAD TO CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE AND GET MY KINDLE REREGISTERED AND GO BACK TO THE FACTORY SETTINGS BEFORE I COULD GET MY KINDLE TO GET BACK TO WORKING . I FEEL THAT DOWNLOADING THIS APP CAUSED ALL THE PROBLEMS AND I HAD TO COMPLETELY DELETE IT BEFORE THINGS WENT BACK TO NORMAL	-1
I 've played much better solitaire games with better options than this one . It will do just fine but I did delete it and search for a different one . It just had no pizazz and is a routine solitaire game that you rarely win . If you do win , the ending is much more dramatic in other versions .	-1
Come on , really ? Do you think the average Amazon reviewer would type like that ? Other than the fact that it 's obviously derivative , the difference that makes this game worse than it should is that it keeps track of how many moves you make and judges you for them . That adds unnecessary pressure that a certain unamed game on the iPhone market ( that will remain unnamed ) does not have , and is a better game for it .	-1
Not at all what I wanted glad it was free . Would have been very upset if I had to pay for it . Not good at all .	-1
Its alright but i would suggest that they add something different to it because its kind of boring . Its fun	-1
I downloaded it but I do n't really like it . I assumed that it would be more like some other puzzle games that I downloaded but it really was n't . I got bored with it after only a couple of screens .	-1

He did not like the game so he deleted . he said it was no fun it you have to keep buying things with real money .	-1
Downloaded with no problem to my kindle fire . Did not use the app as after thinking about it I did not feel comfortable placing all my passwords and info in one app . Also instructions were not easily understood . I removed the app several days ago .	-1
I download this to my kindle fire hoping to have one place to store/lookup my usernames and passwords . But there is no instructions or a write-up on how to use this app ? ? Maybe for techies this is n't a problem but for most people some intial setup help would be appreciated . I got what i paid for !	-1
I agree the game needs hints , or at least a hint option ! There are far too many words in the English language to leave it up to random chance . Besides , I do n't think I 've ever played hangman without a hint before !	-1
I really want to try this app but I do n't have the chance . Every time I try to open the app , it force closes . I 'm on 4.0 ( ICS ) and maybe there is n't support for it yet ?	-1
it is ok but it is a little fun so that is why I rated it as 2 stars I love the game but not that fun	-1
its fun but they need more tries I never win ! ! its cool that u can choose the topic . but its preaty fun but not so addictive !	-1
This is a review from my 8yo girl : I downloaded this app , but I figured out the words are too hard or is n't in a catigory . Then I tried to remove it from the kindle , but it stayed on my device . So here 's a little tip , DO N'T DOWNLOAD THIS APP !	-1
I 'm not saying that hangman is suppose to be easy but some of the words are very difficult to guess .	-1
So stupid ! Total waste of time just dumb and foolish app not worth the time and effort I used to download it .	-1

The categories are very wide and there are no clues to help you to solve the words . Very frustrating and no fun at all	-1
This game is hard.And its always acting up.If y'all like like this y'all crazy ! Like this one time I put in the right answer and it put in a really bad word so I called the people that owened the game and they said they ment to do that so I said this is a bad game they said do n't talk to me like that they said a cusing . word thetheman said I know where you live I said I 'm going to call the police ok he said . a bad word THAT 'S .

Would Not Work on Sylvania SYTAB10ST - Cycles Back to Options Screen After First Letter for Word is Selected Whether One or Two Player Mode . Demo on PC Looked Like Fun Game - Too Bad !	-1
never . ever . I mean never , waste your free time purchasing this app . it did n't even take me one minuet to figure out that this is a really bad app so do n't purchase this app .	-1
Do n't waste your time . The app never makes it past the second screen . Then it hangs and closes . The only thing it will let you do is buy more games !	-1
This game is fun since its hangman and its free , but it is hard at times because it gives you no idea whether it is a person , place , or thing so it could be dog , fog , or log and you lose 5 out of 10 times .	-1
There was no clue as to what category the word was about . I just got a screen with a number of blanks and of course the hangman . It 's no fun having to guess a random word just by the number of characters it has .	-1
I own a Kindle Fire . It stated in the description that it would work on a Kindle Fire . No ... .it does not work on a Kindle Fire . Perhaps the company needs to correct or revise their description .	-1
this was hard but fun for a while then on my kindle fire then it asked me to rate I said no and now it wont let me play the free game I have to buy it with real money	-1
Ok . It quite to play with my grandson but not something I would recommend for anyone over the age of 8 . Need more	-1
I have a Hangman app on my iPad that I love , and thought I 'd get one on my Kindle Fire as well . This particular one was a great disappointment , especially compared to the one on the iPad . The graphics are crude and it is just not a pleasure to use . Deleted it after just a few games .	-1
if u pick a category and play it has nothing to do with the subject and if u play to player player one atomaticly wins	-1
I hate it . No directions , not very user friendly . on my Kindle I can not center in on the neighborhood I want to . no school listings that I have found . Not as good as the computer ap	-1
Barely works on my Panasonic tablet . It goes completely slow and the filter does n't update very well . it says something about the website not being available . Zillow.com works fine on the browser .	-1
Sometimes I think Amazon is really , truly insane . I had the Trulia app installed on my 7042 and it ran PERFECT , no problems at all . Amazon uninstalled it from my tablet , please do n't bother asking me ! ! Just let yourself snoop around on my tablet and remove whatever tickles your fancy.Meanwhile , I install this Zillow garbage on my 7042 and of course , it does NOT work . Please Amazon , the Trulia app WORKS so let me have it back ! !	-1
Really good app for a tablet - the ability to pan and scroll on a touch screen makes this much better than on desktop/mobile . Every house hunter/realator should have this app .	-1
This app did nothing for me . I wish I could give it zero stars . Did not even show anything near me that was for sale/rent .	-1
Deleting app . All I could see was maps and aerial views , no actual homes . Very few directions as to how to view a house with photos . Will be switching to another real estate app to find a home for retirement .	-1
waste of time and space for my Kindle Fire . kept freezing up and never could get it to work , so I uninstalled it the same day	-1
I have used Zillow on my computer so thought I would download it on my Kindle Fire too . Do n't know what the problem is but I ca n't get it to do what I can do on the computer . It wo n't go to the area/neighborhood I want to look at . I will say maybe it is me , but I do n't think it is user-friendly .	-1
Tried to search for 5 acre parcels and could only find houses . I can use other real estate search programs and get better more detailed information .	-1
This site is great but the listings are outdated . I get excited about a house and find out is under contract or sold and off the market for a while .	-1
I can not figure this app out at all ! ! ! Not what I had expected and will not find this very useful . Sorry , but no thanks !	-1
I used it for five minutes , and quickly realized it was not helpful at all . Not enough detail , and hard to find what your looking for . We need a real real estate app .	-1
This app is not formatted correctly for the kindle fire screen . The list covers over half the screen and can not be moved . Its too bad because on other devices this is a great app .	-1
After entering my FL Zip Code , the data that appeared is in Hamilton , IN . And , there seems to be no way/nobody to contact at Zillow when you see a & # 34 ; problem & # 34 ; . Other issues include incorrect values of properties and listing of sale of my residence since I have been living here ? ? ? No way was my property sold to anyone but me ! Also , recent sale $ of property in my neighborhood is incorrect ! ? Ca n't use this app since it 's not reliable .	-1
I was won over by the good reviews so I thought this would be the app for me . But all I can see is an error message . If you want a real estate app try Hotpads although that app would be better if it showed more detail such as how much lan the house is on . I have a Zeki ice cream sandwich .	-1
they should make just a date calculator ... and make it way easier to understand ... I mean ... I 'm pretty darn good at technology ... but this is way over my head !	-1
the events are not cached so it always refreshes that- which is annoying . and what is so special about Friday the 13th ?	-1
YOU HAVE TO PUT IN HOLIDAYS FOR IT TO WORK ! DO NOT GET IT WASTE OF YOUR MONEY ! REALLY IT IS ! STUPID APP !	-1
Theres not even a widget ? Days left widget is free , does all the same stuff . Another crappy app that I 'm skipping .	-1
well other than not being able to download the file ... . I give it zero stars . Said that the file as corrupted and could not be download , someone please check it out .	-1
Why ruin a perfectly good app idea with mysticism ? There 's no power in a number or day of the week or combination , much less put a satanic looking skull on the 13th page , I do n't want that cr # p on my phone . What a waste for a potentially good app .	-1
This app has pop up ads for & quot ; Romantic Ringtones & quot ; that actually link to a porn website . Very shocked and disturbed . Not appropriate for children and had to uninstall : (	-1
The Amazon version is several revisions behind the one in the Android Market . Did the developer abandon Amazon because it was offered free ? and you ca n't upgrade using the Android Market version .	-1
When a problem happens ( and always does ) all you need to do is get yourself a new life ... I personally know people who had problems with this app ... stay away	-1
I 'll start by saying this seems to be the best password keeper I 've found . The interface is relatively clean , and it 's very configurable - it does n't lock you into some developer 's idea of which and how many fields each entry should have . It uses higher-level encryption than any other program I 've looked at , and it syncs with your desktop - something only one or two other apps do . It 's also relatively inexpensive with a one-time purchase fee instead of an annual subscription.That would all be great if it were n't for some pretty inexcusable drawbacks . First , you can export your password list in order to move it to another device , but inexplicably the program exports to a completely unprotected .csv file ! It 's not even an option , there 's just no way to encrypt the exported file . How you can develop a program that is designed to encrypt and protect data , then force users to export that data into a clear-text file is just beyond me . Even worse is the fact that you can only connect to and sync data between your phone and computer if you install Apple 's Bonjour service . Are you kidding me ? This is what makes the app nothing but a bad iPhone port . Hey guys - I bought an Android phone for a reason ! If I wanted to have to install Apple software on my computer I would have bought an iPhone ! Bottom line is , no thanks . Do n't force me to expose my password data if I need to export it , and do n't force me to install Apple software to connect to an Android phone . What a shame .	-1
once you buy the App . you have to buy the desktop sync software separately . deceptive ! I wish they had included both for one low price .	-1
apps should at least LOOK like someone put some time and effort into creating them.This one looks like a s school homework project.Every thing is so basic , underdesigned , ugly.I got it for free . The idea that they charge $ 5 for this big nothing is outrageous.Apple would have never allowed such app in their store . Maybe android should learn some quality control from them .	-1
the tilt controls do n't work very well . Tilt controls are something that few games work well with and this is not one of the games that they work for .	-1
I snapped this up for the FAOTD , hoping to finally get a grip on my budget.But if you get bi-weekly payments , you are SOL . There is n't an option for bi-weekly pay . Which is quite a glaring omission . Just doubling up does n't work , since with bi-week you can get more than two payments every so often.Please fix ! I do n't mind this since I got this for free , but if I had paid almost ten bucks for a budget app that does n't contain one of the most common types of pay periods ? I 'd be ticked .	-1
another app that ca n't be turned off ! unistalling because it 's constantly running in the background even after force closing despite seemingly harmless permission settings	-1
for all of you gamers out there looking for a fun app of the day keep looking ... THIS IS NOT A GAME ... it is a boring app for adultsthat have money	-1
Now that I 'm officially retired , I need to get serious about budgeting . This is billed as 'easy ' , but there are no instructions and I 'm a babe in the woods with this stuff . I never could put a budget together - only create categories but found no way to put a $ figure in . Where I accidently did ( how ? ? ) I could not put in cents.Now I have to figure out a way to return it and get my $ 10 back.Not easy at all . Needs a help or how-to option .	-1
App made no sense . Everything is too complicated . I got it for free , and saved 10 bucks . That is more then this app will ever tell me !	-1
Great app on my iPod Touch . Not so great on Kindle Fire because there is no way to adjust volume .	-1
This app does not do a stream at all . I want this app to stream the radio station in a local area . And the tablet is a Trio Stealth Lite .	-1
The app functions nicely but they lacked several of my favorite stations in my hometown I wanted to listen to . Go with iheartradio to get a more complete list .	-1
everytime I wan na play music while I read on my kindle fire it plays the channel for two seconds and goes back to buffering over and over again annoying but like that I has lots of options though	-1
I did n't really care for this app on my phone . While it found some radio stations near my home , it failed to recognize my favorite stations . Then when I did try to stream live from the stations it did list , the connection continually paused and eventually forced stopped a couple of times . This app was just not good for me ... hopefully others have an easier time with it .	-1
I could not seem to get the same station twice in a row with this app but I have to admit that it offered a lot of genres to choose from .	-1
It wo n't let u long in and will not load current radio shows . I am very dissatisfied w/ the FREE app . : (	-1
Unusable on 1st gen Kindle Fire after December update . Will only force close now . App used to be great . Unfortunate .	-1
I liked how this app worked ( Mostly . The tendency to replay a loop of the past few seconds while buffering , not so much ) , but when they started playing highly targeted ads that could only have been selected for me by accessing my email content , I dropped them like a hot coal . Sometimes extensive permissions really are necessary for reasons that are n't immediately obvious , so I gave them the benefit of a doubt when I first downloaded the app , but in this case , your suspicions are warranted .	-1
I could n't find reception and the songs were not good ! Definitely love Pandora a lot more ! It was quickly deleted .	-1
i hate it it has like no radio stations that i want and most of them are local . so they need to have these stations avalible or dont put them on and dont send me to a simular station	-1
I downloaded this app on my Velocity Cruz tablet , and it did n't work . If your tablet is incompatible with certain apps ( angry birds , netflix , etc . ) , do n't bother .	-1
I obtained this app to be able to listen to music while in Hawaii ( limited radio stations ) The app did not function correctly in my new ipad ( newest model withe the latest version of IOS ) . You could not close the app or stop the stream . The app caused my IPad to lock up . I had to force a restart of my IPad together it to stop and to remove the app.I would not recommend it .	-1
Wanted a free music app and this is not it . You need to have an account to access the music .	-1
I did not find this app to be very good . It list all the radio station from all over the country but what you need to know is that they are not all able to play on this app . I was trying to listen to my local country stations in Colorado and it always went to a radio station in Alaska . I also checked my favorite country stations in Alabama and it always went to the same station in Alaska .	-1
The stations are pre listed so you really ca n't tune in to what you want to hear on the free version , not sure about the paid version cause if the free one do n't live up to anything , I do n't think it would be worth the purchase .	-1
None of the stations load properly . They 're either 'idle ' or play for two seconds and load for fifteen in between every two- second play . What a waste ! Maybe it 's my phone , but i doubt it . I have an LG Optimus ; if you have one too i suggest you NOT waste your time on this app . I really think that this app is nothing more then a cross country radio station index . Most of the stations do n't even load .	-1
As other reviewers noted there are sneaky signup things when you start the game . Three in a row when I started it . Bad app.In addition to that , as if it were n't enough , gameplay is bakwards ! If I tilt up the ball goes down , left it goes right . Totally counterintuitve.The game itself looks decent . But not great . Take a pass on this one .	-1
Not compatible with Android Cruz T301 as stated : ( . I have the biggest SD card you can use with it , and it still wo n't install . ? I just wish it would n't state it 's compatible if it is n't .	-1
works bad with kindle fire . always asking for your name zip code and more ... do n't get it unless you want to give your info away	-1
I know I must not complain because it is a free app . But if the developer takes feedback with a positive attitude then please read:1 . The menu needs to be revamped with better style as there is too many things to press before one can start playing the game and is annoying.2 . Most of the time the app does not seem to register taps on the menus ( Tested on Kindle Fire ) The game gets very challenging with lots of holes where the balls slides thru ' Please make provisions for the ball to re-emerge somewhere else rather than starting from scratch it will make this app even more engaging and challenging.Please make some boards with different background colors as it might get more interesting to play rather than seeing the same color board every-time.Thanks for reading my comments .	-1
its an ok game to play . the difficolts are all messed up . at one moment you could be on the medium level in the end of the level and you would get an very easy level . i have never listend to the music because i listen to pandors too much . i like the 3-d effect i gives off though .	-1
Was not what the description said . I wasted money on it . I would not recommend it all . I was very disappointed .	-1
When I downloaded it , I was thinking of my 94 year old mother . However , it soon became apparent that whomever goes first has the best chance to win . It just was n't what I was looking for .	-1
this game is to easy to play i fall to sleep every time i play it . wish it was a little harder .	-1
My grandson and I played this in the car while we were waiting for a prescription one day ! It was fun to use for that but let 's face it , this is not as fast paced as all the games that are out there .	-1
The game loaded , but could not get it to play on my device . The graphics were not that great either .	-1
This is such a bad app . We can not get it to work . And there was no place I could locate for app support .	-1
It kept freezing up all the time and would n't work right , so I finally got mad and I uninstalled it . It was fine when it worked ! !	-1
This game makes itself win my opinion DO N'T JUST DO N'T GET IT this is such a rip off do n't get it	-1
Tic Tac Toe , Three in a Row . Dumb . Plain Dumb . Why Get This App . Really . Why ? Ugh . Stupid App . Hi .	-1
It does not work . It failed to download twice no more to say except it does not work . again no .	-1
- The game is pretty repitious . It would probably be great for little ones who are learning how to play .	-1
it was way to easy to play , maybe when my grandbaby get order , i would get it again	-1
we tried playing this game read the instructions and had others try it no one could figure it out gave up and got rid of it so it did not waste memory	-1
The game we all played as kids I always start in the center block and rarely ever lose it passes time but if you bore easy you may not like this game	-1
uninstalled because of too many permissions and it is always running in the back ground . rather not use it . please change .	-1
this application does not work on the motorola xoom it is also a demo app and some features are locked in this free version . ca n't comment on phone function as I did n't care to try it on my evo..	-1
I ca n't get the game to start . I have to tap nowhere near the button to get it to activate and I 'd have to press off the screen to get the start button to work .	-1
This version is completely non-functional . It 's old , and from before Twidroyd had their API key suspended from the market . It was out of date even on Amazon 's launch day . If you want to use this app , go to the market . Hopefully they 'll update this here and this review wo n't apply , but right now it 's an old out of date app that does n't work . Honestly , this concerns me about the whole Amazon market concept . If a developer is n't going to update apps here , and if it were a paid app , you 'd be out of luck .	-1
Pretty simple , the app does not install , period . Do not get it , even if it is `` free '' you can ; t get rid of apps and it 'll just sit there in your cloud making you regret tapping the button to grab it .	-1
This app loads , and will PLAY , but it takes a minute ( literally , ) to aim , and another minute for the ball to roll to the other balls , and for them to roll ... . : ( It 's like a slow motion thing that wo n't speed up . : (	-1
I love shooting pool , and thought this app would be an awesome past-time . The controls are hard , and complex . Over all , not impressed .	-1
I appreciate the ability to track fitness and eating but am frustrated at how slow and tedious it is to enter in a recipe for analysis . I have stopped using this site simply because it 's too much work .	-1
my daughter told me about this and I bought it , but I don ; t know what to do with it..sorry I couldnt be more help	-1
Not a great site.. no resp . area to get answers ... maybe works for SOME But I want I wanted calories w/food ... not have to but in .	-1
You have to input the foods and calories and you work outs to . Plus i found another what that its a little easy to used .	-1
Entering the food is difficult as it requires a lot of searching to finally find the food that matches what one has eaten - or is about to eat . Also , the Tracker does not allow me to enter my weight lifting results . It has the exercises , including the reps , amount of weight , number of sets , but after the form gets filled out it lists each exercise but the calories are not counted . It is just an entry without a result . Oddly , it does list and count the results of carido exercises . Frustrating.So I stopped using it.AD2	-1
Could never get past the license agreement . The app keeps flashing the license agreement no matter if you agree or not . Uninstalled , reinstalled , then uninstalled permanently for same reason . hope you have better luck thn I did .	-1
I looked it over after downloading it and decided that it was n't what I wanted or needed . So deleted it .	-1
this app stinks i hate u cant do it with out a account i hate this app this app is stupid ! ! ! ! ! ! app	-1
Opened it and selected to create a new account . All fine until birth date . Oldest year allowed is 1970 . Really ? App is only for those born on or after 1970 ? Basic flaw makes me wonder about the rest of the app , so think I 'll just uninstall ... .	-1
It would have been nice to know that it REQUIRES you to create an account in order for it to function . On top of that they want way too many permissions . Not worth it at all .	-1
I did not like this app but did find a better one called & # 34 ; Lose It. & # 34 ; I would suggest that one over this and all others .	-1
can not get it to work correctly	-1
After downloading it , tried to input foods and discovered that I had to input every food in the program . Apparently , it does n't have a library of grocery and restaurant foods that I can choose from .	-1
I tried to register to use this app and it said that my email was already registered . Well , since I am the only one with my email and I have never registered to use this Calorie Counter before I do n't know how that could be . I sent them an email and told them of the situation and they have NEVER responded .	-1
I 'm sorry , but this app just would n't work for me . I could n't get it to work ... it 's as easy as that . Sorry ! ! !	-1
This app is a complete disappointment . I was expecting something to look up caloric details for all types of foods . This program did not allow that at all .	-1
it keeps saying I need to upgrade it , but there is no upgrade button . so the note will continue to come up . its really annoying .	-1
Much better on pc . You ca n't save pictures to your phone . Not happy about that . Needs to be fixed soon	-1
This ap loads at startup and runs in the background all the time . It is a comparatively large ap ( one of the biggest of the 50 odd aps I have on my tablet ) and could cause problems for people with low ram or a slow processor . If you use it all the time , if it is one of the primary uses of your device then maybe that 's OK ( i.e . it is n't taking resources from something else ) .Even so , it is something to be aware of . I stripped it off my tablet after 2 days because I grew tired of having to shut it down whenever I turned on my device ... and wanted to use it for something else ( and I have about the fastest processor available now on mobile devices ) , and a lot of ram . It is not a problem unless I am running another program which needs a lot of memory , but why have a memory hog running in the background ? This service is not that much more convenient then others , not enough to where I think it is worth the amount of ( disk ) space it demands , or the memory load . Add to that what is effectively spyware ( why would it be running in the background if it is not monitoring & reporting as you agreed to allow when you installed it ) . Personally I do not think the package is worth what it costs in terms of system lag ... but that is a personal thing . If you do a lot of uploading and this service is your primary means of sharing pictures then it could be worth it to you . If your system is suddenly laggy , use something like taskill to turn it off .	-1
Photobucket used to be a useful place to store photos and from which to post photos to the forum I frequent . Now all Photobucket images posted by dozens of the members of our forum are no longer visible to any of us viewing from first-generation Kindle Fires . I have read that those on other Android devices are having the same problem in addition to other trouble . Search & quot ; Photobucket problem Android & quot ; to verify what I 'm relating .	-1
I can not edit photos with this app . Its really useless if the purpose does not apply ! I have to main page to edit .	-1
I guess since I did not buy more chips , the game blackouted ( the screen is all black and can not do anything with the game , so a complete bust	-1
Just an ad for you to buy more stuff behind the curtain . You would think reputable companies would stop doing this kind of stuff . If you own a device like this one I am typing on , you are n't stupid .	-1
Would give zero stars if that were possible . On my Kindle Fire the play screen is only 2x2 and no apparent way to increase the size . Settings only allow for turning sound on/off and purchasing expensive points ... ... deleting this piece of crap immediately .	-1
Extra charges will be placed on your order every time you collect & # 34 ; bonus chips & # 34 ; . I contacted Amazon , and did n't get any resolution .	-1
Have to rate game in order to get chips to even play game ... not good . It would be rather difficult to rate an inflated game , would n't you think ?	-1
I WANT TO REMOVE THIS FROM MY TABLET . DO NOT LIKE IT - AFTER YOU PLAY TO A CERTAIN LEVEL IT WANTS YOU TO & # 34 ; BUY & # 34 ; MORE CHIPS . THE GAME JUST IS N'T WHAT I EXPECTED IT TO BE AND REALLY WANT TO GET RID OF IT .	-1
I like Black Jack , but if I use all of my coins , you keep asking me to PURCHASE more coins and watch some sort of video ads . I will not purchase coins and as sitting for the length of time that the video run I am not happy about and so that means that I will not be playing the black jack game	-1
Do not know who placed this on my Kendlal or anything about this transaction.. I will remove it from our macnine	-1
There should be a warning at the beginning of the game that when you run out of credits , you have to buy any additional credits that you may want . I was getting bored and hit & # 34 ; all in & # 34 ; and lost . I would n't have done that if I knew it would finish the free game .	-1
The sales prompts that kept coming up were rather annoying . Yes , I was aware that they would come up once in a while , but it was getting to be too much .	-1
I have used it to test different Strategies . I thought it would be a completely random process for the program to generate cards , but I was wrong . At low wager level ( say less than $ 10 ) , it is close to random with the house having slightly higher winning percentage . As soon as you go up the amount of bet above $ 10 , you will see that you are always at a huge disadvantage ! The intent is very obvious : to bankrupt you quickly so you may buy chips from them . Instead of playing blackjack , you are blackmailed ! Screw it , I will never spend a penny on this wicked program.The only good thing is to train you the basic strategy with the smallest bet , but for that purpose , there are plenty of good apps doing much better training job.The U I is good .	-1
not what I wanted	-1
Nice while waiting	-1
when I got on it I played once and lost but then it would n't let me start a new game . complete waste of time . D ;	-1
I played is game an liked it . But the next day must of my chip were gone would not get this game . It sucks ... ...	-1
I blew all my ( free ) money the first few minutes and every time I tried to add more it wanted to charge me . I 'm not in this to play for money , I just want to have fun . I deleted the app .	-1
The game is good ; however , when you need chips they eventually give you one option and it cost money to continue .	-1
You only get free play for a short time then it starts prompting ( and interrupting you ) for additional products . It seems pretty geared to rushing the losses so you will have to purchase something to get more fake coins to continue to play . Uses up a huge amount of data time .	-1
I was expecting a nice clean basic game of blackjack not an advertisement for online & # 34 ; real & # 34 ; casino gambling . Guess I should have read the fine print .	-1
How do I get rid of this app and others that I do n't care for ? I have no more comments on this app	-1
I did n't like it at all . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-1
Could never get it to work on my kindle fire . Tried many times , it would n't even start the game . Nothing . Deleted it from my device .	-1
I did not like to play this game . It was very hard to understand how to play this game , and you have to buy money to play.If you play Blackjack 21 , and you know how to play it , I think you would like it .	-1
The dealer always seems to win , and things are always popping up so you ca n't even see what you 're doing.Maybe will try it at a much later date .	-1
I was looking for a non gambling game of Blackjack , did not want to gamble . I deleted the game without playing it , therefore I am unable to review this game . Is this enough words for you ?	-1
This is a game for casual players . There 's lots of bells and whistles when you win but players have no ability to change the rules , and the game is intended to exhaust players ' stock of free coins so they buy more .	-1
This was a fun game and I liked it a lot , at first . Then when I would click on it to open the application it would n't open , just went to a black screen . All my other apps work fine so I reloaded it once , it did the same thing so I just deleted it . It was free so nothing lost .	-1
Kind of basic and ultimately boring . I do n't like getting hung up on purchases required to advance - especially in basic games like this . I deleted it ...	-1
The game itself is OK , but the problem is that there are SO MANY ADS that completely obliterate the screen , it 's not worth the hassle . Yes , I do understand that with free apps , there are going to be ads , but I think this one sets a new record for ridiculous . If your kids are using this , be careful to not accidentally hit 'purchase ' when you were trying just to play the game . Removed !	-1
this game is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo stupid ! I was trying to download where 's my water but then I accidently pressed this one ! worst mistake ever	-1
No matter how hard I tried I could not get signed up to get started.Very flustrated . Not for me .	-1
Of all the dumb things to not include in a Twitter app , clicking on hashtags has to take the cake . They might as well take retweeting out too if they think they can take such & amp ; # 34 ; artistic license & amp ; # 34 ; with regards to Twitter . Hey ! How about shortening those pesky tweets to 40 characters while you 're at it ! Even ONE STAR is to high a rating for this app ! HORRIBLE !	-1
UPDATE : Upon deleting the app , it still left several MB on my SD drive that I had to manually remove using AndroXplorer.This app was neck and neck with Seesmic , so I had to get picky.1.I do n't like it when apps ask for access to my data . Seesmic asks for fine GPS data but does not seem to access the low level system logs that Tweetcaster sees , according to the product description.2 . I do like the dark grey theme of Tweetcaster , its ZipIt feature , list creation within the app , and the choice of URL action . Also , it is easier to tell if something 's been retweeted in Tweetcaster and by whom , as long as you recognize the RT'er 's logo.As others have noted , you can post to FB but not read others ' posts . I keep hoping Tweetdeck desktop 's features will be replicated in this app , too .	-1
I did not get on with this program & I am not sure if it is this program or Twitter itself	-1
I didn & # 8217 ; t really use this app . I just downloaded it to try it and I don & # 8217 ; t really like it . It wasn & # 8217 ; t very fun .	-1
I did not care for this game . I play it and puzzle books for some reason I could n't get into it here .	-1
I really do not like the layout of this game or the opening selection screen . I am going to look f o r a better version and most likely delete this one .	-1
This Sudoku is set up nicely and is easy to use , but in the paper mode when you enter several possible numbers , it does not let you know when you have entered a number that is not playable . Later , this error can throw off the entire game and you have to start from scratch . Starting over is not my idea of a fun time playing a game . There are better Sudoku apps available so I have deleted this one .	-1
what is this game about ? ? I do n't get it ! ! will someone explain to me ? ! ? ! ? People explained it to me but I still have no clue ! ! PLEASE DO N'T GET ! !	-1
I downloaded this game and never played it . It was not what I was expecting , so I uninstalled the app . It was okay , just not for me .	-1
I installed a different version of this and love it . This one in particular would n't install so I had to delete it . I am always looking for new ones so keep them coming . Does n't work for android 2.2 .	-1
forever in my whole I have never liked this gamed so I just wanted to try it out but when I got this app it is so so hard how do you people play this game do not get this app too hard ! ! !	-1
Update - Reading the other reviews regarding the pop up porn ads , I have deleted from both my device and my cloud drive . Too bad , a great little game ruined.Very intuitive interface . Having everything all on one screen makes it play very smooth . No pop-up boxes to contend with . Do n't have to stop thinking about the puzzle to enter a number . Have played sudoku on many different electronic formats . This is far and away the best .	-1
I have had other sudoku games that are better than this one . Not as colorful as the others . Okay game for beginners .	-1
I 'm glad the app was free cause I doubt id get a refund ! I did everything , step by step to the letter & amp ; 1/2 way thru things between my kindle & amp ; computer no longer matched what the directions said . could not resolve this issue or get it to work at all .	-1
This began as a great app . But then this morning I open up the app and find all but 4 newspapers disappeared . Where did they go ? Obviously this needs some serious work to fix it .	-1
I like the app but ca n't read the small size font . So far as I can tell , there is no way to enlarge the font as there is with other apps of this type .	-1
on kindle fire app never starts . crashes every single time . used to work ok. now epic fail.forum dipsomaniac loquitor	-1
Everytime I open the application , it forcecloses on me and the furthest I 've gone is just the welcome screen and then all black . I would uninstall but that 'd be a waste	-1
Seems Like it would be neat , too bad it crashes every single time . Other than that minor bug , works like a charm	-1
I I 've rewired to open this app many times ... .unfortunately it never opened..in fact screen goes black and freezes/locks up . Sooooo no good maybe this update will help..samsung galaxy s ... eclair	-1
Does n't support the use of the front facing camera , even though it defaults to it ? Just shows slanted lines on my Mytouch 4g	-1
Force closes at splash screen . Like every other samsung galaxy s vibrant post . Vibrant running bi-wining 2.2.1On my way to twenty words .	-1
The app force closes every time on my Samsung Intercept running Froyo v2.2 . When it starts up it does show its initial splash screen but after a few seconds it crashes and you see the force close dialog - every time .	-1
It looks like fun but it does not work . It crashes everytime I open it . I wasted my money on it . Does not work .	-1
Only works with the back facing ( not front facing ) camera on my HTC My Touch phone . Sots are only B/ W. Color option would be good too . Especially a color lomography or plastic camera style look .	-1
Got to start up screen , then a FC . Second Amazon app in a row to do this ! SGS VIBRANT 2.1	-1
I 'm disappointed there is no front camera support for the motorola atrix . I ca n't even find a menu to be able to choose cameras to begin with . I hope they add support for this phone soon , what good is it having a phone with a front facing camera if you ca n't use it after all ?	-1
Ca n't even open the app on my Vibrant ( Galaxy S ) . It force closes right after the first screen . It sounds like a fun app but over priced . I only tried it because it 's free today .	-1
Not for SGS Vibrant . FC - just like everyone said it would . Bummer . ( Bi-Winning ) FC FC FC FC FC FC FC FC FC FC FC FC	-1
Not the best photo app that I have , but it 's kind of cool to use on my tablet . I 'm sure there are better apps out there . If you find one for free , go for it , but in hindsight , I would n't have spent money on it , Just my two cents . Take it or leave it .	-1
app recognizes a.d takes pictures , but the final strip of pics are just black and white stripes , no images . : - ( Mytouch4g .	-1
Installed the app , a button pops up that looks like it is part of the app that says `` click here '' which starts the scam of verifiedrewards which sends all your kindle info with the link , and you ca n't escape . DO NOT download .	-1
If you are a person to DL several dozen apps in haste and breeze through them then feel the need to clear your memory in a hurry , this is for you . Otherwise , it 's just another step to deleting manually .	-1
the scoring makes absolutely no sense whatsoever . wish there was another go game . cant believe that I paid for this . do n't get it	-1
It 's a shame to give what might otherwise be a terrific app , a bad rating ONLY because of compatibility issues .	-1
Message was that it was no longer available for download . Should be removed from listing if that is a true statement .	-1
A real 8 ball has an equal chance of giving positive , negative , or neutral a answers ( trust me ... I have counted the sides on a die from a broken 8 ball LOL ) .This ap gives 8 of 10 positive responses , 1 negative response , 1 neutral response.The only thing good about the ap is you can shake your Kindle to get a new answer .	-1
This app does n't really work . When I do it , all it gives are yes answers . Every once in awhile there is a maybe , or a not sure . But in all my time of using this app , I 've gotten mostly yes and never no . I would n't waste your time on this app .	-1
I was n't very impressed . The graphics are very cartoony and the & # 34 ; special & # 34 ; characters are just plain silly . If you like baseball and want a cartoon version , it 's fine . If you want a true baseball simulation , look somewhere else .	-1
PLEASE READ : DOES THIS SOUND LIKE `` BANK LEVEL SECURITY ? '' I AM RECEIVING EMAIL WITH LINKS INTENDED FOR ANOTHER CUSTOMER NAMED `` SHARMONIQUE '' ! ! ! ! ! ! ! __________________________________SUNDAY , OCTOBER 16 , 2011 , 1:00 PM : __________________________________PAGEONCE has signed me up and installed the Beta BillPay program module into my account even though I DID NOT AGREE TO IT in the survey email they sent ! The `` survey '' stated ( at the end ) `` put your name and email address in and click 'send ' to join the Beta program . '' I NEVER DID THAT AND I BACKED OUT OF THE EMAIL ! I AM VERY CONCERNED because today , SUNDAY , October 16 , 2011 , I received an email from PageOnce that began `` DEAR SHARMONIQUE ... '' and my name IS NOT SHARMONIQUE . I immediately emailed PageOnce at the email address given because of my concern with someone else 's email being sent to MY email address with LINKS in it to activate the BillPay ! A few minutes later , I decided to open MY PageOnce account , and LOW AND BEHOLD , it goes RIGHT TO THE MAIN SCREEN just like usual ( not notices , install , nothing ! ! ) WITH NO DOWNLOADING ON MY BEHALF OF ANYTHING , nothing ... . then as usual , I click on the little square that shows you the bills coming due . And then I noticed something to my HORROR ... .. Next to each bill listed was a little green icon that you could click that said `` PAY . '' I could n't BELIEVE THIS ! NOW I HAD THE BETA BILLPAY PROGRAM INCORPORATED INTO MY NORMAL PAGEONCE ACCOUNT AND NEVER GAVE PERMISION FOR THAT TO HAPPEN ! I tried to be a nice person and answer their survey they sent by email several days ago , which asked what features you `` would '' like should a bill pay program be available , and I STOPPED AT THE VERY END OF THE SURVEY WHERE IT SAYS `` PUT IN YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS AND NAME TO SIGN UP FOR A BILLPAY PROGRAM WHEN IT BECOMES AVAILABLE . '' I backed CLOSED THE EMAIL ( AND , HENCE , THE SURVEY ) AND NEVER AGREED TO JOIN THE BETA PROGRAM . And here it is , several days later , I get SOMEONE ELSE 'S EMAIL WITH LINKS IN IT TO ACTIVATE BILLPAY addressed to a person THAT IS NOT ME . Why did PageOnce SIGN ME UP when I never gave persmission ? Is Sharmonique 's account now MINE ? And does SHE now have MY ACCOUNT ? ? I CALLED IMMEDIATELY TO THE TOLL-FREE NUMBER FOR PAGEONCE this morning as soon as I saw my app had BILLPAY ON IT with , AT A GLANCE , had MY FULL ACCOUNT NUMBERS ON THE BILLS . A Ms. Kelly Forth answered the phone . She was interested in only getting my phone number to `` escalate '' the problem to Tech Support , even though I asked her AT LEAST 10 TIMES what PageOnce can do AT THIS MOMENT to PROTECT MY ACCOUNT from access should ANOTHER PERSON now have access to MY ACCOUNT . I asked what PageOnce does when there is a possible breach in security , and could she find out who Sharmonique is and whether there was an email sent to HER meant for ME , or can she or someone else freeze my account from third-party access or SOMETHING TO PROTECT ME NOW ! ! ! ! She kept repeating the same canned response repeatedly that it 's `` a Sunday '' and all she could do is write up a report and escalate it and someone would get back to me IN 48 HOURS and to give her my phone number for tech support . So , because `` it 's a Sunday ... , '' PageOnce has NO ABILITY ( at least during MY phone call ! ) to check into a possible security breach and would only `` get back to me in 48 hrs ) ... . They actually want up to 48 hours to do something about this ! Ms. Kelly Forth kept insisting that my `` account was `` safe '' because `` BillPay and PageOnce are two different accounts . '' HUH ? I DO N'T HAVE A BILLPAY ACCOUNT OR SEPARATE PROGRAM ! THE BILLPAY IS INTERTWINED INTO WHAT WAS MY PLAIN OL ' PAGEONCE APP WITH NO WAY TO SEPARATE THEM ! ! ! I insisted over and over again that how could that be when I now have BILL PAY INCORPORATED INTO MY PAGEONCE ACCOUNT/APP AND HAVE NO WAY OF REMOVING IT EVEN THOUGH I ASKED FOR THAT TO BE DONE IMMEDIATELY , AND WAS DECLINED ANY FURTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO PROTECT MY ACCOUNT N-O-W ! ! I even asked Ms. Kelly Forth whether it was advisable for me to DELETE THE ACCOUNT in order to protect it , and would it be possible if she can surely tell me that Sharmonique does not at this point ALSO have access to my account ! And she would not say ANYTHING except `` the only thing we can do is report it and take your phone number for someone to call you back in 48 hours ... '' over and over and over , with NO SOLUTION OTHER THAN THAT LAME ONE . I ca n't even decide whether deleting it myself is proper because now if someone else has my account information , then I HAVE NO WAY TO GET BACK IN TO MY OWN ACCOUNT TO PROTECT IT OR CHANGE PASSWORDS OR ANYTHING , ESPECIALLY TO SEE THE ACTIVITY ON THE ACCOUNT , and possibly a THIRD PARTY DOES ! ! SO NOW I AM STUCK NOT KNOWING AS OF THIS MINUTE WHAT I SHOULD DO , WHY I GOT THE EMAIL FROM SOMEONE ELSES BILLPAY ACCOUNT ACTIVATION , AND WHO GOT MINE ! ! OR WHY THEY HAD THE AUDACITY TO SOMEONE ON THEIR END `` INSTALL '' THE BETA BILLPAY INTO MY PAGEONCE ACCOUNT WITHOUT NOTIFYING ME OR ANYTHING ! AND I NEVER EVEN CLICKED ON ONE LOUSY LINK IN `` SHARMONIQUE 'S EMAIL '' which WAS the email to confirm that I WANTED THIS ! SO HOW DID THE BILLPAY GET IN THERE WITHOUT MY PERMISSION OR INSTALLATION ? ? I CLICKED ON NOTHING ANYWHERE TO PERMIT THIS ! OH ! One other thing I noticed ... . when I was in MY PAGEONCE APP , to get OUT of it , I clicked the backup button on my android ( as you would normally do to back out of something ... . AND THERE WAS A WHOLE SCREEN WITH A NEW LOOK TO IT THAT SAID `` PAGEONCE BILLPAY BETA '' on it with TWO HUGE CLICKABLE BUTTONS UNDER THE `` LOGO '' ... . ONE WAS TO ACCEPT AND THE OTHER WAS TO DECLINE ! BUT it DISAPPEARED IN 2 SECONDS AND went RIGHT BACK TO THE PAGE YOU NORMALLY GET WHEN YOU SIGN IN . I tried it AGAIN ... . WENT IN ... . BACKED OUT ... and the screen flashed VERY QUICKLY and DISAPPEARED AGAIN ! ! ! Now explain to me ... WHY WOULD THE APP HAVE A DECLINE/ACCEPT feature on a `` new main screen '' if you have to SIGN UP FOR THE BETA PROGRAM OTHERWISE only AFTER you have already installed the normal PageOnce without BillPay ? ? ? ? What kind of a trick is THIS ? And when would THAT screen have come into play ? Why did n't I GET THAT SCREEN WHEN I FIRST SIGNED IN ? Because it BYPASSED IT ON PURPOSE when I first signed in , that 's why ! I only saw it when I BACKED OUT of PageOnce and guess I `` tricked '' it into showing me what SHOULD have been or was SUPPOSED to be the new `` first screen '' of the app IF IT HAS BILLPAY BETA INSIDE IT ! WHAT KIND OF TRICKERY IS THIS ? IS THIS THE KIND OF COMPANY THEY EXPECT US TO TRUST ALL OF OUR PERSONAL DATA WITH ON A DAILY BASIS ... WHEN THEY RESORT TO TRICKERY AND DECEPTION JUST TO GET YOU TO BE ONE OF THE MANY GUINEA PIGS THEY NEED FOR THE BETA PROGRAM ? MY QUESTION TO YOU PEOPLE WHO HAVE DOWNLOADED OR ARE THINKING ABOUT DOWNLOADING THIS PROGRAM IS : DOES THIS SOUND LIKE `` BANK-LEVEL SECURITY '' TO YOU ? ? ? ? ? If this were MY bank , I 'D FIRE IT ! ! I AM THOROUGHLY DISGUSTED AT THE LACK OF THE ABILITY OF PAGEONCE TO REACT TO A POSSIBLE SECURITY BREACH BECAUSE `` it 's a SUNDAY . '' PERHAPS INSTEAD OF HAVING MS. KELLY FORTH WORK ON A SUNDAY just to take phone calls from what she says is Los Altos , IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR PAGEONCE TO PAY A TECH SUPPORT PERSON TO BE ON CALL JUST IN CASE SOMETHING GOES TERRIBLY WRONG WITH THE BILLPAY BETA PROGRAM AND GOES HAYWIRE SENDING OUT INFORMATION ON THEIR CUSTOMERS TO OTHER CUSTOMERS and WORRIES THEM SICK TO DEATH ! ? ! ? I WILL CONTINUE TO POST UPDATES ON PAGEONCE 'S RESPONSES ( EMAIL , PHONE , ETC. ) ... . AS they come in ... or IF they come in ... .. and this is what I told Ms. Kelly Forth I would be doing on the App markets review sites UNTIL I HEAR FROM THEM and GET THIS RESOLVED WITH AN EXPLANATION IN WRITING._____________________________________________SUNDAY , OCTOBER 16 , 2011 , 4:00 PM ... ... UPDATE_____________________________________________Nothing . NO WORD . And poor SHARMONIQUE , WHERE ARE YOU ? And do you know what 's happening ? AND THE MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION : WILL YOU BE TOLD EMAIL INTENDED FOR YOU went to ME ... . or will they keep that from you ? And to others who have this program ... . will you even know that email intended for you WENT TO ANOTHER PERSON ? WHAT 'S NEXT ? WHAT KIND OF GLITCH ? Do we find out the hard way when someone gets access and pays their bills with OUR ACCOUNTS ? All this was said to them on the phone today , but as you know , it 's `` a Sunday . `` ... ... Stay tuned for further updates ... .UPDATE ... . PLEASE CLICK ON COMMENTS TO MY REVIEW TO SEE THE UPDATE . I POSTED IT THERE .	-1
This update removed the easy update . You have to go into each account and update . It still has the same functionality , just a little inconvenient .	-1
I just needed something to remind me of my upcoming bills . I spent a lot of time setting up my bills and I liked the interface . However , there is no way to get rid of reminders for paid bills , because the only way they can be dismissed is by selecting to pay them through the apps bill pay system . The bill pay aspect costs money . I have a free bill pay service through my bank . Although it would be convenient to pay right from this app , I do not want to have to pay for the privilege . So I uninstalled it .	-1
Exclusively to download from financial institutions and billers . Can not track cash , enter transactions , or categorize for budgeting/tracking categories . Junk for anyone who does n't have a ton of credit cards or investments .	-1
Ca n't use the settings options without forceclose . Tried this app earlier this week and it would n't even open . Now I can open but ca n't use the settings . Still a bummer .	-1
I 've played this on my android phone and really liked it , so when i got my kindle fire hd I immediately purchased it here . But it 's missing the auto fill and auto pencil feature , for some reason , that 's in the Play store version . Why ? ? ? I do n't know . But I do n't like not having it.I 've since uninstalled this version and side-loaded the other company 's version which works flawlessly on the Fire with all the features . This is another failure for the Amazon app store .	-1
I already have this game on my Mac from the Mac App store , so I 'm familiar with it and have enjoyed it as a quick time-killer . Seeing it available for my Galaxy S , and for free no less , seemed like a no brainer.Unfortunately , the game is broken . When getting a bonus jump the game freezes for ~30 seconds ( I timed it ) about half the time . And every time I reach the High Score banner it locks entirely , requiring that I hold down the power button and reboot the phone.C'mon , guys . The game is n't that complicated . I *really* want to like the Android version , and I hope that an update comes out soon . Until it does I 'll be leaving it installed , but wo n't be playing it and certainly would n't recommend it . : - (	-1
this game is fun at first but the more you play it the more boring it gets yawwn . wound up deleting this app east of time .	-1
Total rip off of the original ninja gaiden for sega and nintendo . theres a level where you do this and it looks exactly the same with the same concept . sneaky bastards	-1
I was going to get this game , but I was looking at the reviews and they did n't look to good . I am using a kindel fire , and I do n't want it to crash ... so ... I do n't know..	-1
Grandson at age 10 did not care for this game . It is clearly for younger children without much action . Do n't let this deter younger children from trying it out .	-1
you just jump from one side of a building to another . I did n't find it fun , but you might . it 's free , so it does n't cost you anything to see if you like it ... although I did n't . I did n't find it crashy on my fire . I also did n't find angry birds fun , but I do like fruit ninjas and bubble busters , just so you know my taste in games .	-1
I dint get why this game has so many good ratings . it is exremely simple and boring and kinda dumb .	-1
not what i was looking for . u need to input the foods and work outs u do if u walk u need to input how many step and so on dnt like it for that reason	-1
Thank God it was free . I called Kindle tech support because I could not get the app to work . I was informed it is not compatible with Kindle HD . Very disappointed . Instructed by them to delete app . Unable to rate this app fully .	-1
As others have said , this does n't work on an unrooted Kindle Fire . It acts like it does , even reporting several apps it was unable to remove from default startup . Too bad it failed to report the other 20+ apps it claimed to have removed , without succeeding on a single one . The app itself uses 25 MB of RAM ; that 's a lot for something that does absolutely nothing . Glad I only paid for it with Bit Coin funny money .	-1
Each time I open a game a white knight is missing . I can not play without it . I 'm out $ 2 for a game I ca n't play . I want my knight !	-1
I would have gotten it but I don know how to play dis game . I like checkers . Its not confusing like chess be .	-1
This game is not as good as I like . It will not make your move even if a legal move at times . It seems to lock up so no I will not recommend this to anyone .	-1
1st j.j comings is a name and this game sucked beyond suckish games you should not get it what I did you know I da da da da da downloaded then I opened it and I 'm clicking the blue and then the green buttons and it just keeps going back and fourth click this okay so you know I 'm clicking and clicking till I realized this game os pure bull crap I do n't mean to use fowl launguage for all the little ones but it sucked	-1
This game is extremely dumb and if u download it you will regret ever getting it . All it is is a button that says `` press here '' , flips to a new page that has the same exact thing ! ! ! ! Do NOT buy this app .	-1
Not going to download if it needs permission to my contacts , seems like its a little too much to ask for to play some game .	-1
My phone has work contacts that likely would not like the spam that could result from this permissions mess . Will not download until this is changed ! Glad this did n't cost me anything since out was the featured app	-1
I would give a higher score if Survival Mode worked . I have contacted the creator to find a solution to my issue . Works fine on Motorola Droid 2 on Verizon .	-1
i didnt read the permissions since i assumed amazon would not be shady but seriously ? access to my personal info ? uninstalled . ( twenty five word minimuum )	-1
I downloaded it just to see if the reported permissions are true . They are ! I did n't follow through with the install , and now I ca n't get removed from my Xoom 's pending installs in Amazon Apps . Follow my advise and stay completely away from this app and developer ! Shame on you , Amazon for supporing this debacle .	-1
why does this need so many permissions ? it is just a game . well I downloaded it because it was the free app of the day then became scared away due to the permissions needed .	-1
When I try to install the amazon appstore force closes on me . All of the other apps I have tried on amazon have installed fine . Not sure if the problem is with the game or the appstore .	-1
How can anyone call this app free ? Yeah you see lovely trailers and clips of movies but everything else you have to buy and/or you ca n't use without Wifi ; what a burn ! For those of us who has to watch our budget we need free to be free , ya know ?	-1
It requires an ID and password or tying to your Facebook ID . I did not want to try to remember another ID and password plus I did not want clutter up my FB account with this . So I never logged on just removed from my Kindle . IMDB is much easier and less evasive then this app .	-1
I wanted to like this more then I did . i did n't . I took it off the same day . Might have been better on another player .	-1
I have this on my computer and kindle fire hd but I ca n't get past the rate page . It keeps telling me I need to pick one more . Very irritated .	-1
How can you not have HD streaming on the awesome Fire TV ? The Fire TV version of this app is equivalent of watching a VHS tape . Get with the times please . Add HD streaming and I 'll add stars to my review .	-1
I suggest to not get it because all you watch is previews.I think it is boring and all I saw was previews of shows .	-1
Movies by Flixster is an app that sounds good but is not . They want you to believe your movies are free .	-1
I really like this on my phone.. but not on my kindle fire because I ca n't log in to my Google + . I ca n't access the movies I own on it . please I would love it if you could fix that . Or make it happen	-1
Well I already had a Flixster account when I decided to add this App to my tablet . It wouldnt recognise my sign in so I deleted it from my tablet . Flixster needs a Fixer .	-1
I love the app ... There is an issue I have.. I ca n't watch any movies that I have on my Kindle Fire HD or on my android phone . I was corresponding with customer service technicians to resolve the issue . After several correspondence , they never responded back to me . And that 's been months ago . I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app , and still having the same issue .	-1
I got this because I was told it would work with the free movie download I got with a DVD purchase . It doesnt ' work correctly on the Kindle Fire . To do anything I needed to accept the terms and conditions but could n't do that but covered the screen with the terms and conditions beyond the screen size to I could find the close button . Basically I 've never really be able to use this app .	-1
If I hatnt bin chilling . I wulda been lyk wah . BUT THEN it wad n't all that bad . 2 strz for dis appz !	-1
Writing a review crashes the app . Sending a crash report is impossible due to & quot ; not a valid email & quot ; and crashes . List 10 movies in Want To See and get a free movie gift . Well I have 17 listed and guess what no movie . My advice is do n't waste the time getting the app . Big disappointment .	-1
I wish there was one , just one app that u did n't have to create an account just to watch movies . I also wish u did n't need Wi-Fi . I ALSO wish it would be free : ) ' Please app store just one	-1
do n't know how this got on my kindle ... never bought it ... wonder if it came with a game ... and three more words required	-1
When I put in a UV mogie code , it said that I was illegible to continue as soon as I got done . Then the next day , it let me get on , but it gave me a totally random movie . Im dissapointed : /	-1
Well this app made me very angry . I tried to sign to create an account and it would n't let me . I tried using my Facebook to do it and it told me that I already had account , which I think I would of remembered that ! ! ! ! Uninstalled it ! ! ! !	-1
I do n't use this app was n't sure what it was when I downloaded it , Not anything I would use at this time .	-1
This App is annoying because it periodically looses your account & password information . It uses your email and a password you choose . If you forget your password ( since many of us have multiple accounts and passwords ) this app offers no way to reset/recover your password so access to your ultraviolet movies loaded in flixster is lost .	-1
is this rely the best app NO IT IS THE WORST APP IN THE HISTORY OF APPS . oh by the way I saw one SHORT LITTLE MOVIE for $ 21 . !	-1
Nothing more to day There really is nothing more to say beyond that . I have removed it from my aps .	-1
Limited ability app . Another example of how disappointed I am in my KFHD . Amazon : you should be embarrassed you put this out .	-1
Can someone tell me why you would download this ? what a waste of time..thought is was another movie site to use	-1
I needed movie times for this weekend . This app did not deliver . I tried two different local theaters . No movie times whatsoever .	-1
We have a theatre that was upgraded 5 years ago to 6 screens and completely modernized with stadium seating at it 's same location . It 's called the Foothills theatre.When I plug in our zip 82716 your program finds it as Gillette Wyoming . Then I click on use current location and the first option becomes `` ca n't find your location '' and no theatres appear.This is on the Kindle fire , if that makes a difference . Other location dependent apps like weather find my city location without a problem.The Fandango app by the way only finds a 2 screen theatre that has been closed for the previous 12 months .	-1
I will stick with Amazon free movies and bargain priced videos , also Netflix for free viewing and rental and fast easy searching for movies seem a better deal . This program left me wanting , Sorry !	-1
It was a Grimm season and I only got like half the episodes ! Problem is not resolved so anyway I wasted my ultraviolet on something that did n't work . Next time I am going to try vodu ? is it ? We will see .	-1
This one was slow to load the program onto my Kindle Fire and then would n't run . I tried downloading the movie , not downloading the movie but to no avail . Not worth anyone 's time .	-1
I did not know how to use this so I uninstalled it . Sounded like it would be useful but I guess I can live without it	-1
I found it difficult to get the app to do what I wanted it to.my tablet is for fun and if I ca n't even log in because the system is not acceptable to the information I know I put in then I will remove it before I will spend a lot of time dealing with it . There are better app 's to listen to music on .	-1
I did not like it and deleted it from my device	-1
It would be nice to use this , if it connected with google accounts . Not the apps problem , its amazons problem .	-1
Sorry that I downloaded this app . Not at all what I expected . I thought it was some type of home recording software . It is mainly homemade pod-casting . If that is your thing , then this is for you . It was not for me .	-1
I actually puchased this game and it does n't operate correctly at all . When I contacted the product 's designer/distributer they said it was old and they did n't support it anymare . Then why the heck are tey selling it ? ? ?	-1
the game is priced great at 10 cents . it looks great it even seems to have the potential to be a decent game . only problem for me is that it does not seem to be able to hit any target at all . no matter how on target .	-1
Hard to play . Bad graphics . And the concept of killing deer while they stand there is sick . Too bad I ca n't give zero stars .	-1
I could n't get this to load so can ; t tell you how good or bad it is . Grandson wanted to play it but was unable to .	-1
This app is too dumbed down . Try the other calorie counter apps ! My fitness pal blows this out if the water .	-1
It tries to count calories by the specific food item that you eat , rather than you doing the math and inputting the numbers . Which can be nice , since not all restaurants provide calorie information , but for someone who does not eat out and has all the numbers available to input , this product is really ineffective . Comparing the numbers the app calculated for my food to the actual number of calories I had eaten , they were always significantly off .	-1
For one , it says you can only install the app on one device . That means someone with a phone and a tablet or ebook reader is violating the & quot ; agreement & quot ; you see only after buying ( sorry , & quot ; licensing & quot ; ) the app.Then later , it also demands the right to spy on you and track you online.Absolutely unacceptable .	-1
Game is n't bad , for a while , a SHORT while ! Then your forced to buy things to make the game continue and it does n't get too far into game before this happens .	-1
this is a good game but first the graphics are absoloutly terrible and the jerking motions do n't really work out on a larger device .	-1
This app used to be a valuable tool for me to decide which movies to see . However , they have updated the app twice in the last ten days and now it is useless . I select movies or theaters . It does n't matter which , and the app immediately crashes , giving me a & quot ; Fandango has stopped & quot ; message.A useless app until their tech people can solve the problem . And yes , I am using the most recent update , installed on 10/16/13 .	-1
Even though this is listed under Apps for Kindle Fire it is not compatible . Kindle lacks the Location Services of the Android OS that the Fandango App needs to function . Things like GPS , WIFI Location Detection , etc . Everything you try relevant to location of sign-on will fail making this app useless on a Kindle .	-1
not really a needed app . we do n't go to the movies as often as we could so it 's probably not as helpful for those who do n't watch movies often .	-1
I find this app cumbersome and slow . I usually end up just going to Yahoo Movies to get the showtimes .	-1
Maybe I 'm not using it right , but it just does n't work for me . I just wanted something simple to see what is currently playing at the local theatres .	-1
Even if you try to set the location manually , it fails because it still tries to use GPS on a device that does n't have it . This is even lamer than the Fandango website , which is also broken .	-1
When I plug in my zip code 82716 or my city of Gillette WY the only theatre found is the Skyview which has been closed for the last 12 months.The foothills theatre is nowhere to be found . The foothills is the primary theatre in town with 6 screens.I do n't know if it matters but I 'm using the new Kindle fire .	-1
It 's an `` alright '' app if you like these kinds of games . Graphics arent the most stellar . Music and sound , as well as vibration , CAN be turned off . Its `` acceptable '' in the accuracy department . But what makes this app annoying is NO EXIT BUTTON when you want to CLOSE IT . Players should not have to back out of the game , only to then have to go to Settings , Apps , Manage Apps , scroll to find Bonsai , click it , scroll down to press Force Close , then back out of that until you hit the desktop again . If I want to fiddle with 3 or 4 games when I have 20 mins to spare waiting somewhere , and ALL the games did this , Id have several of them sucking up phone memory all day unless I performed this Force Close routine ! If Im in a doctors office , and they call my name , I should be able to EXIT immediately and not have to annoy other people while I say `` wait until I back out of BONSAI and screw with the Application setting so I can CLOSE this app '' Makes it so this is the app I WOULDNT whip out with a few mins to spare ! Thats why its a one star app after the appropriate star deductions , because I wouldnt use it as a time-killler app . Thats what most little diddy games like this are used for anyway , and now that has changed . Put an EXIT BUTTON in , and I 'll adjust accordingly . It was a three star app without this oversight , so I took off 2 stars because I wont play it before I play others that DO have the courtesy of including the exit button . Note : I played 3 levels , so dont yet know if it will start acting screwy after playing more levels , like some mentioned .	-1
really is impossible to play for the colorblind . please make a colorblind mode for the colorblind people ! colorblind people unite !	-1
I paid for this app and deleted it 10 min . later . There was a quick walk through guide but it had way more things on it than I wanted to use . May be helpful for someone that has a ton going on , but I 'm a mom that runs everyone around and it was still too much for me .	-1
It was not the best out there but It also was not what I was looking for that 's why it got a low rating .	-1
I have tryed to open this and it wo n't I might just get rid of it all together . for now .	-1
Not bad in terms of how it is designed to function . However , in a matter of days , the repeated and almost constant shutdowns become rather hindering and defeat the purpose . You ca n't complete especially replies , because the app locks down . You get a blank / black screen , and then you 're transported - so to speak - to your Kindle hone screen . I wo n't even bother with bogging down my memory with the fix-its . Very counter-productive . So I deleted it . Moving right along .	-1
It did n't work at all and it caused more than one freeze . I will stick with a different program I found that works much better and is far more stable .	-1
Actually , it only half way functions . Reading emails is not a problem but if you try to reply to an email it fails . About 3 seconds after clicking the reply button to go to the text entry screen the app automatically goes back to the inbox page . This makes it mostly useless . I only give it 1 star because the system wo n't allow mw to give it none .	-1
I have to say that the app works well enough , but I just did n't like the way it was set up . I 'll check on the app in the future .	-1
This is such a nice app with so many nice features . Unfortunately , it has one fatal flaw : It wo n't let you answer an email ! ! ! ! You go to answer and begin to type and the next thing you know you 're shunted off to another screen . And apparently this app has been broken like that for many months without being fixed ! Admittedly it 's free ( with ads ) , but crippled like that it 's still overpriced since it wastes your time . As it stands , this app is a disgrace to both its developers and the Amazon Android app store .	-1
Easy to install and setup , and has good and easy to use features , but crashes much to often . I had to uninstall it and get another e-mail routine in order to process my mail ...	-1
MailDroid is a rip off because if you are connected to the internet it says : connection loss.By the way : it did work before but it stopped working . So i highly caution away from it .	-1
I did n't like it because it seem like it was not accessing my emails correctly . I would not get all my messages and I got several error messages when trying to send the emails .	-1
Okay , so I was looking for an app that allowed you to play the violin , like the piano ones . I play violin at an advanced level , and I thought it would be fun to have a virtual one . So I found this ... thing . I thought you would be able to do something with it ... but all you do is you click a button next to a picture of a violin and it plays the same song over and over again . Its actually pretty stupid ... I would not recommend this to violin players .	-1
I downloaded this app as it was the first one on the list for dictionary 's ( playing a game of Scrabble ) You enter a word and it gives you the word along with a choice of languages ... that 's OK. What 's not OK is the fact that you have to look halfway down your device ( Kindle Fire ) for the word and its definition ! The upper half of the screen is advertising ! ! ! Just did n't suit my needs . Can you say , & # 34 ; Hello , Miriam Webster Dictionary ! ! & # 34 ;	-1
I purchased this dictionary for various reasons . I play Scrabble for Friends and other word games ... .I thought that this dictionary would assist me with various words and definitions of those words . But I ca n't figure out how to use the dog gone thing ! It 's a little frustrating to not be able to use it . I am considering deleting it from my Kindle . FYI ... I just went on my Kindle and played with the Dictionary and finaly saw how to get the information you would need to make the thing work ! It looks like you will need to play with the app to figure how to input your word or how you think the word is spelled and on from there . Looks pretty simple to figure out ... I may edit my review of this app at a later date .	-1
I thought this app was very useless and did n't help at ALL do not download this app even though it is free you will regrt getting it	-1
I love this app I am a college student and use it ALL the time . It uses the word in a sentence . The only thing I would add is an audible definition .	-1
It stopped working all of a sudden , saying it was out of range . Uninstalled and reinstalled , but no fix . Developers were unresponsive . Ca n't recommend it without adequate support . Look elsewhere .	-1
Like the app and its concept , works well when configured . The BIG problem is excessive battery drain , it 's killing my battery life , so , unfortunately , had to turn it off . Droid bionic .	-1
Needs to use language/terminology in the menus that the majority of users will understand ! Really , guys , if this is an app for the EXTREMELY tech savvy , it should be marketed as such ! I suspect most users just gamble with most of the settings just to see what it does ... or MEANS !	-1
Why does a simple app that turns off my screen need to have permission for access to everythng on my phone .	-1
This app sucks . Most of the time it does n't work . NOT worth the price and I got it for free .	-1
I read the reviews and thought this would be great . Noticed my battery would be nearly dead by the time I got home , which is unusual . Saw it was using 87 % of my battery and promptly installed .	-1
I REALLY wish this app would work for me , cua definitely something I 've been hoping for , but all it did was freeze my samsung mesmerize ( unrooted , running 2.3 ) over and over again . I had to uninstall . ; I 'll be checking back for updates , I hope it will eventually be something I can use !	-1
Worked for about 30 minutes before locking up phone . Rebooted my Epic4g and took almost 10 minutes for phone to load . Seemed like a good idea but program is either problematic worth phone or another program I am running . Either way , i uninstalled and phone works fine now .	-1
I wanted to like Screebl , I really did . It was the free app on my birthday , so I gave it extra attention . I installed it and waited until I was somewhere quiet to watch the video . I adjusted the settings over and over and over again . But I keep finding my phone active in my pocket . That 's just not gon na work . As for saving battery life , I already keep my phone at 15 second timeout , so Screebl ended up wasting my battery , not saving it . In theory , I could set the `` on '' parameters to be so narrow that I would have to work hard to keep the phone in that position , but I swear that my pocket would find a way to carry my phone that way . Uninstalled.Two stars . One for presentation and one for effort .	-1
the title says it all ... never worked never worked ... what else can I say it just never worked..never never never never . And what 's with this minimum of words to review ? ? ? ? ?	-1
I tried this app and just do n't like it . I would have to have a book of directions and just do n't have the time .	-1
App will load try to search app closes what is up with that ca n't update or anything . Do n't waste your time or money .	-1
I 'm not sure why adding a way to listen to specific URL streams is such a bing problem for these & quot ; streaming & quot ; app makers . I hope a smart app maker fills this void and eats their lunch . The & quot ; streaming & quot ; apps I 've tried thus far are all garbage because they do n't have this feature .	-1
Did n't have the material I was looking for in podcasts . Good for mainstream media , but not specialy ( like knitting ) that I was looking for .	-1
i am having a lot of trouble with these '' kiddie '' games.i wish i could find a more adult type of game , not dirty , but more for an older person .	-1
I am a long time user on the Ipod touch , and it was my most used app , but just switched to a Fire HD.The Stitcher app for the HD crashes when using the settings button and has other signs of instability.They replied to my inquiry but I am surprised they do n't know that you CA N'T download a new version via Google Play ( as they suggest ) on the HD.So here I am stuck .	-1
There are enough other podcast apps that I dont need Stitcher invading all the nooks and crannies of my device looking for personal info . Its got spotty reception anyway and doesnt save my settings no matter how many times they 're saved . Stitcher you deserve less than a star . Remove your permissions and update some software for an updated review .	-1
Might just be me but I ca n't figure out how to save a particular podcast as a station so I can go there and get it . When I search for it and find it , I 'm only offered one episode ( the latest ) . Then when I try to click & # 34 ; past episodes & # 34 ; nothing works the way I think it should . Anyway , it 's probably just me .	-1
this game is extremely bland , boring , uncreative..its just plane bad . there wasnt one time during my experience with this game where i was entertained or amused .	-1
It 's far from good . Nobody in their right mind would charge $ 4 for this though . It might be worth $ 1 , but it feels like a free game .	-1
My samsung captivate handles nearly every game perfectly but the framerate for meteor is abysmal . Not only that but it jumps between lagging and normal so you do n't have time to react top the change . extremely frustrating . I got it for free from amazon otherwise I would say that this game is not worth a cent	-1
i used to have the free version from regular android market and it was fine . i downloaded this and like many people i have intermittent slowdown ( lag ) and randomly the touch sensitivity sucks then goes back to normal . not good for a game where it means you lose . I guess that 's why the give you 10 lives . its not my phone b/c do n't have touch problems or lag on any other game I 've tried . even 3D object ones . Droid 2 .	-1
After seeing these guys made easytether , and how well that works , this game was incredibly dsappointing . It worked fine on my droid 2 but at no point was I having fun .	-1
Quite boring and unremarkable . not worth the space it takes in my phone . This has been done so many times in the last 30 years , i do n't know why developers still try to make products out of the theme .	-1
First off , I love old school type games for touch screens . But this brings stiff animations along with unresponsive controls and no background music make this a pretty dull game all around . No effects to speak of and just plain not that exciting .	-1
If you follow the on-screen instructions , this game throws you right into the middle of the action without the slightest explanation of what the heck you 're supposed to do . If you pause the game for help , you 'll soon find your SOL . It 's almost like they tried to hide the main menu from you . If you go back to the homescreen and press the menu button you 'll find your instructions , options , and high-score boards.The default control layout is silly , forcing you to awkwardly hold your phone at an angle or cover half your screen . If you navigate your way to the options menu , you can change the shooting buttons position to the lower right-hand side of your screen , however that only fixes half of your problems . For some reason , both aiming and propulsion is done from the same joystick , meaning that in order to aim at an enemy ... you have to fly straight at them.Graphics are meant to look retro ... but they look like they were actually designed nearly 30 years ago rather than looking like a nice tribute to the graphics of yesteryear . They 're also quite bland , excluding the nice backdrop the game has . Music and sound effects are likewise . Retro ... yet bland.The most obnoxious part about this game was that it would not close ! I even used the exit button from the hidden menu , but after many minutes had past , the background music was still playing on my phone even though I was now staring at my homescreen . I reopened the app , navigated to the menu , and hit exit again ... and the same thing happened ; and kept happening until I went to my phone settings and force-stopped the application.Overall , and underwhelming and annoying experience . If you can get it for free , might as well try it out , but if it 's no longer the free app of the day , take your money elsewhere ! There 's plenty of better shooters on Android.-1 for poor menu design-1 for bland graphics/music-1 for poor controls and default setup-1 for not closingFor more of my game/app reviews and the full review for Sinister Planet , look ! me up at exm.nr/anthony-orale , I almost always do an extensive review of the free app of the day !	-1
old school is good but not when its not modernized a bit , controls are terrible , needs to be better , beef up the graphics a bit	-1
I found this game to be ok. Gets old pretty quick . Good time waster on a plane or waiting for the dentist .	-1
Sound from shooting is obnoxious . Music countries to play once you exit game , have to force stop to stop it . Control is a joke , shooting isnt responsive as should be . Installed	-1
This game is pretty similar to Blasteroids , a graphical update to Asteroids that Atari did in 1987 . This has some unique features , like challenge waves and clearing waves by picking up gems whether or not you 've destroyed all the rocks.Unfortunately , while the onscreen analog stick gives it a responsive feel like Sinistar , there 's still no excuse for not providing physical controls in a twitch game like this . If this had Game Gripper support or just remappable keyboard controls , I might have even been tempted to pay for it . As it is , with my two thumbs covering part of the screen , I 'm just glad it 's free today.The menu system is confusing . I thought I was paging through the awards and instead got thrown into the game and could n't change options until I quit . Think I 'll dig out my old Blasteroids disk and try to get it onto an Amiga emulator ...	-1
Why is there no sound option ? Also the controls suck . The upper right needs to shoot and aim and be twice as large	-1
Why in the world would you put one control in the lower left corner and the other in the upper right corner ? Uninstalled , HTC EVO 3D .	-1
Just downloaded the app because it was free never played it Does n't look like fun at all . Maybe I should play it	-1
if you spend so much time removing apps that you feel you need an app to remove apps , you 've just discovered your problem . you spend too much time adding nonsense to your phone.the only semi-useful function is removing multiple apps at once , which you only only need to do ... if you spend too much time adding nonsense ( like THIS ) to your phone . the fact that reviewers glossed over this function to pretend like this app adds something you could n't previously do makes me think they are nonsense lovers.save yourself a little space , stop putting silly things ( like THIS ) on your phone and use the normal built-in method of removal ... and discretion about what you install in the future .	-1
I feel sad every time I think of this app . why . because I dont like it . my 14 cats do n't like it and my mailman wouldent talk to me after I bought this app . thanks a lot ! sarcasm	-1
if you get this it stinks its making you throw paper that 's it just take my word for it once again dont buy it	-1
this app gets boring after a long time and its a waste of time playing so do not please do not get this app I am begging you please	-1
We tried this for a bit but the kids become bored with it very quick . At the same time for it being free you cant expect it to be great	-1
All you do is throw paper right , left or in center to try to get it in a waste basket .	-1
A boring game . All you do is throw a wad of paper at afilthy trashcan . If I could rate this app 0 I would have.I deleted this game 20 seconds after I got it . And it is junk on any appliance especially for a kindle fire.SOOOO BORING ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
This game would be more fun if the fan did not blow the paper balls away from the wastebasket . Other than that the game is OK .	-1
I only know how to play the stupid version so I may not be the best person to ask . It is my hope that this will get Amazon of my back with regards to product reviews .	-1
It might be fun but I ca n't figure out where the instructions are & I do n't know what I 'm doing .	-1
I was actually looking for the solo version of Mahjong . This one does n't have a single player option that I was able to find .	-1
I like a simple game of mahjong . this app wanted to do too much . I 'm an & # 34 ; old lady & # 34 ; i do n't need & # 34 ; stuff & # 34 ; to press , push , hit , sign ... . deleted it almost immediately .	-1
The review said the game could be in english or japanese but the start up is japanese and all the help menus are japanese so I could not figure out how to play . I deleted it .	-1
I thought this would be a good game to have since I do like the previous mahjong type games I 've had in the past . BUT NO INSTRUCTIONS ! ! ! I went to their website and the menu titles are in English , but all other information is Japanese . What good is that ? If these people are going to charge $ 4.00 for a game like this , at least they could provide instructions in ENGLISH . I did get this during the faotd offering , but if you do n't know how to play multiplayer Mahjong , do n't waste your money on this one . This game is being deleted until they decide to provide instructions . Oh , and no , I should n't have to search the web for instructions to a game that has a $ 4.00 price tag , as some others have suggested . Going , going , gone !	-1
the worst app is this one were in the world do you find the music anyone who says this is bad agree with them	-1
do not get thus it is horrible and non useful so please save the money and do not buy brace yourself and do n't waist space on ur kindle or phone	-1
This app does n't show you how to download or get music on it ... I want to know how but there is nothing to tell you how ...	-1
Not worth the download.Interface confusing.Song Files are not likeable nor interesting.Creators need to put a bit more though into it !	-1
Ok listen the description made me think that this app was amazing . Also everyone who said it was what they were looking for made me want to buy it even more but now that I did its not worth it . It does n't really how to use it the description is TERRIBLE . It does n't work and I ca n't figure out how to use it . So please do n't waste your time checking out this app .	-1
I wanted a app that I could download music this is a app that plays songs already downloaded on to my kindle	-1
I hate this app u do n't get any good music . It put artist . Together that should not be together . I have deleted it looking . For something . Better	-1
android is horrible it does n't search for any music it just gives u some random music like i got a couple Spanish songs and i cant erase them	-1
I decided to give this app a try because I generally enjoy retro 2d shooter games . Before installing , I noticed that the only permission the app asks for is vibration control , which is fine . Opening the game takes you to the simple start screen and the only option is to press to begin . Seemed odd that there were no instructions or options at all . Played a couple times to get the hang of it . Literally , played twice ... then I was bored . The second time through I realized that nothing changed and there was nothing to work forward to.The game has decent graphics , mediocre background music for the style of game , okay controls that tend to lag when things start to speed up . The kicker , however , is that there is nothing that makes me want to keep playing ; No level upgrades , no achievements , just repetition.It 's a good start , I 'll give it that . But the game mechanics need some serious work . This app needs to go back into the oven for a while . I 'll check back later to see if this app becomes more developed that just some half-baked free app .	-1
Test devices : Samsung Epic , Android 2.2 officialViewsonic gTablet , Calkulin+Clemsyn 1.5ghz Froyo Combo V6To put it bluntly , Space War HD is one of those mediocre titles that someone slapped `` HD '' on to make it seem better than it really is . A top down scroller , Space War HD is just one of the crowd , with nothing special to offer and lacking in many areas . The `` HD '' graphics are , well , not so great . Sound effects ? None . It does have two background soundtracks to choose from , which are decent enough . The controls are pretty responsive , but are finger or trackball driven only . Options for Space War HD are very minimal , there is no help section , and there is nothing for online score posting.On my Epic , it ran just great . Everything worked as it should . My tablet though was a whole other story . Space War HD failed to scale up properly , leaving smeared graphics along the right and bottom edges . The soundtrack failed to ever come on , making the game that much more dull . The final nail in the coffin was that it loved to force close . Ouch.After having reviewed so many games just like Space War HD , all of which are free , I ca n't say I 'd recommend spending the $ 1 to get this title.I hope you found this review helpful , and if not , feel free to leave comments/questions .	-1
The game installed fine but lacked any game play that would keep me interested . plus , I had to play with no volume because the voice overlay kept repeating in a broken loop . Played for 5 mins then uninstalled .	-1
First thing that jumped out at me was the fact that the music is from Beverly Hills Cop and I thought & quot ; I wonder how an android app that costs a dollar can offset the cost of an expensive royalty fee from a hit 80 's movie. & quot ; I would n't be surprised if this game gets pulled for that song.As far as the gameplay goes it is an OK game but it is repetitive and lacks any real substance . What starts off as a fun game quickly becomes a stale space waster .	-1
The game is very laggy , even before any thing but the ship is on the screen . It would be nice to be able to decide when to us the power ups , since they are usually grabbed when not needed . The game is just another top down shooter , but could use some serious improvements for everything besides the looks .	-1
This game is really boring . Over-simplified and the controls feel laggy . Played a few rounds and uninstalled . Not even worth free .	-1
Droid 2 - powerup announcements repeat forever , overlapping themselves . controls lag . other than that , good game that i can play with one hand while waiting for my baby to go to sleep . fix the issues and ill play it a lot .	-1
On the Infuse the easy setting computer will win almost every time even if you score in the 200s every game .	-1
works good on my froyo ( Epic 4g ) and gingerbread ( Nexus S ) phones , but not on my honeycomb tablet ( Toshiba Thrive ) .	-1
Good graphics , but interface is n't the best . It is difficult to get the ball to do the same thing each time . Gets boring fast .	-1
I start playing the game and suddenly I 'm back on my app selection screen . No matter how many times I try playing this game all the way through to the end , it would not happen . Finally I am fed up and have decided to take it off my Kindle Fire HD . I wasted money on this game . Would not buy again .	-1
I accidentally purchased this with 1 click which I have turned off for everything except for the appstore it would seem . The game is ok , but the physics are off . You can set the bombs in the same place and just blow them up several times and get a different result each time . The auto zoom when picking up a bomb is extremely annoying though , if there was an option to disable that it 'd be a 3 or 4 star game . As it is , there 's no way to see the full structure when placing a bomb as it zooms in as soon as you pick up a bomb , and if you want to see the whole structure you have to manually double tap to zoom out after every bomb . And unless you have a really small screen , mines only about 3 inches , a LG Optimus V , bomb placement does n't look like it 'd be an issue zoomed out.So if the developer is reading , please make a quick update to allow the auto zoom to be turned off .	-1
My 25-character Yahoo ! password -- valid in Yahoo ! Web -- gets truncated by Trillian . The app has no value to me without proper password-handling for all services.Here 's the thing : Developers , of all people , know the importance of strong passwords . If you do n't build into your app the ability to handle appropriate security measures , it demonstrates nothing more than cynicism and laziness.FAIL	-1
Does n't connect to my chat services on Kindle Fire HDX . I have MSN/Skype working on my computer , but this wo n't let me stay logged in , it automatically logs out after signing in . Weird bug or just not functioning , but I do n't use the actual Trillian messaging service ( which is the only thing that works ) so I uninstalled . Also really wish this came with Google Hangout support ! Since Google Talk was eliminated .	-1
With a $ 5 price tag and positive reviews , I decided to see what the hype is about.I 'd never used Trillian before , so my review is based purely on the Android experience.The UI is simple and basic , the way I like it . But customizing options are surprisingly few . And then soon the contact list becomes filled up with `` Orphaned '' statuses at random spots.Account management is a mess . Adding accounts and loading contacts can be a hit or miss . After disconnecting an account , I could still see its contacts lingering in the Trillian list.Grab it while it 's still free ( Apr 16,11 ) . There 's no way the $ 5 is justified .	-1
I have used Trillian for years on my computer to ease the multiple sign-ins for messengers , so I was really happy to see it available in the app store for the Kindle Fire , since there is no messenger platform for the Fire that I know of . This way , I figured I could have my Yahoo ! Messenger on my Kindle Fire . Unfortunately , I ca n't get the app to work for me . It will download it , but I get an error message every time I try to install the app . It 's not like I 'm doing anything wrong , here , since all I 'm doing is clicking 'download ' , waiting until it 's done , then clicking 'install ' and I immediately get the message . I 've deleted it and tried to re-download , several times , and the same thing happens . I did n't do any research to see if maybe it 's not supported on the Kindle , but just in case someone else like me hopes it will work , I figured I 'd at least leave a review letting folks know I have n't been able to get it to work for me .	-1
For a product that 's been around for more than a decade , this is sad and a little surprising . Very problematic with long , secure passwords . Also crashes frequently on LG 760 . Further , requires registration for trillian account and requires verified email address.Not worth the price nor the aggravation .	-1
Can not figure out from the interface how to setup my irc account . That was the reason I downloaded it and it 's not working out for me .	-1
Will not allow username creation . I tried multiple nicks , then tried them with random numbers after them . Still would not let me register . Not worth a download .	-1
I Really do n't like this app because it does n't really make a difference for what it 's worth , $ 4 . 99 is alot of a money for a subpar app . This app is n't worth the time or money	-1
Pic say pro is a much better & quot ; enhancement & quot ; tool . This app , I 'm afraid , is not going make it in my collection .	-1
It works , but only has four or five options and they do n't do much that the basic camera app on my phone already has installed . Nowhere even close to the five dollar price tag .	-1
I installed this , but it says it stops when I launch it . So sad . I love this kind of game . Afraid to install verse 2 when verse 1 does n't work .	-1
I love adventure games -- games with exploration , puzzles , etc . But also , games with a & # 34 ; positive & # 34 ; spin . Infernus is ... well , weird . I could n't & # 34 ; get into & # 34 ; the game , the interface was not as intuitive as many others , and the theme was & # 34 ; dark & # 34 ; . ( I should have known , from the name . ) Plus , I had difficulties running it on my Motorola Xoom tablet ( running Android 4.1.1 ) . There are too many other good games out there , so I did n't really spend a lot of time trying to figure out all of the problems , but just uninstalled it .	-1
I downloaded this game app onto my kindle fire . Download was fine but it would n't open . Kept saying ` game failed ` . Might try to download again if it gets fixed .	-1
Promising opening . Good graphics , spooky Atmosphere , then nothing happened ! I wandered around trying to figure the damn thing out forever . And then it stopped working because I uninstalled it . Best decision I ever made .	-1
This app was a great idea . It organized all of my cards from my wallet . However , no scanner at any store could read my phone screen . ( HTC Desire )	-1
There is no rule that says a retailer will use your phone , instead of their card , ( or whatever is standard practice there ) I would n't try to coerce a cashier to use this anyways , unless they are specifically promoting its use there .	-1
This is a terrible app . I wanted a simple little game to distract myself sometimes and I was tired of solitaire . I usually like bowling games , so I got this one without even looking . It 's awful . As someone already said , the first level is fine , if a bit boring , but once you move on to the Tilted level , you completely lose control of any element of the game . The ball already starts at random spots and you have no way to move it where you want or need it to be , but Tilted just makes it even worse . The ball is slow and very little you do influences its movement . Response is sluggish , the instructions are bad , you ca n't opt out of unplayable levels . I tried it like 3 times , then uninstalled . Believe me , you do n't want this game unless you thrive on frustration .	-1
the controls of this game made no sense , no matter what I tried the ball did n't follow any type of logical path	-1
This game is a total waste of time . There is no excuse for the poor controls . And why the heck is there wind in the bowling alley ? This is a terrible excuse for a game and is not even worth being free .	-1
Test device - Samsung EpicGameplay - Simple brick breaker type game where you bounce the ball off a pad and break bricks lining the top . This game has a pad with hooked ends which allows you to guide the deflection of the ball with a bit more precision.Controls - You control the pad movement with your finger . Tracking was a bit jittery , not precise as it should be . There is an in game toggle for the sound but no pause button . Sound can be turned on and off during the game or before you start , but the button is n't very responsive while you 're playing.Graphics - Yawn . Simplistic at best , about the quality of and Atari 2600Sounds - Only two sounds total and I found myself turning the sound off fairly soon.Stability & Performance - Overall , the game did not play smoothly . Watching the ball move , I could see a jerky motion to it , matching my experience with moving the pad around . Sounds did n't come in at the right time consistently . Game crashed out the first time I attempted to post my score.Extras - You can post your score to a global leader board . Leader board is divided into Day , Week , Month , and All Time	-1
If it were back in the days of atari this would be great ! However , this is 2013 and Atari is dead and is unlikely to successfully be reborn . This is way out of date in this day and age and l know that after my one game this app was never used again .	-1
I bought this app to do some online school work on . What drew me to it was that it supported Windows word files , meaning I could upload a paper I had already been working on and add to it or complete it . Well as you are typing if you begin to delete a word it will try to spell correct the word as you delete it making it time consuming and frustrating to say the least . The Windows word compatibility only works for using our editing an existing file . Once you save it the file can no longer be used in the Microsoft word program . So all the work you did hoping to only have to be done once will in fact have to be done over again to save it to a usable word format . You are better off to use pen and paper as you 'll have to write it twice anyway .	-1
I need the language diversity it comes with . This one is very helpful through the text predicting feature . Still , I find it hard to understand and learning how to copy and paste ( most important for me ) has been up until now , impossible . No user 's guide to consult . HARD !	-1
does not operate with our i10-50 Tablet ( Android 2.3 ) - do not know why it kept crashing it . After 3 freezes , I uninstalled it .	-1
Dont use a task killer , the newer versions of android dont need them . One reason not to have them is that it can potentially cause problems with the way your device operates if you kill processes that dont need killed . when apps are not being used on your device , they will automatically be killed .	-1
Sorry . It did n't work well on my Nexus 7 ( Android 4.2 ) . It was supposed to kill programs ( difficult to exit completely in the Android system ) . But it did n't . I had to go through the process over and over , and then sometimes it might kill a program -- but not always . Finally I uninstalled it .	-1
I really wanted an app the shuts down apps like Google Play and Amazon 's Appstore and MP3 . I see no reason for these to be running all the time and chewing up my battery time . Advanced Task Manager shuts down these apps , but they restart . I 've loaded other apps that claim to prevent these apps from restating upon startup , be they do n't work . I 'd be happy to hear from anyone on apps that actually work to prevent these types of apps from starting . Thanks .	-1
I have used this app on my S3 without problem for a while . When I made the mistake of buying the ad free paid app first for my new Kindle Fire HD , I found the the kill/no kill list is visible fo a half a second and then it vanishes . I replaced it with watchdog . Try the free app first ! ! !	-1
I tried this game many times , and CAN NOT figure out how to play it , to win . I do n't see the instructions for it anywhere .	-1
Unless you 're asking fairly basic questions , Wolfram Alpha does n't work any better than asking the same question in Google or Bing . Bing actually works slightly better with complex questions . e.g . Attempting to quickly calculate the irradiance at 1 inch from a source with irradiance of 100,000 microwatts per square centimeter . Wolfram Alpha returns definitions & amp ; statistics on the word 'source ' or other useless trash . Rephrasing the query dozens of times results in nonsense . Faster to run the formula manually using the calculator app .	-1
first and foremost , why it forces you to use that garbage keyboard is beyond me . Second , either I do n't get it or its some sort of a calculator because it never seems to have an answer for me . I asked it what the marketing mix was , nothing . Asked it how drifting was scored , gave me a bunch or useless stuff about just scoring . For me , this is worthless .	-1
Two stars simply because it sounds great . I do n't know why certain Apps fail on the HTC Thunderbolt ! I hope this gets fixed . You can view your search ... But you must ensure a crash each and Everytime you do a search than reopen .	-1
worked fine until the last update , now not only force closes with an error saying to redownload app amazon , but also crashes phone.needs to be fixed very quickly.I 've seen apps crash before but not ones that this your entire os with it .	-1
Do not download if you are looking for Xbox one . Ps4 . Wiiu cheats because it has none of them	-1
I could not make this app work for me . I can not recommend it to anyone that would like to share internet access .	-1
I bought this last year . I went to use it today and it said I did n't own it . Then where in the heck did my money go . I have a record of buying this . So pls beware when you buy an APP , it can be taken from you . What a bunch of B.S . I think it is time to stop buying Apps ! ! ! ! ) - :	-1
I personally did n't like this product and I uninstalled it . I found it hard to use on my phone . Otherwise I use Kayak on my laptop without a problem .	-1
Says its in my apps.. but its not in my apps . Oh well . Guess not then . : - ( disappointed . Guess I need to find something else .	-1
This app is not worth all the hype ! I prefer Priceline or Hotwire more . All travel sites do the same thing in my opinion . Do n't waste the HD space for this one .	-1
Probably a fine product for major airports , but leaves something to be desired when working with less important ones ( BDL , TPA ) . Too , there are no written instructions available and product support has not been very helpful .	-1
This app is very boring . Not to much to hangman though . Glad it was free I would be upset if had to pay for it	-1
this is to hard .do n't buy it you 'll regret it it is also boring . that is just my opinion . : ( sorry . !	-1
Never could get this to really work on my DroidX . Just kept tapping the letters to no effect . Deleted app in frustration . Maybe an update will fix it ?	-1
Maybe close , but a simple check of table top with phone pointing set one way was NOT the same when phone turned to point opposite direction .	-1
This app does n't work correctly on my Xoom tablet . The `` glass '' is vertical , should be horizontal . The bubble works but is very inaccurate . Ca n't comment on any other devices .	-1
table top calibration yields 0.8 degrees and keeps flashing back to landscape . landscape calibration throws off flat calibration by 90 degrees . vice versa for portrait . never stops moving at all . needs filtering to smooth measuement . raw sensor input is less accurate than real level .	-1
I thought this app would speak the text instead it reads the text ... I do n't have to speak to read a text..I thought this app would allow me to speak and the Kindle text it for me , then all I would have to do is send it ... this was a waste of space on my app page..	-1
As others have pointed out , you have to have a Google voice app to make this work on the Kindle Fire ... why is Amazon promoting Google Play apps ? Lunacy ! I have removed this app from my Fire ... thanks but no thanks .	-1
Guess I got a bad download because now my phone has turrets . It is constantly barking obscenities . And If I try to turn the volume off it threatens to tell my wife about a coworker . Thanks a lot .	-1
I can find no use for this that is convenient , so removed it .	-1
Decided to download this during the free app day release . The game lacks serious polish and fun . I ca n't imagine paying any money for this game , as I was bored and quit after 30 seconds . The game play is different ... . But not better than other similar games .	-1
And it 's not even a particularly good one . Really , you can find better ones for free any day of the week .	-1
The game is innovative as far as jewel puzzle games go yet I would not pay for it.The problem with this game lies in it 's extremely poor graphics.The game has movable tetris like pieces that contain jewels . The game requires you to line up three or more jewels to clear them . It then grays out the area dropping more jewels into place.The object is to gray out an entire tetris like piece to clear it ( similar to the alchemy puzzle game ) Once again the game is unique but the lackluster graphics make it borderline unplayable .	-1
The idea or concept of the game is pretty good , but that 's about it . Dev , needs to work in the visuals , graphics , animations , color ( they are a little dull ) . If it gets better visual , I 'd definetly recommend it . For free is nice ( not good , cool or awesome ) just nice . Hope to see a better version , that actually is worth $ 2.00 . Just constructive critisism .	-1
It is an imitation Gmail app . Functional , and in my opinion extremely primative . Not recommended even though it is free .	-1
The current version is 4.803 , as of this date . The version offered here is full of bugs and has n't been updated in 2 years . K-9 is a very good mail client , but you need to use the current version . Unfortunately , you may end up side loading the current version from the Google Play Store .	-1
Was easy enough to set up my email accounts and compose an email , but once I finished writing the email there 's no SEND button ! I 've looked thru all the program settings , tapped everywhere on the screen , tried everything I can think of , and can find absolutely no way to actually SEND . With so many positive reviews for this app , there must BE a way to do it ... ..so why ca n't I find it ? ? ?	-1
I LOVE THE SCREEN SHOTS but actually getting a picture to look like them , forget it . There are different functions but I ca n't seem to grasp it .	-1
Half the letters are hidden on the 7 inch tab , so I could n't play . Not quite sure how it 's tablet optimized if it does n't display on them .	-1
Even though it 's a paid app it tries to get you to spend even more money by buying dumb things you do n't need like more hints and time boosters . And when you click on the word to see what its definition is , it takes you to a screen to start a free trial of a merriam webster unabridged subscription . The UI is lacking , but the gameplay is alright . I often found myself accidentally pressing the wrong button though . It 's okay as a free game I guess . Subpar in every way . Uninstalled .	-1
Again , you Scrabble players will be frustrated . All those nifty three-letter words , the ones that win games ... Well , they are deemed wrong here . Sometimes Greek words are OK , sometimes not . Sometimes & quot ; ism , & quot ; for example ( by no means the only example ) , is correct , sometimes incorrect . The game needs some work , needs to be more consistent . I find it boring and irritating . I 'm deleting it .	-1
Not the app for me . I tried it out , but did n't really care for it . Other people may like it , but not I .	-1
mediocre game . mediocre graphics . guess they call it retro to make the lame graphics seem intentional . does not support moving to SD card . unacceptable . uninstalled .	-1
another tower defense game just like zdefense I know a person should n't ook a gift horse in the mouth but Damn again there is so many games out here as well many other types I would love to have the job of picking app for the FAOTD as well testing these apps out then I bet every one would be happy I would say more how this process can improve but I do n't want to give my ideas out for free n yeah right to the fake 4-5 star reviews these games are boring n no fun after a few mins of play	-1
... but so far , not impressed with this one . Retro , I suppose , but game play is really lacking , and the whole game interface really stinks . Glad It was free , but wo n't be on my phone for long .	-1
I had this app on my Android phone and my kids played it all the time . So I was excited to find it on Amazon apps for free . I intended to put it on my kids ' device so they would stop playing with mine ! LOL ! It downloaded and attempted to open , but it never really would work . I kept getting error messages and it would freeze up the device .	-1
I tried this app on my Motorola Xoom , the first thing I noticed was that this app is n't optimized for tablets . The graphics look severely pixelated . The second thing is that I needed to turn my tablet 90deg to the left in order to make the boat straight . When I switched to non- accelerometer mode , the boat went backwards . There was no way to make it go forward , auto accelerate was turned on . Auto-pilot is useless . Devs , this app has serious potential , fix the errors !	-1
worst game on history never get this game its horrible WARNING : SAFTEY HAZARD NEVER GET THIS GAME UNLESS AND I REPEAT UNLESS YOU WANT TO DIE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
I agree with the other reviewers , the controls are very difficult to use . The graphics is n't as great as I thought .	-1
Great idea . Unfortunately UNinstalled ... No progress visible . Finish a workout and the main menu still looks the same , better write down your own progress . Also , you must leave this app open and running on the screen to keep tracking . I let my screen time out and go black and the app automatically paused the app . Wish it would work like the ipod version ...	-1
I heard and reviewed about this app that itis bad for your phone . First off , it drains battery like a mother while it & quot ; kills & quot ; apps . Second , it lags and freezes your phone . My step brother has this app on his Android and his phone CONSTANTLY freezes and glitches and shuts off . I try to tell him its not the phone its the stupid person holding it but he does n't believe me . Google had done studies and they said if you have ANDROID 2.2 OR HIGHER , YOU DO - NOT- NEED THIS . It will screw up your phone and you need to have high ram . If your phone freezes , this app is why . Again , my step brother uses this app EVERYTIME hes done playing a game or doing something on his phone , and it freezes and shuts down and crap . He even complains that it does , but he wont listen . Your phone is n't the stupid one - you are .	-1
these are valid points . there is absolutely no reason this app should need to know my phone id or have internet access . just look at my running programs and shut down the run away apps . decided not to install	-1
Shortly after installing this app , my calendar widget stopped displaying my calendar . Checking the running apps in the settings , I saw that this app was using more than 14MB of memory . Uninstalled the app and everything is fine again . Unrooted Verizon Droid X .	-1
on the free one it heaped loudly and it scared me so much I do n't like this app so do n't get it and I mean it	-1
I did n't find myself using this application at all . So many modern phones have easy to use standard applications that make ending applications a breeze .	-1
I monitor this app using Battery Monitor Widget ( Free ) and it uses about 350mA . when I removed the app , my phone uses only 50mA.Bad app ... .	-1
I did n't even get to play the game that 's how bad this gamenis for your kindle fire . I do n't known about you guys but I deleted it right after I saw it said force close .	-1
Everytime I try to play this game it just stops unexpectedly and everytime I turn it on it the farthest I go is the title menu . I never even played th actual game before ever on my kindle fire .	-1
Very poorly designed ! The fights are WAY too difficult , and the K.O Kid is constantly getting punched by attacks that I 've dodged ! I also do n't understand why holding down the block button does n't keep you blocking until you release it . This game should not have been released with so many flaws !	-1
I waited ten minutes for the resource pack to download and when I finally got to play my kindle froze up and I had to wait until it was dead before I could do anything else . it sucks severely .	-1
this game sucks I cant even play it on my kindle it is so bad I will have to uninstale it it will not let me play or touch the screen	-1
controls suck . can be changed to full touchpad ( no shaking required ) but lags . did n't see any ads . way too hard to get up from being knocked down due to laggy controls . has potential but as is , not worth the time .	-1
I turned it on and all it is is a bunch of faces.DO N'T GET ! It is not a good app .	-1
Frost wire used to be the go to torrent down loader when lime wire was shut down . But it seems the downloads take way too long and I just like KAT much better .	-1
I 've deleted this from my Kindle as it 's proven to be more headache than it is worth . Long download times that are frequently stopped/paused/cancelled and SO many misnamed files , it is ridiculous . I realize that issue is out of their control , but it tells you something about the quality of offerings available . Do n't bother .	-1
Not very user friendly and hard to use . Would not recommend to friends or family members . good idea but not good	-1
This is a bogus app , keeps asking to update to latest version , only to bring me back to the App store , and there is no mention of a & quot ; Major Upgrade & quot ; . Have not been able to transfer files between devices . It 's just a viewer and audio player .	-1
I could not get this to work on my kindle . I might not know how to use it so it may just be too complicated for me . I removed it and just decided to use pc for all file sharing . I do n't want to risk something happening to my kindle by downloading malicious files .	-1
Did n't like the idea that you can only download music but can burn it using it on your kindle , use to using this product on a desk top .	-1
I like Frostwire , do n't get me wrong . Frostwire is a great download site but not so much for the kindle Fire . It is just not set up for it I guess . Everthing I tried to download would start and then error . Oh Well..Guess that is what a laptop is for lol	-1
I wondered why it was so cheap to get a crappy little camera app . Then I saw the permissions . You do n't pay for it in money as much as you do by giving the app unnecessary access to your personal information on your phone . It 's a small price to pay when you need an app to lower the quality of pictures on your phone 's camera .	-1
If I had actually spent money on this app I would be requesting a refund . If you were able to customize the effects then it might be worth the money but only when you get rid of the unneeded permissions .	-1
What is with this permission crap ? Full access of my personal data and contacts so you can sell it ? A camera app ? What an effing joke . If you installed and got robbed , you deserve it for being stupid . On the bright side you can then sue Amazon .	-1
I was pretty excited to see a camera effects app as FAOTD . I immediately downloaded it , but when I went to try it out it started going crazy before I even got to take a picture and really test it out . It was causing my flash to rapidly open and close for no reason . I also do n't understand why it needs to mount and unmount storage devices . Really strange . I 'm sure this would be great if it worked properly though . I actually bought Paper Camera last night . Well worth the half off price of 99 & cent ; . I spent about 30 minutes playing around with it after purchase . It has awesome looking filters/effects . It 's easily the best camera app I 've ever had . Hopefully this one will get a few upgrades and become better . DROIDX	-1
I have a D2G , and I know about the shutter sound problem , and I disabled the sound ... but as soon I took a picture , and I got a warning from a different app that this app tried to unmount the SD card . I uninstalled this POS as quickly I could ! This is disappointing , because the filters looks cool , but I do n't want to risk damaging my phone while the SD is constantly being accessed .	-1
Shutter sound never ends , just keeps rapidly clicking like chattering teeth . Turned off sound , then had to fc even after exiting program.Effects are ok , but very few would ever be useful . I 'm not much into tinting pictures blue our brown , or overlaying a checkerboard on them . Maybe canvas or chalk drawing if I want to conceal someone in a picture or my picture was out of focus , but otherwise I dont see much use.The programming issue plus the lack of need for something like this makes it a pass in my book . Will uninstall , sorry .	-1
Really sucks for my kindle . Does n't work well with it . Might be better on another device . Dont get if you have a kindle	-1
This is another game you have to play on the web or use your hot spot . Does n't download and unable to play like other games .	-1
This APP should n't even be an APP , I have not been able to see any of the videos , not even when I first downloaded it to my kindle.Its stays stuck on the title ! ! I am so DISAPPOINTED with it . I have a 2 yr old who I wanted her to enjoy watching the videos , but to no avail ! I say do n't waste your time or space on whatever gadget your going to put it on ! It does n't even deserve 1 star , I rate it zero stars .	-1
This one did n't work on my kindle and I do n't know why but I have to delete it . it did n't show videos	-1
This is not an app I recommend . It is only frustrating and drives me nuts . Definitely not my favorite app .	-1
this was a waste of time and space for my device . have no actual use for it . i wish i could delete it from device completely .	-1
I did not like the way this game played . It was too small and too difficult to play . I deleted it from my tablet .	-1
I wasted my time uploading this , playing it for a while & then removing it from my Kindle - poor fatd	-1
The graphics are good , but the game play is horrible . the game is n't very sensitive to tilt and the game is just plain boring . Not worth the 99 cents .	-1
As stated by another review , the tilt can not be adjusted on Motorola Xoom . Remains at a 45degree angle regardless of tilt adjustment . Will be uninstalling as this makes it too difficult to play .	-1
Well , that sucks . I have an Asus Transformer tablet , and the tilt does n't work unless I put the Tablet in portrait mode . of course the screen does n't rotate , so I can play the game ... Sideways.You would think that since the Amazon app store has been around for so long now that app developers would pay a lot more attention to their apps and make sure THE APP WORKS before letting it be the faotd . But they do n't . Maybe Amazon should change their policy to not pay a developer for a dl of a faotd if it gets a 1 star rating . It 's nice to have free things , but it makes the developer look incompetent and Amaook bad when they do n't work .	-1
I got this for free and thought it would be a great game . Not for me . It was odd and dull . Sorry !	-1
You have got to be kidding me ! Maybe if the controls worked however dodging trees is not my idea of fun .	-1
Why is the playing field tilted ? This game is impossible to play with a tilted playing field , controls do n't work at all . This one of the worst games I 've played . Might be a fun game otherwise .	-1
Ok , I 'm running through a dark creepy forest , and ... ? I wll give it good marks for creepy music and the flow of the graphics they were n't choppy as I 've seen from some games . But come on , that was it ? Seemed too basic of a game for my tastes.Not a 5 star but not a 1 star either	-1
the calibrations on the game was not good and you could not turn down the volume , but when you did if you ran into something it turned it back up .	-1
I got frustrated about 2 minutes into the game . The tilt calibration does n't work . Will wait for update and try again .	-1
On my Kindle Fire , the visual game tilt is very choppy as is the tilting.This feels like an unfinished game . On my Fire , it 's not really challenging at all and there is very little replay value . Perhaps this title was designed for children or older phones with small screens and perhaps it 's more fun in those situations.There really is n't much `` game '' here . You automatically move forward and you have to tilt to avoid trees . The other mode consists of pushing the screen to move forward and letting go to slow down . Or in the last mode , collect powerups.I like how it successfully captures a creepy vibe , it does this pretty well . However that 's the only thing it really does do well.I 'm glad it was Free App of the Day today otherwise I would have regretted buying this . There are many great apps selling for 99 cents .	-1
graphics look stretched for the large screen . tilt is wrong . up to go left , down to go right . if axis were correct it could be more interesting . Motorola Xoom .	-1
Downloaded it to the Kindle Fire , played for about 20 minutes on all settings then deleted it . The graphics were good and play was smooth . It just got repetitive and old after a few minutes . The graphics do n't change so you 're just running through the same stuff - trees , bush , headstone . The music is also grating on the nerves after about 5 minutes of constant looping . But hey , it 's free today so try it and see what you think .	-1
it is very boring and pointless . It is almost like a running man version of minesweeper . I do not recommend it .	-1
You 're running through a forest ... dodge , dodge , dodge , you pass some stuff , hey look a grave ... YOU HIT A TREE !	-1
Do n't play this game if you are prone to motion sickness . The tilt action will bring on the nausea . But the graphics are nice ( for the short time I was able to play it ) so I 'll give it an extra star . I imagine it would get boring pretty quickly , though . Luckily , I got it when it was the free app of the day .	-1
Loads fine but when it stats the screen tilts about 45 degrees and no amount of tilting or rotating would get me going in a straight line .	-1
I 'm glad I got this free today . There is little point to this game . I played it in all three modes , and no game lasted as long as a minute . Do not spend money for this .	-1
The biggest issue with the app is that they do n't always update their content with the leading stories of the day . Their content really lags behind what 's being reported on TV . So , I give it a `` fair '' rating . Hopefully , it gets better in the future .	-1
Worst ! ! ! Do n't buy . I got it and then after 2 minutes I deleted it . It said you had to buy the version after seven days . It is not free ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
its kinda dumb on the kindle cause u can already protect the apps like a diary with a password ... or u can lock the whole thing ... not hard ! if u have a child use parental protection . if u dont know how ... google it .	-1
Like it says ; lite means light weight and expires in one week . Not much use . Has some basic function such as password protection but app is trial run which expires . I bought the paid version i 'll review separately .	-1
did n't have any of the information that i was looking for . this is not even worth the download , look elsewhere .	-1
I have used this product several times and I have yet to really figure out what it does . The only thing I know is that it shows me that I really do have contact with the GPS satellites .	-1
Struggled to get it load properly on my Kindle . Lots of screen flips and glitches , even though the game seemed very interesting .	-1
first off it was a great app . however I saved important time sensitive information and when they did and upgrade I lost EVERYTHING . I emailed them a few times and not once got a reply . not even a sorry we cant help ? so apparently if you do have a problem with this app you will never get help . Worst customer service ever and I now refuse to keep this app . I would rather pay then deal with this app .	-1
I simply do not use this fine program . I really do not spend much tablet time . I mostly use a desktop computer so I reallu do not need this fine program .	-1
do n't like it ... ... ..got rid of it ... .not for me ... ..if you like it than great ... ... .end of review ... ..have a nice day ... .I 'm out of here ... .	-1
I bought this app from my computer for my kindle . Could n't find it to install it . Since I could n't find it , I do n't know if it 's any good or not . I 'd love to use it if I could find it and install it .	-1
I had to pay for something that wo n't download to my kindle fire . If it is not meant to be on the kindle fire it should not be on my app purchases to buy . I use my kindle fire for work and this would have been good for me to make short notes for my business while traveling . If you can tell me how to download it please do .	-1
If you 're looking for a quick , easy , and simple app for jotting a note , move on . This app needs a tutorial to get started . There is another colorful sticky-note style app out there for those who want simplicity .	-1
It 's misleading to say they allow cloud sync with the option of registering through your email instead of having to go with one of the other options of allowing them access to your Facebook or other SN accounts , when once you choose the email registration option they direct you to a page that allows you only the option of linking your account to Facebook in order to have access to their cloud feature . Being in my Facebook for what ? To data mine . I do n't think so . And so you are now deleted . Delete .	-1
WANTING TO UPDATE HERE , BUT WHY ARE PEOPLE SAYING IT DOES NOT INDICATE THAT IT SAVES YOUR NOTES ? ? ? WHO WOULD UPDATE AND WANT TO LOSE EVERYTHING ? ? HAVING THE CAPBILITY TO SAVE DATA IS SOMETHING YOU LEARN IN BASIC DEVELOPER 101 CLASS ! NEEDS FIX PRONTO ! ! !	-1
Kindle fire user ... tried it ... then I found ink pad notepad app ... works much better ... .deleted this one	-1
Iwas looking for an app that would give me scores from teams that I like . this does not provide this .	-1
when I first go my smart-phone , I thought I needed an app for everything I do . Wrong . Not only does this app not work most of the time , but it 's useless as the info it provides is a joke . If you really want to keep up with ALL of the NCAA , all you need to do is open of the NCAA web site ( it 's the name dot com ) and instantly all the scores are available along with rankings that this app also ca n't seem to show . Once you open the web site , just save it as a book mark on your desk top and it 's just like an app but works much faster and has a ton of more information . Another HUGE plus to doing this is that you do n't get flooded with ads and your phone is not data mined by an app that cares more about making ad revenue than making an app that actually works . You can also use this web link to check on any sport the NCAA has .	-1
This software does n't respond well , and needs improvement on it 's calculations . It 's not user friendly , and is very difficult to get your finished calculation when trying to use an interest below 5 % .	-1
I would so so get this game if it was free ! Why does it have to be a paid app ! They are just losing customers this way and that 's no good . So why should they want anything to do with it ? Honestly !	-1
It does actually keep high scores , but simply replaces the top score over and over . It would also be nice if there were more backgrounds and if they could be chosen randomly .	-1
The word lists on this app are random and had no theme . I do not care for this type of word search . I have removed this app from my device .	-1
I just sent h an issue report regarding this game but I 'm not sure if I will get an answer . I really like the size of the letters bcause I have big fingers but the main problem is I ca n't seem to get past the first 4 words . No more come up after I find all of the words -- -only 4/5 . What am I doing wrong ?	-1
when adding high score very difficult to go back to the game . also not very good at understanding start and end of word .	-1
... But this one is a little hard to navigate . I recommend a using a stylist with it rather than trying to play it with you fingers on this game	-1
The words are hard to find so i do n't like it . Plus , when you do find a word it is hard to circle !	-1
Not great , not terrible . Does n't save your high scores - only fills the top spot . Long way to go just to be rated good . Hoping for improvement soon .	-1
Have n't used as I do n't know how to get to it . Maybe someday it will appear . Make it easier to find Amazon .	-1
It was entertaing at first but then it started giving me random letters instead of actual words . For Example I got Sth as a word . What kind of word is that ? Not worth it .	-1
to me its easy . but thats the problem . its so easy that it gets really really boring . there should be an easy medium and hard mode . i think this is on super duper easy	-1
It keeps sticking , not responding and does n't work.I like word puzzles , but unfortunately this is not one , I 'd keep using !	-1
Mucho que desear , es muy basica y solo tiene palabras en ingles , para la KF HD 8.9 el formato de letra es muy peque & ntilde ; o y poco personalizable	-1
This too would n't install properly for Android 2.2 . If it would install without error I would very much like to download it again and give it a whirl . I always did love wordsearch .	-1
Was n't pleased with this game . Not enough words and the words were too easy . Needed to get a different puzzle & up grade it as well . Thanks for trying though . Just not for an adult .	-1
I had difficulty keeping the letters lined up when I found them so i could get credit for it . The stylus would slip and the letters forming the word did n't line up so I had to start over again ... no fun . This finally began so much of a problem , I deleted the game . It might be fine for others , but it just did n't work out for me . It became more frustrating than fun .	-1
I have removed it from my Kindle . It was very hard to use . Highlighting words was difficult and sometimes impossible . It was also very easy , more for young kids than anything .	-1
The upper two or three rows of the letter box are buried in the top banner and unreadable . The letter box is squeezed in the top third of the screen . This is unusable .	-1
You have a little time to waste , give this a try . It almost seems too easy . Not something I feel compelled to play .	-1
The app gives you like 8 words at a time in a small area of words which makes it really easy . There are no levels . I would personally download something else if you want a word search .	-1
Total waste of time . Horrible interface , poor gameplay and words . Avoid at all costs , even free . Word selection interface is horrible . Nothing redeemable about this game .	-1
Did not care for this game . Did not find any part of it to hold my interest . Do not recommend to or for anyone .	-1
This game is just too simple . The graphics are nice , gameplay is user friendly , but it takes less than 2 minutes to complete a game .	-1
Ridiculously small and unusable .	-1
This game was way too easy even at the hardest level . Maybe okay for children . I would not recommend this game for anyone over the age of 4 .	-1
Had to remove it from my kindle because it is kinda too small for my likes and too easy . ...	-1
You cant see all the words you need to find and I have a Nook Tablet ... .Sooo not worth it ... and its free	-1
I love word searches an so do my 6 and 10 year oles so I downloaded this app . It 's ok as far as word searches go but two things I do n't like ... first , they use words that I think are unessary like sex or hell . There are enough words in the English language you could use without using words that parents may not want their miss to & quot ; search & quot ; for . The second thing is the words could be spread out better.There is a third thing I should add , the game sometimes has a problemregistering the word you cross off . we ha e had to cross a word up to 4 times to get the gae to accept it.Parents , beware .	-1
I thought I was going to really enjoy this game but it was so frustrating when I would rub my finger over the letter and it would not let me use it . It worked on my letters but not all of them . Does not matter if you press hard or light either .	-1
I bought this one before I purchased another ... did n't like this one ... not in color , letters were not block letters ... they looked handwritten , and was a little hard to work with ... I would n't recommend this one to a friend ... It may have been free for download , I do n't remember but I deleted it off of my Kindle Fire..and got a different one .	-1
I found some words but they would n't highlite . It is really maddening when you find a word and it wo n't highlite for you . I only did one puzzle because it upset me that I found a word and it would n't give me credit for it . I finally got it to highlight and I had one more word to go and guess what . It would n't highlite it . So I just shut it down .	-1
Looks like it would be a good time killer but the puzzles are way to small and some of the letters do n't fit on the screen ... un-installed it .	-1
Last week I did a word search game with a friend on her smartphone . It was a lot of fun . I downloaded this game hoping to repeat my good times . This game was extremely simple and offered few words to search for . I am extremely disappointed in this game , and plan to delete it very soon . I know that this game was free , but it is not worth playing .	-1
Another app removed cause require network to even play it . Glad I had one already that not require such a stupid thing . If you not like having Wl Fi on all the time , then not recommend .	-1
I enjoy word searches especially when there is some interesting music or some twist to the game . Its nice to see if you can beat your old time . This WordSearch just did n't have the oomph that a good one offers .	-1
Started off okay but then most of the words I found would not highlight . I could figure out no reason why ? Done with this game .	-1
Format was very hard on the eyes with chalkboard background and faded white writing . Played a few times and deleted it !	-1
doesnt work . said it synced with my account but never entered any information.wo n't allow adding information or snyc . rip off .	-1
I would n't recommend this game but it was ok for my first app the graphics are n't to good either ... ... ..ok who am I kiddin the app sucked ... ... .do n't buy ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
Nice little app for the Velocity Micro T301 Cruz 7-Inch Android 2.0 Tablet : ) Not many on here are compatible because of the limited amount of RAM on the tablets , but this one WORKS , it just tries to stretch the wallpaper from the 1st screen to the 5th , centered on the home screen . : )	-1
This app is really good for the ipod touch but not good for the tablet ! . the pics are so small on here ! and it didnt even . work	-1
its so much fun but on my kindle fire I made more 10 and they disssappered from my gallery and it takes for ever to load	-1
It does n't work . It does n't even let me make a guy it just crashes . It is the worst app , out there . At least it 's free	-1
If you use this on your Kindle for an avatar of something , it will be black . I would only use it to play around with . Not recommended to use for an actual avatar . Sorry . : (	-1
it keeps deleting all my people and progress , and purchases . keep the idea , remove the problem , it keeps exiting out and almost never works./	-1
When I tried to play the game and it was loading I was n't working it just went to a white screen and said weemee has stopped If I can put this on a Scale 1-1000000 I would put it on a big fat 0 so I recommend to not get this app	-1
I had this twice already and I thought how it will be better well I thought wrong . when I tried to create one it kept on saying Sorry !	-1
I have used wattpad on my phone for years and I used to love it . With their new and improved version , you can no longer read offline and even when trying to read while online it is so glitchy , it is impossible to get through a book . I finally gave up and no longer use this app . Even if they fix the horrible glitches , what good is it if you ca n't use it offline on a tablet ? I want to be able to continue reading whatever story I am in the middle of no matter where I am .	-1
The app downloads . I open it . I search a topic . I click & quot ; more & quot ; to see more search results and it guess back to the home page . I have re downloaded at least 10 times . Same thing happens each time	-1
this sucks cause it lets people search you and find you ! ! ! this sucks . wattpad sucks ! I hate this and I dint even log in and it gave me an account .	-1
didnt like this app at all ... .dont recommend it ... ..didnt really understand it all the way , so i only recommend it for interested parties .	-1
I cant even explain how horrible this app is i mean it is all of the books were about sluts and sex and there was not one decent book that they had to get that was appropriate and on top of all that they dont even give u the whole book they just have the first part of itv and then right when it gets good they just leave u hanging so yayh unless u like sex scens DO N'T BUY ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
i love wattpad do n't get me wrong , but i ca n't log on with the version on amazon , i have no prob with the one on android market . I have the same problem on my mytouch . this is an issue for me because I keep a reading list of all the stories I 'm reviewing . an earlier version of this app did not have this issue .	-1
I have not used this app , so I really have nothing to say about it either way . I found it hard to deal with .	-1
There are many sorry stories here but they are difficult to read how the set up is for scrolling with the books .	-1
not worth the option to let my kids play , too much risk of downloading junk ads and other problems.. .	-1
k sooo I have n't played this app but it looks stupid . WHYYYY is it so hard 2 find good apps . also wish that every app was free . EVERY app . thanks	-1
the game boss COPIED fancy pants wow what 's a sucky loser this game needs to be banned not cool delete ifyou have rate 1 star or ZERO STARS !	-1
I do n't like anything about the Kindle fire I do n't like not having access to the FREE google store for apps . I prefer the Ipad over the kindle fire any day .	-1
its great for cleaning apps because when itried to clean my apps with another app cleaner it did not work nut this one does huh I like it even my wife loves it	-1
Application loads and then crashes immediately and it does n't report the information to the developer like the other applications due . Therefore the developer has no way of knowing how to fix the application in the future . Basically this is a fatal flaw in the development cycle of the application . As such this program will never improve . As such the program has no hope . I have 800 apps and it 's loaded on Samsung galaxy S4 with a 16 GB SD card almost every other program of the 800 work fine .	-1
This did not work for my phone -- still have things I am trying to get rid of . Too bad - nice idea	-1
This identifies apps to remove on my FIRE , but does not remove the icon/picture . Maybe they have an updated version , in which case , what will I use to remove this one ? ? ?	-1
really bad development . not worth .99 or being free . wish I could remove from my acct so I do n't have to know I have it	-1
Do n't waste your money ! This app is rediculous ! Even if u do get it free , uninstall imediatly ! What will they come up with next ?	-1
Not worth a buck . Actually it 's just a waste of time . you ca n't really upload songs . once you upload , it asks you how many beats per minute it has ( as if I know that ) & amp ; offers a handy calculator that you tap and it 's supposed to calculate the bpm for you . the counter just stays at zero . also , you have to know the song you 're uploading very well because it does n't actually play it for you so you can tap the & quot ; calculator & quot ; . BUT you can manually add in the beats per minute ( again , good luck guessing ) , however then , when you try to play it , it does n't play and gives you an A . This game sucks . and I wasted even more time writing this review . FAIL .	-1
This app is terrible . Makes me sad that someone both wasted thier time on this and I had to waste even a byte of my data on this worthlessness . This should n't cost any money alone . Personally , I would prefer either Tap Tap Revenge 4 , or hitting myself in the head with a brick instead of playing this . Tl ; dnr ? Sucks . Uninstalled .	-1
Ive downloaded it before and it was bad , I guess the amazon version is no different , I give it one star because they wont let me put no stars .	-1
what makes this game terrible is the fact that it does n't really follow the rhythm of the songs . if you 've played other rhythm games , you know the fun part about them is that you need to react to the song , but you 're better off playing this game on mute if you want to do well	-1
terrible response in the controls , terrible music list , I would n't pay for this app just awful , terrible game . do n't buy	-1
not worth a dollar but good other than thatif it was free it would be great . just so simple . guess im to picky , been playing ddr for years	-1
This game only guesses at the beat when using songs . It does n't analyze the actual song and instead relies on beats per minute for calculating where to put the steps .	-1
Maybe I am asking too much ... But I feel that a game based on rhythmically hitting buttons to a song should have those buttons actually in the rhythm ... No ? Horrible joke of an app .	-1
I 'm really shocked this sucks as bad as is does . It 's not the music selection but the implementation of the app itself.The main point of the game , hit the correct arrows to the beat of the music is seriously flawed . As in there does n't seem to be any discernible beat or pattern to the arrows , Without a rhythm or pattern this is impossible , especially on harder levels.If you like listening to music while tapping randomly on the screen you may like this , of your looking for even a ballpark rendition of Dance Revolution look elsewhere , this ai n't it.Poorly written apps like this give Android such a bad name , how could someone think of charging the same as Angry Birds for this ? I know its free today , but its not even worth that in this state .	-1
How oh how can a game this bad even be picked to be the free app of the day ? Does Amazon even pay attention to the apps that they pick to feature ? I have seen some bad games in my time but this one takes the cake ! It is absolutely horrible in every way . Not even worth free .	-1
Luckily this was the free app of the day . It was interesting for one song . I 'll probably delete it and never play again . Music and moves do n't sync . The UP arrow sort of forces you to block part of the screen . Kept losing my place when switching from UP to any other arrow . Maybe I just suck , but I ca n't help but think that the controls could have been layed out just a little bit better . Did n't have enough interest to even try uploading my own music , but judging by the other reviews , it does n't look like it delivers on the idea it implies.Buy at your own risk .	-1
It will allow other devices to explore the Kindle but wont allow the kindle to explore other devices unless the too are a kindle/Android running this same tool .	-1
cant stop the app from running as a system service . it uses cpu/ram when it shouldnt be . annoying at best . app looks nice , but its destroying my battery . will continue to use tweetdeck as my main twitter app on android and my desktop/laptop . Moto Droid .	-1
The app itself is great . clean looks . well designed ui . customizable options for pix , vids and other external media . changeable color schemes and so on . However , the app has a fatal flaw , imo . This app will remain dormant even if you expressly tell to & quot ; exit application & quot ; . It will stay in the background even after you kill it via Applications settings . That 's just bad news . Now with carriers metering data usage and with battery life getting shorter and shorter I dont want an app hogging both unless i tell it to . If they would fix this flaw , this app is at least 4 stars .	-1
this is a bit advanced for what I need . alot of accounting terms and processes . everything has to be keyed in manually on a tiny , unattractive interface . I wanted to like it , the idea is great , but it 's just a bit much for the average person .	-1
This app was not good . Did n't like the GUI , there are better apps out there . Also this is the third finance FAOTD in like a month . I do n't need 3 finance apps .	-1
I feel really sorry for anyone that might have actually paid for this app . It 's the cheesiest thing ever . It reminds me of Windows 3.0	-1
I honestly only got the app because it 's not every day I can tweet that I 'm downloading money.But the apps permissions are really sketchy .	-1
I was having trouble with one of my other Bible Apps so I am looking for something new . This has great reviews but I do n't share those views . I was given a choice of one translation ( ESV ) even though I chose the button to view other translations there were none . As to ease of use . None there either . I could get a book and chapter but not fine tune it to a verse . Within 5 minutes of this being on my Kindle I deleted it . Maybe this is good for Android only .	-1
sits in memory and has access to who knows what . have to kill app is only way . most other apps do n't have to . could be malware .	-1
Beautiful , Amazing , Smooth , yet frustrating . It has so much potential but it crashes sometime into level 1-2 , tried several times , each time the same . I can only really play level 1-1 and survival . The auto pause is broken pauses frequently and randomly makes gameplay simply not possible . Luckily it can be disabled , but does not fix the main issues .	-1
downloaded with no issues but game will not open on Acer tablet . the app opens only to a black screen .	-1
It only let me listen to samples . I really wanted to enjoy this . Too bad . I wanted to listen to Tarzan .	-1
I 'm not real pleased with this app . It freezes my Kindle up all the time which is very annoying . I would n't purchase it again .	-1
I 'm not trying to be offensives to anyone , ( I have seen Mexicans get stooped by a cop for driving a lawnmower in the street ) . this app is useless . u can read off the list of authors in ten minutes . out of the millions of people who write books , they choose about .0001 % of that . I might be going easy on the app by saying that percentage . its kinda poor . I 'm sorry but JAGAMAGA needs to do a better job at this app and any other app that the may intend to create . if you 've ever heard of audiobooks.com its much better . although you have to pay for the book it is worth the money if you are having trouble reading words. & quot ; the price is rediculous . a $ 10 book cost $ 28 in an audio form . if you do n't have any problem reading I do not reccomend this at all what so ever .	-1
says my voice is stressed when I just say & quot ; hello & quot ; do n't see how this could possible work . wasted my time . uninstall .	-1
Loads and then crashes whenever I try to get the usage hint to go off screen . My rating is based on the crashing .	-1
i tested it ... my words were these ... & quot ; i went to see santa yesterday , he gave me the keys to his sled & quot ; the analysis said.. & quot ; probably truth. & quot ; i inagine it would make for a great parenting tool or party joke.. but it does not obviously produce real results .	-1
Another time waster . I was n't expecting it to work but this literally did n't work . I just had an & # 34 ; empty & # 34 ; app . It was stupid so I deleted it .	-1
I did n't care for this app.I deleted it as soon as I downloaded it.Currently looking for another to take it 's place .	-1
This app is not as unique that I was hoping it would be . It seems more like Valentine 's cards than any other varied ways to express feelings .	-1
It 's good for Valentine 's Day or if you need something for a special occasion , but other than that I have n't really used it .	-1
I like crosswords but this one is BORING . I bought it when it was free and hated it . not worth 1.99 at all .	-1
I 've deleted this crossword game . Too annoying to keep switching back and forth between game and list of clues . The crossword game at pogo.com is much easier to use .	-1
These are British crosswords made for the American market ? Almost . Unfortunately , the British spelling and British idioms and colloquial expressions make these puzzles fine for a Brit but put me at a disadvantage . The partial grid format with missing squares makes it even more difficult to fill in answers . Too many answers are left dangling . Had I realized that these were British , I would not have purchased them . I generally do n't go anywhere near this type of grid format , either . I do n't recommend them to anyone .	-1
Put this on my kindle thinking all crosswords are alike - just some harder than others . WRONG ! Worst crossword puzzles I have ever seen . Ca n't wait to take it off my kindle and find a `` normal '' crossword .	-1
this is a trial 30 app . To bad it stated free in Amazon store . I guess they meant free download . Not worth the time to dl . State 30 DAY TRIAL JUNK	-1
I thought this was going to be a good game but nope . the map rodent ever change so you feel like you are going in circles . you have to stay on the reef too you cant go in the depths and shoot like octopus or something like that . horrible game and waste of money .	-1
I picked this puzzle based on the ratings and higher difficulty level , but the clues were so confusing that I ended up deleting the app . this was a waste of money for me .	-1
It wo n't sync with my online thing and I ca n't even figure out how I 'm supposed to use the coupons with it	-1
Was not what I was looking for so did not get far enough into it to give a fair rating or review .	-1
wo n't sinc as advertised , put too much work into setting it up to find it does n't sinc , which is what i wanted it for !	-1
A massive piece of bloatware from the same company that brought you the coupon-printing ( when it worked ) spyware for Windows . I 'd rather pay full price than put my phone to work for this company 's profit .	-1
I Deleted this app . It was just way to much work . I found a better grocery app that I like much more . that one shows you sales in different stores . this one I just got places to put lists . and then cross them off . I can write them on a piece of paper just as easily : )	-1
I was hoping for something that would have scannable grocery coupons , but this does n't have that function ... so I do n't really get much benefit out of it .	-1
This app is a direct ripoff of the free game Kolf for Linux . Even the courses are the same.The original program is licensed under the Gnu General Public License , which means you CAN take this free program , modify it and sell it , but if you do so , you are REQUIRED to provide the source code . I do n't see any source code for this app.The graphics are terrible , even for a free game , but for a game that costs $ 2.50 , it is unacceptable . The sound is alright , though there are only a hand full of sounds in the entire game . Controls are exactly the same as in Kolf , that is , easy to aim but nearly impossible to control the power . There are typos EVERYWHERE . I 've already paid for this app , then they want me to spend more money to buy courses ( 99 cents each ) which were free under Linux ? That 's zero stars right there.This app looks exactly like someone took a free app from Linux , ported it to Android , slapped a price tag on it , and is trying to make a few quick bucks for his 15 minutes of work .	-1
Horrible gameplay bad controls and grammatical errors make this game kind of a joke . With the competition like it is , you really got ta step it up .	-1
Virus found by ESET Mobile Security , uninstalled . Sorry , but I wo n't tolerate infected apps and spyware variants no matter how the app meets any of my needs . You would think Amazon would scan these apps , but I guess it 's buyer beware here .	-1
dirty cheap ! ... i m glad to get this free apps of the day ... when i select different course and it 's going to charge me for 99 cents ? & quot ; come on ! give me a break ! Angry Birds and Where is my Water is the best of all ! uninstall Mini Golf ! ! ! T mo G2	-1
this morning as I was leaving brunch and I was assaulted by a mob of shoeless beggar leper children wanting my money ! of course I did n't give them a penny , I told them to go get jobs , bastards ! when I got into my Ferrari I noticed my phone was missing , obviously it was stolen by the & quot ; occupy brunch & quot ; beggars . after having my security team break the beggars arms and legs I finally got my phone back , and the dirty leper children downloaded this hideous Golf'Kid app ! I had to replace my entire security team because they smell like beggars now , I will be incinerating my phone after writing this then I have to go to my doctor and get tested for poverty ! all because this app attracted the poor to play golf on my phone !	-1
in 100 hands not even one time were there cards to make a straight flush . That 's about 3000 cards . This game is written very poorly ... BORING . plus the cards are tiny	-1
I wanted to like this . I really did . I do n't play that many solitaire games , but the few that I do play I love . Unfortunately they did n't have any of them . Not one single one.Another thing the UI . It stinks . Navigation is not well thought out . For example , let us say that you are examining the list of games . You come across one that you wish to read the rules about . There is no button or anything telling you the rules . Instead , you have to hit the back button to go back to the main screen , then read the rules there . Why ? Going back to the main screen is ridiculously stupid . It would make much more sense to have a button on the same page where you are examining the list of games , that says `` Rules '' .I have to be honest here.250+ Solitaireis a much better free solitaire app . It allows you to not only get the rules straight away , but also you can view a demo in action of each game . How cool is that ? !	-1
Not crazy about this app . I have played better solitaire games on my phone . I like the solitaire game on my computer a whole lot better .	-1
this was a great free of solitaire until they updated the version . it is everything you could want but with the update the screen is over large on my tablet . I may still use it on my phone but had to find a new one for my tablet . I had to reset my preferences with the update which is very sloppy .	-1
This permission is entirely unnecessary and preventing me from downloading what is still , otherwise , an average app based on others ' reviews . Was going to at least try it , but phone call logs is a definite deal breaker . They have no business knowing anything about who I call and who calls me .	-1
App forces close in the middle of a game . It was my favorite app until four days ago . To slow .	-1
The word hate does not fit , but there are better free solitaire games then this one . No longer have this one . removed	-1
Cards way too small to play this game enjoyably . Do n't need flashy fancy , it 's all about the cards and they need to be big enough to see without a magnifying glass .	-1
Although this was easy to install and a great concept , it just does n't work . I have tried to use it countless times and after perusing the vast laibrary , selecting a book and clicking on it , I have yet to get anything other than , & # 34 ; Whoops , try again later. & # 34 ; I think if I could actually use it I would like it , however , all I can do is uninstall . Maybe it is compatable with Acer , maybe it is n't , but I will never know . A bust in my book , ( or tablet as the case may be )	-1
sure each page offers a couple sentences about an underlined food but there are no pictures , tips , or preperation/uses for them . what you do get , however , is a different advert , a different background color and that image of grapes up there on the Icon on each page .	-1
There is a brief banner , then a blank , black screen . Does n't Work on Droid X . Will uninstall . Very disappointed . Ca n't back out , have to hit the home button , at least it did n't lock up my phone .	-1
Wo n't install on my tablet because it does n't have a camera ? That 's just a minor feature of this app , is n't it . Ca n't they just make the other features work on tablets ?	-1
You really ca n't set or even lock the brush size and color ? Would rate as 3 with color/brush settings and 4 with a fill tool .	-1
Awful , contacted customer service over 2 weeks ago and still no response . Will not work on my kindle Fire.Gave 1 starbecause I had to .	-1
havent been able to figure it out to deal with it . I some how managed to get some music in a folder and some kid apps but I couldnt tell you how I did it .	-1
Descent file manager wish it went more in depth ! Don 't know what else to say other than it does what it says .	-1
I am a Londoner living in USA for 30 years , nothing new , do n't waste your time , at least it was free ! Wanted something much more hip and up to date . Slang in the UK has changed , not reflected here .	-1
It 's not what I thought it would be . Too limited and you ca n't due a word search . Better to look up in internet .	-1
Most of the words are either sex drug or alcohol relatedSure that the British talk about more than that . Could have been interesting but is n't .	-1
Inappropriate for anyone . Using these words are just saying inappropriate words in & quot ; code & quot ; . It often repeats itself , and gets old very fast . I would not recommend this app .	-1
I thought this might be funny , but it was totally lame and not at all funny or educational in learning new words .	-1
There are so many slang words that are so cute , so why did the devs use sexual and drug based ones ? An lot of these definitions are not only dead wrong , but they have n't been used since my gaffer was a lad .	-1
I ca n't even answer the flipping question ! All I can do is press show answer do n't get this on the kindle fire and it wo n't let you make new cards on this ! I do n't see how anyone likes this ... if no stars was an option I would put that !	-1
I am a fan of Anki on other machines , but I could not get anything to work here on the Kindle Fire HD .	-1
Product has a lot of information , appears in random order . I did not find a way to id information that I wanted to review , however , I am not an expert ; perhaps others have found a way .	-1
Not what I was looking for and seems clunky . Have n't found a good time zone converter for the Kindle Fire yet .	-1
Having my significant other living across the globe , I was looking for a Kindle app that could convert the two different time zones . All in all , it did that and it was fine . It was fairly easy to understand which is why I would have given this three stars instead of two . The only reason I did give two stars is that the menu to scroll through the different time zones was VERY sensitive , so it was extremely easy to want to scroll a tiny bit down the list when the menu thinks you want to scroll all the way to the end . It was very frustrating , which is unfortunate because the app was okay otherwise .	-1
Lots wrong with this app . Cities are random and hard to find . Some are listed under continent , some under country . Some major cities are completely missing . There is no way to add a city or to search the city list there . Definitely a waste .	-1
worst thing ever the jokes suck and do n't make any sense ! hate it do n't get ! EVER ! I mean it dont	-1
this app sucks . the jokes are stupid . a lot of people think the same thing . if you are reading this I hope you know by now NOT to get this.its pointless .	-1
WAN NA HEAR A JOKE ? ... . OKTHIS APP IS THE REAL JOKEthe worst ever . how do cats eat spaghetti . put in their mouths . that 's not a joke . That 's just sad . if u want a JOKE APP well get a different one if u want a JOKE OF AN APP ... .. GET THIS ONE . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . ... . . .	-1
jokes are stupid BELIVE ME DONT GET IT jokes like ... there is a new barbie a Frankenstein barbie comes with bolts I neck . how is that funny there is 2many dumb ones like apple jokes cat jokes even ardvark jokes . I was exited when it said bar jokes but then I got a hot dog walks into a bar and the bar tender says sorry we do n't serve food . please do n't get it I beg you not to get it . does n't deserve a star . booooooooooooooooooooooooo	-1
it wuz terrible . i couldnt even get it 2 open . people who invented this , if u r reading this , please make something that tells jokes and works ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
Okay , I did n't even download this app because of the pictures . The one about the dad having to stand up , I did n't find funny at all . And , I do n't know if it 's just me , but did n't they spell mammal wrong ? ? ? P.S . Do n't get this app	-1
Downloaded , hoping to find a station that was broadcasting a baseball game , but the station choices are EXTREMELY limited . Could n't find what I was looking for and the interface was very simplistic and no option to search . I gave it one star because leaving the rating blank was not an option . : (	-1
Too many other apps available to get radio for free that have more selection . Just too limited , but it does work .	-1

I deleted this product within fifteen minutes of loading it . It is not at all intuitive and at times very hard to use . Searches were slow and at times did not work . Try Med-scape . Much better product much easier to use .	-1
I downloaded MOG because I have had the service for 2 years on my Iphone . Now I buy a Kindle Fire so I can get MOG on Android thru Amazon , but ca n't find it to install . So I own the Mog app , pay $ 10/mo . For MOG service , and CAN NOT EVEN USE IT ! ! ! This app is useless on my Kindle Fire . Can anyone help me tweak this app to work on kindle fire ? ? ? HELP ! ! Do n't know if I should cancel MOG OR RETURN MY KNDLE FIRE ! ! ? ? ? ? P.S . I LOVE MOG MUSIC APP ON IPHONE ! ! ! BEST MUSIC APP EVER ! ! !	-1
Awful logo ! I wish I had waited a bit more because now I do n't know how to delete it . HELP !	-1
I downloaded this app and did not like it , so I thought I removed it completely from my account , but I guess it is still in the Cloud . I do not consider this app to be very motivational at all . Would really prefer it to be totally removed from customer buying options/selections altogether ! !	-1
This app does not work . I downloaded but was never ever able to open it . Use the Shopkick app through Google . It works great .	-1
Downloaded this app for my Archos 43 . Tried it for a day and every time I tried to run it got an `` oops '' error , try again later . Uninstalled . Nice waste of time , and the company has n't bothered to reply to my inquiry	-1
Attention Developer : I would gladly PAY for this app if you would:1 ) Include more than fifty herbs . Alright , that 's exaggerated , but many , many common herbs are missing.2 ) Cross-reference these to ailments as the user below suggests . It 's an app - it should do something more than a booklet ; 3 ) Include the magickal correspondences.As it is , there was n't enough information to really warrant it - I just went ahead and bought a book on herbs , which I can read on the Kyros . Which yes , this at least does work on .	-1
Device : Kindle FireI love the app Evernote itself . It is one of the easiest amd best taking note apps you can get . Except for one thing- I discovered this app has viruses . When I ran a full scan of & quot ; Dr . Web Anti-Virus Lite & quot ; , it showed that Evernote had a virus	-1
I always read reviews before I use an app . But I usually go to & quot ; See All Customer Reviews & quot ; then choose & quot ; Newest First & quot ; because those reviews usually give you the most accurate idea of how the app works now.This app seemed to be highly lauded . It 's supposed to have an & quot ; easy & quot ; user interface . I 'm a homeschooling mother of an autistic son with a kindergartener in school . I am converting our lives from & quot ; traditional & quot ; to what can best be described as all natural . I also suffer from a joint disorder so there are lots of doctor 's appointment to keep up with for my son and I . Right now I have a gigantic wicker basket full of binders and folders to try to keep my household managed . I wanted something easy that I could use that would keep track of EVERYTHING , that would allow me to take photo memos and voice memos . This seemed perfect.However , the interface is NOT user friendly . It wo n't let me delete notebooks . I have four emails in my inbox asking me to connect to my computer so it can & quot ; sync & quot ; which I 'm wary of . You can upgrade but it 's not a & quot ; for life & quot ; type of upgrade that will sit in your Amazon Cloud Drive until you die ... it 's a subscription.I think that it should 've been made clear that this app was really geared more toward a business person who can write off a monthly subscription . I have a tight budget . I do n't mind paying $ 4 , $ 5 , even $ 10 for an app that would give me the functionality that I need but not a monthly subscription.This just is n't a good app even though it has all the features I need because it 's really just a trial before you get the subscription . I 'm hoping I can get my stuff off here before I delete it . If you can afford the monthly subscription , I 'm sure it 's awesome .	-1
Great app for organizing and keeping track of things as they happen , however the terms clearly states they can use , modify and distribute anything you upload for purposes of the site and sell to partners . Again , GREAT app ... not worth it to me .	-1
I was so overwhelmed with what this app could do that I jumped right at it , created lots of notebooks and notes . It does the job pretty well so why did I get bored ? ? This app just lacked color . IT LACKED LIFE . It was n't visually entertaining . Everything looks dull with the black font . A highlighter could have been useful . Make it stand out more . I found that while I was reading with it , it got pretty boring and dull . Even though I got my notes organized , they all look muddled together . All look the same . Not that exciting anymore . A little color wo n't hurt anybody . Just saying .	-1
I ca n't find the application on my Kindle and I do n't know how to get help . Can you help me ?	-1
for me it did not work on kindle fire hd because it required a phone number might be great for a smart phone	-1
I ca n't figure out what amazing things this is supposed to do -- take notes ? I also tried to save a webpage using it. , b ut it only saved the URL . And I ca n't access it without wifi access or paying apremium price.I also ca n't get rid of the `` shortcut '' for it on my Kindle Fire after uninstalling the program .	-1
The permissions for this app were too much for me . I love the concept and interface of Evernote , but I will be finding something less intrusive !	-1
Had to uninstall . I 'm sure if they put their minds to it they could provide greater privacy . But as much as they intend to be in touch with their user base if they made a more private version it would only serve to highlight how bad this version is.It 's the Facebook philosophy , take much more than you think you can get away with , and then pull back a little to appease a few people , when enough people complain . Divide and conquer .	-1
Need I say more ? No I do n't think so but I will . why the hell does a note taking app meed every permission my phone have to offer ? it does n't . try again guys .	-1
This app has a set of very bad ( invasive ) permissions and the service in general has a disregard for privacy . On the one hand , they advertise Evernote as a way to & # 34 ; Remember everything. & # 34 ; And the question has been asked repeatedly : & # 34 ; Everything ? Really ? & # 34 ; Look through the user forums and you will see that whenever that question is asked , a very vocal group of & # 34 ; evangelists & # 34 ; rise up and bat down privacy concerns as & # 34 ; paranoid & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; unfounded & # 34 ; . Often , after that a few of them begin moaning about how badly the & # 34 ; evangelists & # 34 ; are treated.If you were to store sensitive information in Evernote ( such as credit card receipts , tax returns , medical data including prescription medications , et cetera ) , you might as well just scan it and post the data on the internet for all to see.Further , by installing this app , you give Evernote permission to access your contacts ( why would they need that ? ) , to access and modify any of your data , and generally carte blanche access to your phone or tablet . There is no earthly reason that they need that level of access.Evernote management has dismissed any privacy concerns , stating that they are not a priority , and their rabid userbase can and will attack you for daring to question this choice . The company is more interested in serving ads than serving their users . I even saw a post on their forum once from an & # 34 ; experienced & # 34 ; user who asked & # 34 ; Where did the ads go in the latest version ? I miss them. & # 34 ; I have never seen such a bizarre statement . It 's like Stockholm Syndrome.I highly recommend avoiding this app like the plague .	-1
UPDATE : In addition , after I deleted the app from my device and left it in the cloud , it left behind a hidden folder on my SD card . I had to manually remove it with a third party application . Honestly , this is worth a star demerit but I do n't hate Evernote.Pros : I enjoyed typing my notes directly into the Kindle Fire ( KF ) app , like using a simple word processor . I like that Evernote synched my KF to an insecure web server , to my desktop , and to a web interface . It was an easy way to transfer image and text files.Cons : It was hard to cut and paste text on the Kindle Fire ( KF ) . What I did instead was create multiple notes that I was going to patch together later on a desktop . That is , until I lost one my biggest notes . Now my heart is crying . I 'm not sure how much of the sync error is due to Evernote or Kindle Fire 's memory , but regardless , the two apps combined makes me wince.Verdict : I just deleted the app.If you 're going to use Evernote : Make sure to have a back up version in another app !	-1
way to many permissions and invading your privacy and it should not be able to read the data in your phone	-1
Never worked for me . Would not let me sign in or do anything . not sure what it is for or supposed to be used for .	-1
Too hard to figure out .	-1
If you expect to write a quick note on your Kindle Fire and view it later , you may be surprised when you ca n't view it unless you 're online . I was . If you try to view your note while offline all you get is a screen suggesting an upgrade to the full version . Evernote allows you to synch your notes across many devices , which is good if that 's what you 're looking for . If you just want to keep some reminders on your Kindle then it 's quite disappointing . Fortunately there are other apps that are very happy to record your notes and let you view them , all right there on the Kindle . No need to turn on wireless just to view a note .	-1
I loved this app because it kept my notes updated everywhere ... my kindle fire , Pc , and my cellphone . but recently it kept deleting all my notes ! I had to continuosly recreate all I could remember until I just gave up and uninstalled it , happened about 5 times .	-1
It 's an ok app . I do n't like using it so I deleted it from my ereader . It 's not what I wanted .	-1
Too cumberson ; too many choices . Have tried it twice and deleted it both times . I just want to write myself a note . I do n't need notebooks and categories , etc . I do n't care about sharing my notes between devices . I 'd like something that works like a small pad of paper . Take a note , accomplish the task noted , then toss the note . Do n't need all the high tech `` stuff '' .	-1
I thought that this app really sucked . It seems that the free version is extremely downgraded from the regular version . It was weird to operate it and not at all helpful , so I deleted it .	-1
I will remove today..I 've had the free version on my Kindle for about a year now . It worked fine but now I have been receiving an update alert almost daily for about a month now . I will try the Spring Pad someone else suggested . The permissions are also a concern now..YES , I AM ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO DOES GLOSS OVER THE FINE PRINT..but I will make a new effort to be more careful..had no idea they were so sneaky .	-1
I feel that this sudoku is very hard to play as the hint numbers are hard to enter as they constantly are changing when you put operators in other cells .	-1
I did n't like this one , mainly because I could n't choose the options I would have liked . Seemed either too hard or I just did n't figure it out .	-1
Unfortunately this never downloaded on my Android phone . I wish it would have . I did pay for it I 'm sorry to say .	-1
I 'll admit that I 've followed my horoscope for quite awhile now for entertainment . Though I do n't believe in it in any serious way , I always find it interesting to see if anything in my day matches up ( spoiler alert : not often ) . The nice thing about this app is it has both a horoscope and a quick tarot card section as well . Both seem to do what they are supposed to , but the app on Kindle Fire is really bad looking . It 's obviously been sized for mobile phones so it does n't fill the screen properly . Also , the horoscope text is white and the background is very light , making it difficult to read the first couple sentences . If the interface was updated for KF I would raise my rating . It 's really a 3 and a half . It 's free , so I really should n't be complaining , but that 's my review . ; )	-1
This is probably an OK app , if it is what you need and you knew how to use it . There are no clear instructions . I played with it for a while . It seemed OK , but I could n't really get anywhere with it . ALSO , I really did not like the idea of it including the Flurry Analytics in the program . I have heard bad things about this . I tried to use the `` opt out '' option , but it would n't let me . I guess this app really just was n't for me ... I deleted this app .	-1
I cant figure anything out the Colorado are hard to find and when I try to draw it wont let me	-1
The app works pretty well , but was not as easy to use as advertised . If you have a lot of patience to learn it I can see this app being very good , but I like apps that are easier to use and simple to learn , so this is not for me .	-1
This app would be awesome if it worked . I get force close when adding a photo to the background . My devices are HTC Desire ( Froyo ) and HTC Sensation 4G ( Gingerbread ) . Please update ... .	-1
This is probably a good app if one knows how to use it , I could not find clear instructions so I played with it a bit and just kept going around in circles . Ended up deleting it since I could not get anywhere with it . You may think it is obvious how to use , but I have learned that you never assume others are on the same page as you . Better to bore them with detailed instructions than to assume they know how to use . Maybe the paid version is better , I do n't know .	-1
I really wanted this app but was very disappointed when I found out I ca n't even use it . Everytime I try to open the app it shuts down . What a waste of $ 2 ... : /	-1
I can only find thumbnails of my drawings with horrible resolution after spending a long time sketching . Really disappointed.This app never worked on my kindle fire .	-1
This app dose not let do anything with my web sites.all it does is track exporting things and domains you are auctioning off not worth it better off during silk to go to the real website .	-1
This does not work . Few work at all . Free is not cheap enough for something that does not work . Do n't buy .	-1
These have it really worked for me . I 'm Hopi g these apps will improve . This is the end of review .	-1
Takes FOREVER for it to scan with a 4g connection . Seems like it tries to focus constantly while other barcode scanners scan instantly	-1
Recent updates to Android clock/etc make this application irrelevant , as of Android 4.2.x onward . Not much else to say here .	-1
greetings fellow amazonians this morning I had trouble sleeping so I downloaded the polyclock app because I have so many friends in other time zones and I want to make sure that I am calling them at the right time . well unfortunately I left the app on west coast time when I fell asleep and when I awoke did n't realize that I was three hours late for work . boy was maury ( of maury 's cheese factory fame ) pissed . he would have fired me on the spot , but my boss tyrone is still in the hospital from my flinging accident . thanks amazon for almost costing me my job .	-1
The first day I got it it had to be forced closed I have n't used it yet so I do n't know .	-1
Look , yesterdays faotd was okay , but not great . now your giving us a clock when we already have one on our phones and kindle fires . I know you can do better . why not do angry birds space or some thing that would have a whole lot of good reviews . Not a clock , not a painting app , and not any thing that kids and adults think deserve a one star . some good apps to put up for faotd is bird jerk , angry birds space , cataline , and any other good game . Another thing , I do n't really do n't care about knowing the time in other country 's . so its just plain use less for me .	-1
P0ppyC0ck ! What 's with all the INTRUSIVE PERMISSIONS ? I 'm not sure if this app will help you keep track of time , but it will certainly l help THEM keep track of YOU.No thanks.~Uninstalling	-1
do n't . mean to make anyone . mad but I agree with gamer I am sure I said the same thing last week about the crapy apps come on amazon not like its really free ! we have to pay to get free apps ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
OK , so someone already asked about network sockets permissions , and then updated review saying that the developer contracted him and explained and it is reasonable . He did n't say what the dev said so his review is useless . So , why the app needs socket permissions ? Also , this is more important to me , why does the app need fine grained location ? For things like time zone one would think that even coarse location is way too detailed .	-1
this free app is great . I have this new uninstaller I wanted to test and this is a great place to start .	-1
Kinda boring game with graphics that were *yawn* rather basic . I expected more for a game that retails for 2.99. free would be OK but not 2.99	-1
It 's another matching game but not the same that you normally see with the likes of Bejewelled . That would n't annoy me , but the graphics are the pits on my EVO 3D and my Galaxy Tab . Both . I would n't recommend , especially for three bucks !	-1
does n't work on my droid Inc.. uninstalled and reinstalled still no go.. like the concept ... fix the bug so it works and I would reload it ...	-1
the game seems to work but because u have to move ur finger in different directions u run out of time and cant get the extra time . the icons are too small and need to be made bigger since ur only using less than half of the screen .	-1
I like the diagonal connection ability , but that is about all I like about this game . The graphics are lame , and the sound is annoying . The gameplay area does not make good use of the screen so there is a lot of dead space . This game needs some major polish.Playing is tedious rather than fun.And yeah , not all the items are candy . Should be called SweetSwipe instead - get some alliteration there.This game is possibly worth 99 cents for the rare person who seems to enjoy this game , but certainly not worth $ 2.99 at this stage of development . For me , this game is n't worth keeping even for free .	-1
The developer reviewed his or her own game . For shame ! Go ahead , read the review from August and tell me it 's not fake.As for the game , I got it for free but I certainly would n't pay anything . In fact , I feel that Amazon and the publisher owe ME money now for having stolen 5 minutes of my life .	-1
Not the best game , not the worst . Did n't freeze up and ran smoothly . Okay time waster but only if there is nothing else on your phone to play with . Might be more fun for 8 year old girls . Most people will fun this mighty lame.The good news for FAOTD reviewers is the permissions will be within the acceptable range preventing the standard dialogues . I guess it 's worth 2 stars - 1 for 8 year old girls ( they need games too ) and the other for preventing the permission war .	-1
The only thing this game has going for it is it 's incredibly boring . Not the greatest thing to boast about , but there it is .	-1
I got this as the free app of the day , so I 'm more than glad to do an honest review . It installed fine on my EVO 3D and it plays ok . The biggest problem right off the bat is that it does n't fit my screen fully . Ok , not exactly a deal breaker in this situation , but had I purchased it for $ 3 it would be . I see people complaining about not swiping patterns correctly . I would disagree . It 's was very responsive . The music , eh . It could be better . My biggest complaint is that it 's way too easy for me or probably any adult . Seriously , you can score points by connecting 2 pieces in a row . How hard is that ? They 're all over the game board . But I can see how kids might love this.Final thought . This is not for me . I 've already uninstalled it . It 's not the worst game I 've tried , but far from great or worth the money . That 's why I give it 2 stars . Had I paid $ 3 for it , I 'd be really pissed . Those who let their kids play on their handheld devices might find value in this .	-1
This game was fun ... for about 60 seconds . Then you realize what you see is what you get ... Let down .	-1
Sadly the game kept freezing on my Samsung and even with my stylus I could n't move anything . I turned my phone off and on and retried it a few times before uninstalling it.I love candy sooo it hurt me to remove it from my phone .	-1
to simple , not really challenging or fun . Candy like jewels but without the harder levels . Only lasted part of a day , deleted . another trial but I 'd recommend skipping unless you are bored and have twenty minutes to waste .	-1
The sounds really are n't that fun and the game is way too simple if you want a challenge , do n't get this	-1
Wish it was more like bejeweled/ candy crush but still pretty fun . Since its free its a why-not but not high on my list	-1
This is another one I just did not understand , therefore , I lost interest in the game . It just did n't hold my interest	-1
This game is not entertaining at all ... very boring . I really thought it was more like a match three game , but it is not . I do n't particularly like this game , so I ca n't recommend it to anyone .	-1
I thought this game looked fun , and it was . However , once you play it a couple of times , it will not let you play anymore . It should be marked as a DEMO . So if you just want a demo , it is worth the download , otherwise do n't take up space with this one . thank you .	-1
Did download and removed from kindle , not what I thought it was going to be . Hate the advertisement that comes with the free apps .	-1
Tried this as I like match three games . It did not perform well on my Kindle Fire HD . Then , after closing the app , it would not load to full screen again ! Not worth it , even if THO it 's free , not worth while . I deleted it ASAP !	-1
After playing Candy Deluxe ( not Candy Crush mind you ) , this game came up really short . Visuals boring and so was game .	-1
I did not enjoy this game and I believe I got rid of it . The sound attached to is is extremely annoying , yet without sound it does n't work either . It feels almost childish .	-1
I deleted this game . It is similar to Bejeweled Blitz but not quite as good . I thought it would be close to Candy Crush but not even close . Since I have downloaded Candy Crush to my Kindle , I know longer play this game . I actually found this game quite boring .	-1
Its okay but there 's no challenge in playing this game maybe for children ages 1-3 it could be fun for them to play .	-1
I played this a few times , but it was n't what I wanted in a game , so I did n't keep it .	-1
this swap game was not a good one for me . just not what i expected was not up to jewel	-1
I no this is not fare but I was looking for candy crush and this is not it . I so deleted it once it was n't at all even close .	-1
weelll I liked this game . it 's fast paced and addictive . wish it would have mire levels though . all in all for a free app , it does the quick break job	-1
This game is not really challenging , just a time waster ... and if I use it ( I have only used it about 4 times ) I stop playing within 3 minutes because then I remember how non interesting it is . Not a good game ... Candy Crush is 1000 times better .	-1
As in the other swipe game I reviewed , it is difficult to swipe and create alike pieces . This also needs to be reviewed for Kindle use .	-1
this is another dispointing game . needs more lacking in alot . Would only play it if there was nothing else to do would not recommend this to anyone .	-1
I just was not happy with this app , it just did n't work very well on my Kindle . Candy Crush is my choice wish the Kindle had it .	-1
Some people that I know really like it , but I did n't find it that great . I took it off of my tablet . There are other three or four-in-a-row that are better I thought .	-1
I do not like this game . It is not what I expected . I do not like playing this game at all .	-1
I do n't like the game . It is not what I expected it to be . It may be fine for others , but not for me .	-1
I wanted to play it really bad , but it did n't work on my kindle , so I had to delete it .	-1
When I tried to play it I kept getting an 'error ' message asking me to re-purchase . Have n't gotten around to doing this yet .	-1
but it wasnt worth keeping . There are many others out ther like this that are much better . so those were the ones I kept .	-1
probably a good game for younger kids , but the graphics and playing area could be enhanced to create a more challenging game .	-1
I put in the wrong word , I was actually trying to get candy crush and not candy swipe . Did n't even use it .	-1
This was a fun game for my 4 year old grandkids ; however at times the game would just shut down or the screen would become small . Lost interest in this after a few times of that happening .	-1
This is NOT the game.Do n't download this expecting the game.I immediately took it off my device after realizing this . Poor misrepresentation .	-1
This download was n't anything too special at all and thats why i rated it a 1 star . It did n't freeze or anything just did n't have but more than a week as other downloads were better out there .	-1
This game is pretty lame . Easy to play , but it does n't hold my attention . I much prefer playing Bejeweled . At least it 's free .	-1
I do not see why all the people like this . i did not like it at all . deleted it . .	-1
You can pretty much knock out similar pairs anyway you strike it and requires no thought at all ... lame at best !	-1
I liked the game until it kept shutting down and it would take me to turn off my kindle , start it up again and sometimes it would stillbe there stuck so you ca n't go on to play again .	-1
My DROIDX has a lockout feature , just like any mobile phone has since I can remember.People need to RTM , seriously ... or get duped into blowing two coffees ' worth of cash on a redundant feature built into their phone .	-1
this would be a great program and has worked great in the past , but the developer has not updated it in a very long while here on amazon	-1
I have galaxy s3 . this app does n't work . launched it , set it up relaunched restarted but still does n't work . all my blocked apps open up without any resistance .	-1
Ca n't lock settings . Can be uninstalled without a & quot ; pattern & quot ; . Anyone that knows how to uninstall an app can bypass this and have access to everything . Pattern lock your device using the standard Android security if you care . While a good idea , this is all show with no real & quot ; security & quot ; .	-1
Root method causes all kinds of issues after sending the first gmail . Other mode has issues with adding widgets ( in go launcher ) . If it works is great , but it does n't . Also does n't allow to skip the backup question .	-1
No ICS support and easily bypassed . Virtually worthless as a free app . Pay for it ? No way ! DO NOT BUY !	-1
I installed this but never set it up.Had lots of trouble with my cell phone ( Samsung Droid Charge ) running hot while in my pocket and supposedly not doing anything . Discovered this app was always running , even though I had never started it running on my phone . I lost a lot of battery life.Also had a major problem with seeing the apps on the SD card . After closing an app , I would go back to my main menu page not see anything that was on the SD card . Also had trouble with phone not recognizing that I was trying to charge it from the usb port on my labtop , an external battery and a couple of times even from the 110 outlet ; it kept wanting to transfer data . It did go ahead and charge also , but disconnected , I could no longer see my apps on the SD card ( again ! ) . Enough ! ! ! To be fair , I am running an app called Folder Editor . There may be a conflict with it and SEAL.Uninstalled this app and rebooted the phone , all problems appear to be solved !	-1
I 'm running on a Atrix and i found this app causes a force close when sending email via gmail app . Also biometric finger print unlocking became unstable , sometimes it would respond , most times it would not . Seem like a good program if the bugs are worked out but as is right now , I will keep it off my phone .	-1
This app was a savior for me when letting my kids use my phone . It would force a passcode or pattern to use apps I wanted to lock . Was very dependable . Then an update came for my phone . Now , while the app loads up and lets you choose what to protect , it wo n't protect ANYTHING . I 've deleted , redownloaded , fiddled with the options and to no avail , this app refuses to block anything anymore . Tried using the contact help in the app , but there has n't been a response in over a MONTH . Might work for your phone , but do n't expect it to work forever . Unless there is any kind of update , avoid .	-1
Random unsubstantiated facts that are not really what I was looking for . I was hoping for specific health tips on maintaining a healthy lifestyle such as exercise and diet ideas . Not stuff like `` Raw milk is from cows , sheep , or goats '' .	-1
Id rather use a labtop than a kindle because there 's some things that kindles cant do , like e.g . couponing . Regular labtops display coupons a lot better .	-1
Installed this app based on high reviews . Just got a screen that says I should upgrade to the VIP version . Can not get basic app to run . uninstalled , droid incredible	-1
This app is one of the worst out there ... ... i originally had it for my kindle ... ..and it worked for like 6 months ... ..then it told me i needed an upgrade which was free ... everytime i tried to upgrade it would not go through ... .i then got the app for my phone ... ... through google play ... same problem ... ... im tired of people making half ass free apps and then just allowing the consumers like me to struggle just to use it ... ..so word of mouth ... ..dont use this app ... ..it doesnt load the coupons on my kindle fire or my smartphone ... ... .	-1
This app is not for me . Its too high tech for my use . I 'll wait for my grandchildren to setup for me .	-1
Subscribed to this and loved it , however if you change phones , the subscription will not transfer to new phone . Company ignored emails and kept charging my credit card . Finally had to cancel credit card to get charges to stop . It 's a great app , but that experience really ticked me off and wo n't use it .	-1
I got this without listening to reviews and now feel sorry I did . The game did n't even let me register , just kept telling me make a new account or pick a password after I had just put one in . I never got to try it out on kindle fire . Do n't buy it	-1
Sservers are almost slways full and game play is boring . Must have net to play , no offline or single player modes .	-1
sweet lil game , but ... it is so hard on certain levels that even the built-in hint systems doesnt know how to beat it ...	-1
It looks like the new update 1.0.9 does not work on the Kindle Fire , it gets to the load screen and stops about half way down the page . Hopefully they will fix this soon . I 'll update my review once i can actually play the game .	-1
I understand that with free aps your going to get ads . What i hate is when those ads are full length full size commercials that suddenly pop up and take over your whole screen.I have a 3g tablet so those videos do nothing but eat up my data plan .	-1
The entire family was annoyed with this game . To clear the bubbles you have to tap the bubble cluster TWICE ! What the heck is up with that ? We deleted it and got & # 34 ; Aces Bubble Popper , & # 34 ; which is awesome .	-1
I hate to say this , but it 's just an ok program ( there are better free ones available ) , but it gagged on my Optimus , froze the phone .	-1
This program has a major flaw . It autostarts itself and has no way other then a taskkiller to stop it . So it destroys your battery . Can not even recommend for free let alone $ 4 .	-1
one thing that that will kill your phone 's battery quick is having the GPS on all the time . when you close this app , it stays active on the app bar including the GPS ! The developers need to add an option to kill the app on exit . I had to go to the settings on the phone and manual kill the app to shut down the GPS . I 'm not installing yet , but this is a major flaw !	-1
No way to change the orientation to portrait , and no way to exit the application . Even if I kill the app it just comes right back . It chews up battery life like nobodies business and no way to exit it - your only option is to `` pause '' it .	-1
I would use this app often if it worked in portrait view.the fact that it is limited to landscape view only makes it utterly worthless to me because I do n't want to rearrange my very hi-tech dashboard array to accomodate it.1 star because of this glaring and thoughtless fault .	-1
The interface and visuals are great , but the functionality leaves a lot to be desired . Even when locked on to 6+ gps satellites and within 10m accuracy , the speed jumps erratically , often blinking out and showing a speed of 0 mph , then jumping to double what it should be before moving to the accurate speed while I was driving at a constant speed . After some of those bugs are tackled , I 'll try again , but as it is , there is still a bit of work to do .	-1
Do not waste your money on this game . the control is way to fast ... well actually everting is . Go get Angry Birds instead of this .	-1
the Internet version is great . this one sucks . I wasted my time and money for this . do n't . waste your time .	-1
I wonder if there is wifi in heaven ? ? because my app wo n't work without it . please fix that for us .	-1
What I did n't like about this app was that if you were not connected to the internet you could n't use most of the functions ( jump from one book or passage to another , highlight text , etc ) . Stopped using it and am using another now .	-1
well its the holy Bible should n't it be.free to everyone to use without having to have ur.info. ? ? ? ? ? I mean really ! I just recently read.this review and it was talking about how it constantly . running and how even when u go to settings.or whateverr and think u shut it off wait a while and without turning . it on look and c if it is still running and then boom it will b ! ! ! ! I tried and I believe this guy 10000000000000000 percent ! ! ! ! DO NOT GET THIS APP ! ! IF U WANT TO READ HE HOLY BIBLE GO GET ONE AT HASTINGS & reg ; OR SOMETHING PLUS THEY MAKE ONES.THAT R WAY SMALLER THAN A KINDLE	-1
nice ap but of little use unless you are connected to wi fi . ca n't save anything to your kindle so must have access to use it . seems a bit useless in that regard	-1
download another bible version ! can not move to verse you want to read . not worthit . i did finallly get a etter versin and now enjoy the convience of my kindlefire with my bible	-1
the bible is the word of god . and if you want to or love god read it . this is an unecesarry app . it turns the word of god into a toy . you need requirements like email or facebook and you need wi fi to even read ! if you really want to read it . go to the bookstore and download a free bible there . eay better and will.draw you closer to the lord	-1
The speaker is reading from a real KJV of the Bible.. this written version is not correct when you read it there are a few one word changes that do n't & quot ; seem & quot ; to matter much but when a Major word ( grain for meat ) is changed in a whole chapter well now you ( youversion ) have changed GODS WORD and that is not right . That 's so sad on your part youversion you had a great Bible here but not antlymore . Changing the LORDS name to look so small is even worse . May GOD give you what you need ... ..	-1
The automatic cue to the aJV is descriminatory to the other versions avaikable/ It would be better if a choice of versions was allowed at the time of choosing the app .	-1
This is a terrific app for on the go Bible study . It helps when you are in a place where you ca n't open your regular print Bible . Great resources for study too .	-1
I gave this app 5 stars in the Aneroid Marker , but the Amazon version is not compatible with the Kindle Fire .	-1
this should n't be an app if u have to make it free for people to get it why should they get it its just a book a greedy king twisted to make his people scared	-1
I 'm not sure if I should read this book to my child . It 's in places violent , others sexual . And why did Jesus kill a fig tree ? Buddha would never do that .	-1
I 'm sorry but htis is a weak version of the Bible . I did n't like it mainly because it was very limited . I suggest Olivetree instead .	-1
I ca n't even make a profile like I 'm not going to be able to have fun with the darn app so how about I uninstall this useless freaken app !	-1
my physical copy of The Bible does n't need to know about my accounts , my phone , or my networks . why does this app need to know ? until this app gets rid of all these unnecessary permissions , i will not be getting it.to all of you who already have this app , i highly suggest that you get rid of it and find a Bible app that is n't out to mine data . there are plenty others out there .	-1
It works fine as a Bible . It allows you to jump to the passage you want to read . HOWEVER , the app is always running , and periodically pops up reminders to read every day . I tried to shut them off in the settings , but they come up anyway . I will be uninstalling .	-1
Just looking at it is wow the interface looks bad if you are looking for a Bible app get olivetree !	-1
the bible never showed up on tablet . im just glad it was not expensive . I hate technology . thanks for nothing	-1
I was hoping it was a downloadable Bible for my phone . The verbal play feature is greatly used but very slow in loading . I do n't like the fact that it 's using my data usage . Reading it is fine ; the text is clear and adjustable in size and background color . The reading plans are a great idea ! Thanks for those .	-1
not at all good . this program was not well thought out . It lacks a great deal very challenging to use	-1
i never got the free amazon coins after i downloaded and opened the app found a lot of them was like this a rip off	-1
You need to have an internet connection to use it . For WiFi Kindle users , this is not practical for a Bible & # 34 ; reader. & # 34 ; Get one of the other apps ( like the KJV Bible ) or download the free ebook ( ESV Bible ) . Then , you can read in the park or on the go ...	-1
Unable to get offline to work initiate , unable to get it to workeven though I 've contacted Support . I 'm very frustrated..	-1
Full of porn and violence . Do n't let your kids read this one , folks . They might end up deranged and delusional .	-1
I had gotten this app months ago and really loved it . I like reading the verse of the day and then finding it in the bible and book marking it for a later date . I recently opened my bible app and it looks different and responds differently than I what I use to do with it . I can not bookmark a verse now without first logging into it . I do n't want to log into something to save a verse - it is another password I have to remember and another thing I have to belong to or sign up for to use . I just want to use the app and be able to refer to it at times that I may need it most . I would bookmark the verses so they would be saved for a later date to write in a card or note to a friend or my children . I am disappointed you changed the app . On a positive side the bible section is very user friendly .	-1
Read the Bible now and fell better about your sins go out on Saturday get drunk and then go to pled your sins on Sunday what a joke you can do whatever you what besides kill yourself and still go to heaven if that 's what heaven is I want none of it may you all feel better and live in heaven forever ill see you in hell	-1
I was really excited for a free Bible app with multiple translations . Then , after installing , I was disappointed to discover that it 's true that this app is always on , lurking and presumably gathering info on what I am doing . I force-closed it twice and it re-appeared in my & quot ; running apps & quot ; list even though I had not opened it .	-1
I rated this a one star to hopefully get the attention of the youversion developers . This app has the small font syndrome on the Kindle Fire . Lots of app that are not written for a tablet that I have tried on the Fire have similar problems . It makes the program only moderately useful .	-1
you might as well read a Dr. suess book . it is more believable . there once was a man from Nantucket	-1
But not start open guy close bible . My church not accept play anywhere in computer . List to pastor his are rules at church accept .	-1
This so called Army Survival guide is nothing but a poorly programmed copy of the FM 21-76.Go ahead and download the free and updated FM 3-05.70 instead . It has more information and no glaring errors.I take offense at momojo and developers like him that just want to make a quick buck from freely available materials.This sneaky dev also has multiple dummy Amazon accounts that are tagging the real and helpful reviews as bad . Another shameful practice , but what did you expect from someone that copies the work of others in the first place ?	-1
Ive never played this game . My sons and he didnt like it . So go off my review screen already now	-1
It does not fit to screen , only appears in a very small square at the top center of the screen . This makes it hard to view , read , and even give a decent review . HTC Vivid/Holiday .	-1
You can dig a hole with a cup inside covered with plastic to get water from condensation from the earth . Urine is very sterile , you can drink urine to get rehydrated .	-1
crashes on my kindle fire also . might work on phones , though . still looking for a decent game for this thing .	-1
I am really upset about the fact that there are not a lot of ports and I wish there were more men at the ports . and I wish there was more to the game . its a good fun game but there has to be a better way to make the game better . who ever mad the game is awsome	-1
I really dont remember playing this game so it is of course not on my phone and not being used	-1
All the fun of a spreadsheet minus a paycheck . The pirate theme is the only upside . Loosing will frustrate you , but winning wo n't be very fun either .	-1
its so stupid u need more men to capture forts and be able to have a fleet of ships . yeah I know it might ruin the game but the person who made the game can put more men at the ports and have the ships be even harder to capture . also the person who made the game could have enemy ships have a fleet as well . I have read that the creater couldent have a fleet of ships because it would ruin the game but I do n't think it would I think it would make it a lot better . I do n't think the person who mad this game knows how to make fleets and be able to capure more than one ship .	-1
My 3 year old does n't like this game . It does n't seem to have a purpose , sure you can put things places but there are other apps that do the same thing and provide more entertainment .	-1
I did n't like it , animals falling from the sky . My boys were n't interested at all should be deleted as an app	-1
The very young ones love this game but get bored quickly . The older ones say it 's really boring . Very easy to use . I 'd recommend it for the very young ones ( Age 1-2 ) . Good for waiting at the doctors office .	-1
I think there are better apps out there for single play . I do n't believe there were different games on it .	-1
This is supposed to be awesome ? Where is the awesome ? it is the most lamest game ever . 3 hands being the same . Where is the sound ? Where is the graphics ? this game sucks .	-1
1st off the deal button wont appear untill after ublindly search for it , the triple play feature is kinda pointless bc it just instantly gives u 2 more out comes , u should be able to select & quot ; hold & quot ; a second time in triple play mode . very basic and boring . give option to play against other people or something . anything to justify charging .99 cents for a game that should be free . having that said other than the missing deal button it runs fine , kinda choppy or laggy after button press sometimes . but not to bad . im rating it 2 stars bc this is not ready to be in the paid apps section . it needs more work and moar options of play . add a hold 'em game or stud . but there are much better video poker games that are free .	-1
Well , at least Amazon is allowed one fail a week . This app is certainly not worth one red cent . You would do well to stay away .	-1
bought for my kids . The paddles keep attracting each other like magnets . useless because they are stuck in the middle .	-1
About 20 people tried to download this via the UK Amazon App Store ; but when we went to install it , our Antivirus told us that it had an infection and to uninstall immediately..I immediately rang and told Amazon.co.uk and they actually noted it did have an infection ... ... So they said were going to remove it out of their App Store until they 've investigated what the problem was.Luckily I have Avast Antivirus , because this could of really damaged my Nexus 10 ... and I have n't even had it for a month yet ! If you are lucky here at .com to download and install this without encountering any problems like we are in the UK with this , ... I am very jealous as this does look to be quite fun and I think I can speak for the others that tried to install this but could n't .	-1
If your looking for a hockey game then go somewhere else . This game cost more than other hockey games . If you want something more than what the other ones have this is a great game for you , but if you just want a normal hockey game there are plenty of free ones .	-1
it is not virtual and is not worth two bucks of your time or hard earned money do not get it waste of my time and money	-1
Despite the decent graphics , the actual game play is extraordinarily boring . Would be much more fun if you actually raced instead of just placing bets and watching fake races .	-1
This has to be one the worst apps Amazon has offered . It ran but was so glitchy that had I paid for it , I would have asked for my money back plus pain and suffering reimbursement .	-1
Not much point to the game , you just bet on horses . I 'll admit the graphics are nice , but still , there 's zero & quot ; game & quot ; to this , more like a screensaver .	-1
I did not like this App at all , it was not easy to use , it frustrated me very much.I do not recommend this App at all .	-1
I got this when it was free at Amazon App Store , but I would never recommend it even if it was free all the time . Try running this in the background of your already battery intensive Droid and you 'll find your battery dead in a couple hours . I quickly uninstalled it for this very reason.On the plus side , this app does have a ton of options , fish and aquariums . So if you had your phone in a dock all day I guess this would n't be too bad . Definately not worth the cost though .	-1
The graphics are cool , but this thing kills my battery real quick . After about 4 hours I checked my battery usage and guess what ... this app used over 30 % .HTC droid incredible on froyo .	-1
This is not one of my top picks for apps , the wallpaper kind of sucks if you dont pay for the full version	-1
I have this program on my laptop and I love it , However this app wants you to purchase the full program after a few uses . Should NOT be listed as a & # 34 ; FREE APP & # 34 ; unless it is truly FREE . I will not PAY for a program TWICE .	-1
DOES NOT GET ANY POLICE RADIOS IN MY AREA ONLY FIRE DEPT . RADIOS ... .. WASTE OF TIME WRITING THIS REVIEW IT SUCKS	-1
I 've have listened to scanners a long time when you used to get the crystals and put them in your scanner yourself.Now we have gone to P-25 and digital encrytion and 800 mhz trunking.I downloaded this app their description of the app and what it does are very different.I would recomend this app to any who is serious abouy listening to a police radio or scanner	-1
read review upon my purchase . review after review said pass . does n't work . should have listened . good idea and would be fun to use but fails seems to be a better description .	-1
Even though free , it is not worth having simply because it would freeze or stop working . Every once in a while I can accept an app freezing but this was WAY TOO OFTEN ! I simply wanted to check out earthquakes but I will do so through different means .	-1
Unless you are nostalgic for your old Gameboy , there 's no point in trying this game . I only installed it because it was featured as the free app of the day , and I love 5 minutes of my life that I 'll never get back . Graphics , story , controls were all horrible with no consideration for the Android platform .	-1
do n't waste your time . definitely do n't waste your money . do n't even download for free . not fun , not interesting , not worth it . trying to uninstall now . not sure why this game was worth a sequel .	-1
if I could give it a zero I would ! ! I bought it and it said there was a error downloading try again . so I did . like 20 times . and I.still do n't have the game ! ! I.want my money back or the game ! ! ! : \	-1
... it seems to run fine . Unfortunately it just does not grab my attention . The graphics are cute but a bit overly compressed . 25 words are too many !	-1
I want to throw my device out the window and eat my body weight in chocolate and bacon for the 99 cents that I wasted on this app	-1
The game is alright unless you have an htc phone . If you do , one of the on screen control buttons is ridiculously close to the home button and you will accidentally hit home several times before getting frustrated and uninstalling the game . Also , it is a battery killer .	-1
I do n't what u people r talking about . this is n't suppose to ne for chit chat but its much better than reviewing it	-1
Not worth the down load space . It 's silly . Waist off time and energy . I do not recommend it to anyone . It 's just silly .	-1
as said many times before the whole rotating the screen thing does n't work on the kindlefire . on anything else it 's really fun , but I would like the problem to be fixed .	-1
It is silly and I had problems answering the questions and soon lost interest in it . You might like it .	-1
This is the worst item I have ever spent time downloading . There should be a way to TEST them without having to actually downloading them first . I wish I could remove it from my Kindle . Awful , simply awful .	-1
you only get one level and then you have to download the second one then u have to upgrade to get all of the other sections/levels	-1
1 . I install it2 . I play it3 . I realize it sucks4 . I uninstall it5 . I reinstall it6 . I play it again7 . I remember why I uninstalled it in the first place	-1
When I got this app I thought it would be fun but it does n't even work . Do n't get this app it sucks	-1
stupid	-1
was not what I expected . a wast of time . would not recomend this for anyone . there are games much better .	-1
Good app - fun to try but it does not fully work on the Kindle Fire . At the end of the first level you get to a part where you need to turn the device upside down and this is not supported on the Fire . Could n't go any further . Disappointed .	-1
as stated ... does n't support kindle fire . the arrow wont recognize when I flip my kindle . please fix ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I want to prove to my wife that I 'm not a Morin . : D	-1
Fun for a while then annoying as some tests require complete guesses which burn up.your chances then u have to start over.Thats when i uninstalled . Lame sorryTwenty word minimum twenty word minimum	-1
do n't get it ! it eats up ur memory and battery ! u can rack up hundreds of rollers without knowing and it cant be refunded	-1
I love this game and I just got a kindle fire for christmass so I ot this app , but when I was busy it clicked the sleep button and it froze it . I thought I had crashed it but after about 10minutes it started to work but do n't get this on the fire	-1
its ok i would finish it on ky kindle fire but it says incomplete it was fine without that though	-1
I can barely hit any of the buttons in this . I barely got past the first screen to skip feint . It wo n't let me into settings . If I try to play , the start button does n't work . Saw other reviews that this does n't work on other tablets either .	-1
This app will install . It will also run but when I select the Old School it goes to the next screen but will do absolutely nothing when I tap start .	-1
the first test is free and suddenly now you have to pay.99 ? ? the prices just keep raising ! do n't you just wish everything was free ! ?	-1
I think that this app is so stupid and whomever made this app is stupid too and I do n't know why anyone would wast $ 0.99 for this stupid app that makes no sense at all because all it does is ask you stupid question 's I most certainly hate this stupid app .	-1
all you people who say it works on kindle shut up it does not I hated the freakin crapy ass game	-1
they wnt even let me buy this is so stupid ... . I have every test and this is new and what I get is there is something an error with this task please try again later ... . stupid junk ! ! !	-1
Before install it asks for permission to modify ordelete SD card ? ? I might be a moron but I 'm not stupid ... install cancelled ... and why a 25 word minimum to review a bad app ? ? !	-1
I enjoyed this game on the iphone , but unfortunately it does n't run on my Motorola Atrix . The open feint support is a good touch . Hopefully they 'll get the newer phone support soon .	-1
This application looked promising but unfortunately it did not work on my motorola atrix . I will leave it installed and wait for an update that will hopefully fix this .	-1
as others , it force closes on moto atrix . any update for it to run on current phones ? ? anyone ever gotten it to work on an atrix ?	-1
its the worst game ever it took a month to down load and when it did down load my kindle broke down then I had to buy a new kindle then I bought the game again and was not happy because I had to spend 400 dollars for my kindles .	-1
first of all it called me a Moron . and who wants an app that does that . on my second try it made me puke all over my kindle and I threw it at the poster of this game and I had to get a new kindle fire and a new poster of a different game .	-1
It basically shows you how you can request free samples of products . While that technically falls into the free category I was hoping for something actually useful .	-1
should not be in top free list its a link to a website that has many problems with expired offers etc	-1
Not functional on the phone . All the free things are garbage . Do n't waste your time on this one folks . Head to woot for deals .	-1
This app is truly is a piece of crap , one of the worst ever created . Avoid it like the plague ! !	-1
this app i do n't think u like because its very hard to understand like u do something and if u do n't save or miss a process its does n't remember but how would the person know	-1
Force close off boot ? I am not surprised . Their other title , Flick Kick Soccer , had a nasty force close crash that ruined the whole game . Of course they never updated it , and this one fails to be near as entertaining . Shame .	-1
couldnt play . the splash screen says to flick to show the menu , but it would not flick . i could move it and see the menu , but the choices didnt work - just scrolled back up to the splash screen . sucks	-1
just a terrible copy of plants versus zombies . I hate this wannabe copy of a great game . I would n't wipe my rear end with this game .	-1
I have no idea what I am meant to do , since there is no help or instruction available.Apparently there IS a tutorial , but the video wo n't play . I get a helpful message telling me that it 's unplayable . Then , when given the choice to enter the briefing room ( instructions , tutorial ) the same thing happens . Blank then booted directly into the game.Samsung Epic 4g ,	-1
they just took plants vs zombies and made it worse then changed the title and sold it i do n't like it when they do that . i could make it zero stars : (	-1
fun game one star cause the video briefings wo n't play on my incredible 2. fix the video briefing issue and I 'll give it five stars .	-1
every time a person plays this somewhere plants vs zombie crys its self to sleep . this is a sorry excuse for a game , let alone a spot in my kindle fire . they could n't pay me to play this app . will not buy from this maker again .	-1
How is it possible to have ZERO permissions listed in the app 's desription ( Product Details ) , when the app includes Open Feint ? Is this an Amazon oversight or an intentional omission by the developer ? Regardless , seems like it would be Amazon 's responsibility to read what the developer has submitted as the app 's description and then make sure the developer lists permissions that are clearly needed for the app to function according to its claims in the gameplay description.In any event , I 'm surely not going to download this just to see if the installation asks for such permissions right before the install . So if anyone who has such knowledge about what the app asks for when installing , if anything , cares to share that with the rest of us , I 'm sure it would be appreciated by all .	-1
a poorly made ripoff of plants vs zombies . what the frog is this game . terrible effects too ! such a ripoff .	-1
its just like plants versus zombies , I 'm crying right now because plants verse zomblees is MY FAVORITE GAME EVER and these people just completely ripped them off . my making this game they spit in the following of faces:1.mine2.yours3.plants varse zombos makers4.Godif the makers of pants on zongies do n't sue these clowns then I think we should all band together and digit for them !	-1
Did n't enjoy playing this one , unfortunately . Thankfully it was free , so I do n't mind . But it took too long to open and did n't entertain me enough to keep on my Galaxy S3 .	-1
I was n't even going to bother writing a review , but I felt it was my civic duty to warn others of this POS that is trying to be a game .	-1
First of all I have never played Plants Vs. Zombies so consider this as unbiased as I can get . First and foremost the tutorial video wo n't play at all . Here 's a good idea for the future make the tutorial text based . That way at least it 'll work . You ca n't assume your audience will have YouTube access or will be playing it online . But this game is n't rocket science , nothing that a little trial and error would n't be able to deduce . But that being said I thought the game was overall bland and repetitive . Thanks for the free app of the day I think it would have been a rip off if I actually paid for this clearly unfinished game .	-1
This really is just a bad copy of a game I really like . Nothing against copies , sometimes they are better , but this sucks . Directions did n't work . No timer to tell you how long . Graphics are crap . In p vs z there are hints that zombie is going down so you can try to reinforce . But this seems less involved . Music very annoying also .	-1
If you look up shameless in the dictionary you would see this game . It feels cheap and rushed . I guess you ca n't copyright gameplay .	-1
stupidest game ive ever played . no instructions on how to play . from what I did figure out u placed ur stuff and watched . borrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring . am removing from my fire !	-1
This is a simple tower defense game . The alien attackers and military & quot ; units & quot ; match ability for ability , insofar as I can tell . The problem ? Besides the privacy implications of feint ? well , the thing crashes between every level and has started crashing in the middle of levels as well . If this was fixed , the app would deserve three stars , as it adds nothing to the warn genre.CM7 , captivate	-1
dumb . game . do n't waste ur time . boring . zzz zzz zzz zzzz zzzz zzz zzz zzz zzz zzzzzzzz zzzzzz zzzz zzz z z z z	-1
because , there 's more wrong with it then that : Open Feint , tutorial video wo n't load , and constantly crashes . Gameplay does n't look too bad but I would n't know .	-1
As with others , this game is a cheap knockoff of PvZ . It has several bugs and crashes often . I could careless about the graphics if the game at least played like what it 's trying to copy .	-1
The app worked well for half an hour , then force closed and locked my device necessitating battery removal and reboot . Samsung Epic . Uninstalled until the force close is resolved .	-1
When I opened it up the app only used half of my screen . Other than that , the game was just boring . Nexus S 4G .	-1
Nothong but force close when i play this app . I did get to play about 5 mins and it was fun till all force close when i score a goal . Using Sprint Photon 4g	-1
I am able to play this game for a few minutes at a time before it force closes on my Droid X . It seems to be pretty amusing until the FC and I await an update that will hopefully fix it .	-1
4 stars without the relentless force close issue . After kicking the first goal , like its the games job , force closes . : - ( disappointing	-1
Like a lot of people here worked really well the footwear really well the first time force closed every single time after that . Fun app when it works .	-1
Bummer . This game worked amazing when I downloaded last night . I played for about an hour around 2:30am , but now it force closes after every goal . Weird that it happens now , but worked fine when I first installed . Hope they update and fix this soon .	-1
Poor quality control on deveolper & apos ; s and Amazon & apos ; s part . App FC & apos ; s on 2 of my devices despite multiple attempts to getting to run . If it was meant to run only on certain devices , then state it as such . Bottom line , this POS is a Waste of time . Dev..learn platform programing	-1
At first opening , it was very fun to play . Now when I launch and start to play it FC & apos ; s everytime . I will play it when it gets fixed . Thank you for offering it for the FAOT Day ! \nSamsung Galaxy S 4G	-1
Would be a fun app if it didn & apos ; t crash all the time . Using a samsung droid charge . It loaded the first time , but never after that . Force closes after the game loads every time . Would be nice if it worked .	-1
I really enjoyed playing this game on my HTC Thunderbolt , but after about one week of play , it simply stopped working . Every time I opened it , it would crash . This makes me sad , as I really enjoyed this game a lot and looked forward to playing it more .	-1
see above . more stars when fixed . \n\nrandom crash when entering arcade mode . occurred four times in a row , crash occurs pretty often too .	-1
Seems like it could be fun but it constantly freezes and force closes on my HTC EVO 4g . Fix and it will be a good time passer .	-1
Almost always force closes on me , using HTC EVO 3d.\n\nIt does seem like a good time killer though . I will keep checking for updates and hope for a fix	-1
I installed this app and it force closed before I even got to play it for the first time . I tried it again and it played just fine . The game is kind if fun when it works . Unfortunately , it force closed every other time after I played it once , so I have to uninstall it .	-1
This game could be fun only if it doesn & apos ; t keep force closing on my Droid 2 Global . I am glad that I didn & apos ; t pay for this , or else it would be money wasted .	-1
this is very promising game . hope the author fixes the fc problem . I played another release by the same idea , about football ( not soccer ) .. wonderful game . this has promise too .	-1
kept crashing on my samsung epic 4g . do not recommend to install if your using samsung epic 4g . programmer plsfix this asap . thanks	-1
This was a very fun game at first with good graphics . Unfortunately it keeps force closing on my first kick every time I try to play it . I Uninstall and reinstalled but it still isn & apos ; t working ... HTC Droid Incredible	-1
force closes every time I kick the ball . worked day one but that was it . Dev needs to fix or its useless .	-1
This seems like a fun app . But like many others on here it keeps force closing on me . Dev needs to fix this problem . The one start is only because of the force close . Fix that and I would say for stars . Motorola Droid X ...	-1
It is no longer one of my apps . It was cumbersome and too difficult to try to figure out when looking for a specific verse	-1
downloaded the Olive Tree BibleReader , like it . I wanted the NKJV translation , it shows as being available on my Android phone in the Amazon App Store , but not on my Kindle Fires 's Amazon App Store . I went ahead and purchased on my Android Phone , from the Amazon App Store , hoping it would show n my Kindle Fire Amazon app store , for me to download and install it . Nope .	-1
This was mainly scripture and nothing wrong with that but i have downloaded a couple of versions of the Bible on my Kindle and this was not what I expected .	-1
No Kindle cause it crapped out on me . I do n't think I ever had this anyway . If I did I ca n't remember it . Another sorry .	-1
I was really looking forward to using this app , but it kept freezing every time I tried to open it . I tried to uninstall and reinstall , but it still did not work . Very disappointed .	-1
hard to work with . hard to search . I do n't think you should get this app . there are way better ones .	-1
It crashes a lot . To make matters worse , it 's gone from being a regular app to being a Kindle Tablet Edition , meaning that if something happens to it , I wo n't be able to reinstall it on my Galaxy Tab . Oh , well . There are other Bible apps out there , although this one comes with the ability to download commentaries , sermons , and the ability to compare versions . Unfortunately , you have to register to download them , and pay for most of them.Another thing is that in order to quit the app , you have to enter the menu and press `` EXIT , '' The back button wo n't take you out .	-1
Have hard time trying to get app book to work for me . Ca n't type chapter that I would like to go to . Settings do n't help .	-1
This free app immediately tells you it is expired after install and wont do a scan unless you purchase a subscription . It Also adds a notification that cnnot be cleared to the notifications area .	-1
this app is ok for tracking calories , but the diet plan menu is very unrealistic . I ca n't buy more than half of the items they have listed at my grocery store . I wish they would come out with an app like this for normal people and not iron chefs .	-1
Too basic to be useful . There are free apps that do more and do what this does better . do n't bother .	-1
I did n't even get to try this out within 6 hours my phone was dead . With it off I charged it and with in 2 hours it had drained 26 % of my battery . The only thing I had changed was putting this on my phone I did n't even get to try it out that 's how bad this was . I removed this app and in 2 hours the battery only went down 3 % . I normally get 30+ hours on my phone before it needs to be charged with this app it kept the phone awake the whole time and killed my battery . So please beware of it .	-1

Not really a private browser . It claims to erase your cookies , clear your history and cache after you exit the browser . I have found however , that it still stores a cache of websites you visit after you exit the browser . I give it two stars though because it does block some ads which does allow the browser to search and run faster than some other browsers .	-1
Useless on the Kindle Fire . I 'm glad it 's free . Ca n't import GPS coordinates automatically , so I had to memorize them and type them in manually , except that did n't work because it does n't log them , so when I back out it forgets what I put in .	-1
Openfeint ruins any game its on . Remove Openfeint please . Thank you ... Amazon ! Openfeint is not good ... at all . Do n't get this game if you hate being interrupted .	-1
You kick ... a ball ... through uprights.That 's it.Sometimes it 's windy . Ooh . Tricky.How bored would you have to be before this game became awesome ? I ca n't even imagine . Maybe Tom Hanks sitting on a beach busting his teeth out with an ice skate might find this game to be an awesome diversion . Maybe.On the other hand , the game is well made and the graphics are good . They did a good job creating a dull game .	-1
This should be called & quot ; Stool Kick Rugby & quot ; because it will wan na make you go number two after you play it .	-1
why would they offer this for free in the us we do n't play or even know how to play here in the states . epic fail ... .	-1
Yes , porn ... wow ... You do n't have to dig hard , just a little curiosity and you 're looking at porn ... Really ? ! Fix it now , and show some support to you 're consumers ... And do n't lie about you 're product ... Missing info is 'disinformation ' ... And can lead to expensive law suits.This product ( spite its PG nature ) should be restricted to 21 and older . Better yet , should be removed from Amazon for possible violations of human decency ... Lol ...	-1
After playing this game for several hours I developed tenosynovitis , a common cumulative trauma disorder . The repetitive nature of flicking the ball caused my finger to seize up , forcing me to see a doctor . Now my finger is wrapped with a brace and I 'm having do everything with my left hand . `` Some '' things take forever now ... Thanks a lot .	-1
I was under the impression that a yearly subscription allowed one to sync across all devices . This impression was reinforced when all my devices did sync ( laptop , iPod Touch , Kindle Fire , Android phone ) after my purchase . Several months later I received an email informing me that Keeper had `` inadvently '' synced all my devices . From now on only one device would sync and I would have to pay $ 9.99 for each additional device . So , I would have to play $ 40 , not $ 9.99 to sync my device.I went online to discuss this with Keeper and their response was slow as I waited for a answer to a question . I finally gave up and closed the page.I would not recommend Keeper . They are deceptive and unhelpful . There are other services that are honest and straightforward . Go with them , avoid Keeper and its `` inadvertent '' problems.Here 's the paragraph from the email they sent me : You are receiving this email because over the past few months we have inadvertently been providing you with Keeper Backup* , on one or more of your devices , beyond your one-year subscription term , at no charge . To correct this , we have recently updated our billing system to a new auto-renewal program that will go into effect this week . At that time , the premium features of Keeper Backup* will only be available on authorized devices within your account .	-1
Not what I was looking for and it was very buggy on my Android ICS 4.0 Tablet . . . .	-1
It requires a paid subscription after a while I keep getting spam mail from them asking me to renew . I would not buy not worth it .	-1
Every update is worse than the last . It seems your programmers are almost as bad as your journalists . The reason is simple . AOL has n't put put a good program in a long time .	-1
Would like to read Top Stories , but all I get is a white screen with one tiny little ad . Uncool . Kindle Fire HD .	-1
I got this game for free and it is cute but you have no control basicly and it is just stupid just talk English like every other game for the main character	-1
All that you do in this game is move around your bubble so that it does not get hit by the rocks . you can direct the rocks away from you or blow them up . very simple and got old fast .	-1
I have tried multiple times to play this game but I just really ca n't get into it . It is one of those games that makes you wish it was more fun or there was more to it . Nevertheless try it you may like it and see something I do n't see .	-1
Overall it seems like a fair game . Unfortunately it is ruined by the grammar Buka utilizes.Pro : Smooth play . Bright colors . Potentially kid friendly.Con : Ruined with the use of atrocious grammar . I would love to allow my kids to use this , however I am afraid the butchering of the English language would negatively influence them.I assume the developers where trying to make Buka speak cutely . They went overboard and ruined the game .	-1
I love the & quot ; look & quot ; of the game ! Running and shooting ninja stars was fun , but the jumping ruined the game . Character should jump when pushed , not realeased ( unless I was & quot ; charging & quot ; my jump , but I did n't think it was ) . fun style , just needs some controls fixed .	-1
This game would be great if the rope worked , they should have gotten rid of the rope to begin with . The running , jumping and throwing work great .	-1
first off this app does not even have good grafhics on the kindle fire and second off u do n't do much.I say this app should be rated all 1star reviews because if sucks . DONT GET THIS APP IT IS SO BORING	-1
Very very basic . If you do the same thing every week and you cant remember what it is you do then you must have major memory issues . So on that note how are going to remember to check this app . It does what it says which is not a whole lot or is it worth 2.39 .	-1
but this app fails in the worst possible way , it does n't sync with Google Calendar . I ca n't see where it syncs with anything . The lack of sync makes this a fail .	-1
The [ phone and tablet ] built in planners/calendars are much better , not to mention this app takes up too much space than what its worth .	-1
Never really got the opportunity to use this application but may still download it in the future and try it out .	-1
Please Amazon , if developers do n't give the option of app2sd do n't sell it in the market , this app is fairly good but not that importantto waste valuable phone space .	-1
looks decent enough but needs Google Calender sync before it can really be used . alternatively a way to sync with outlook might be good too .	-1
Too basic for me with no Google Calendar sync . But looks good if you want something simple because it does backup your information.For the people who are one starring it because it 's not the latest version : If you contact Amazon , they will tell you that they review updates on apps before they are posted here . Yes , it 's a dumb policy .	-1
As much a I like the idea , its poorly executed . Its graphics are low quality and its resolution sucks on my Droid Incredible 's screen . The sound sucks and its incredibly laggy . Hell , even the free Skyrocket live wallpaper , which has ads only in the settings kicks this to the curve . Its a fireworks live wallpaper thats really gorgeous if you want one .	-1
Pixelated . Skyrocket is much better.This could be really cool though : the smoke and glow effects are pretty nice.Just make the thing higher res ! : - )	-1
I have the Watchdog app that monitors the performance of my other apps and my phones battery life . This wallpaper was off the charts on usage and was draining my battery like crazy . Not to mention the sounds are the most annoying thing you 'll ever hear in your life ! Luckily you can disable them ... . Do n't even waste your time downloading this one ... .	-1
Poor graphics and poor sound effects defeat the main purpose of the app ( if that was indeed the main purpose ) . Then there 's questionable permission requirements for network access . Why ? There 's no ad , so does this app need network access . This feels a lot like a poorly disguised spyware , than anything else .	-1
It was okay . Looked like fireworks . The only & quot ; setting & quot ; you can change is sound , a little lame . The animation was really slow . Would NOT pay $ 2 for this . In fact , I uninstalled the free download .	-1
This did nothing but crash both my EVO 3D and my Samsung Tab . I 've uninstalled on both and ca n't recommend this app for anybody . I certainly ca n't recommend BUYING the app , much less installing it .	-1
I can come by your home and throw a bag of garbage on your front lawn . For free . Just give me your Social Security number so I have something to work with .	-1
Graphics are pixelated and slow . I 've seen better . If you want a really good firworks live wallpaper , try Firerocket . It 's Opengl and much more realistic .	-1
not worth it . glad it was free . uninstalled as soon as downloaded . nice idea but was n't real looking in my opinion .	-1
This is a terrible Free App of the Day . There are MUCH better free live wallpapers . Plus , the five star reviews are SO written by the developer or his/her friends . Do n't waste your memory or battery life on this trash . Developer is a schemer ...	-1
I got Watchdog as another free app of the day some weeks ago , and thought it was n't working since it never gave any alarm about dozens app ( some very graphic intensive ) I have/had . But this sure enough got the alarm triggered . Well , at least this bloatware tested my other app ! Uninstall !	-1
Droid2 Global ( Verizon ) running FroYo 2.2 - I have tried to install ( and then uninstalled ) it three or four times , with no success at all . Ca n't judge if it is any good , since I ca n't even get it to install correctly . I am going to watch some real fireworks instead of wasting more time trying to install fake fireworks on a phone . Never before had a problem installing any app at all .	-1
On my Droid X the sound only plays in set up mode.Graphics are not anything like the icon leads you to believe , but they are very poor.Live touch works on the wallpaper , but every time you leave an app it sets off a slew of new fireworks that I bet are eating up a lot of power.Kinda fun but really not worth it .	-1
I have seen better fireworks in Mario for super nintendo . Booooooo . Terrible . You have offended America . Go back to computer graphics school .	-1
This app DOES NOT have live images . NOT Live images , only static pictures . What a waste of space . Crap app .	-1
It was n't a favorite or some then i would keep.I read and deleted for space purposes.To each is ownThanks for reading = )	-1
ok this game gets supper slow and boring because all u do is jump there 's no point to this game	-1
this game is simple and stupid.the graphics are okay , but the main idea of the game is just retarted.I played for a few minutes and got bored.sunflat usually makes good games , but this one just retarted .	-1
it sucks and I 'm 14 do n't buy it its not worth its money . its graphics are horrible the units are hard to use do n't buy it .	-1
papijump is a terrible rip off of doodlejump . I actually enjoy papi games so this was somewhat of a letdown . I do n't know how it got four stars , but it certainly did n't deserve them . its doodlejump but without everythingthat makes doodlejump fun : powerups , moving/dissapearing platforms , and monsters/blackholes . honestly just get doodlejump.p.s . doodlejump is also nicer to look at .	-1
listen its awful . but check out papiwall now that 's addictive . please listen to me . its the truth . thank u for listening	-1
papi jump is a copy of Doodle jump completly and its not even fun and I will tell this to anyone who ythinkes of buying it do not ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
If you have a problem with motion sickness , this game is not for you . It only took me seconds to know it was not for me . Removed from fire .	-1
ok platforms but even worse than pikajump if u know what it is . the face becomes creepy after a while .	-1
For me this program was not user friendly . Perhaps is not compatible with my Acer tablet , but I was not even able to send my first text ! There were to many buttons to push ! I am computer savvy , but this one was difficult for what should be simplicity .	-1
this app works as advertised but it has too many DATING SERVICES pop up ads . Not good if you want to installe this in your kid 's phone .	-1
overall its pretty smooth along with some nice animations ... although it seemed cool at first after a while it started to slow my Asus eee pad TRANFORMER down ... good looking live wallpaper but uninstalled till better compatibility is a lot better on tablets .	-1
I can not get this update . I tap on update and NOTHING happens , please fix ! Thanks . Samsung Galaxy S II 2.3.5 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .	-1
My lookout one day told me this has viruses on it so I took it off and have not used it or re-downloaded it since .	-1
this aoo is more like a virus than an app once ya get it you are stuck ... with the technology today they could make sure a person isnt harassed to update things they hate	-1
I 'm frustrated that new fish are promised but never delivered . This app has seen ZERO improvement since my purchase . There are a lot of fish missing especially African Cichlids and Tetras . Two of the most common fish out there !	-1
Does not work on my Pandigital Novel Tablet due to lack of control ( no keyboard ) and/or video display not displaying the game app correctly .	-1
never try this game my friends all said this games sucks steamy buns worst game evr I agrr wit my friends	-1
this game is just like Doodle jump but somehow the bottom of the screen is solid so you can never lose	-1
Thought I would try this app after all the good reviews ... Followed the directions and it wo n't connect to my PC ... Double checked all settings ... Oh well ... Looking for a good PC control App , glad I did n't pay for it	-1
It was cool to use this and see my desktop on my phone . Apparently not compatible with Gingerbread , Android 2.3 operating system Bionic phone . Too bad . Would have loved it .	-1
Good thing it was free . It wo n't install to LG Vortex Rooted Froyo 2.2.2.Some apps will say they 're not compatible . This one does n't .	-1
Fine if you want to leave your computer at home unprotected at all times ... It seems a strange way to emulate RDP . Just my thoughts at a glance .	-1
I only tried the app for a bit , while sitting at my computer . It connected , I could drive around my desktop , launch apps , etc . Seemed to work OK.My first concern was when setting up a security code , it did n't allow me to use a special character ( A ' ? ' in this case ) . This is a bad sign for security . So is the maximum of 20 characters . It means there is a good chance they are n't hashing the password.Also , no where on the site did I see mention of encryption . The support pages I looked at said there was none.This boils down to the fact that if I am on open WiFi ( like Starbucks where no password is required ) that anyone sniffing the WiFi traffic ( trivial to do ) can see the password , then log themselves into my machine.That is a bad thing.If you need an app like this , look for anther solution .	-1
I used to love the app and teasing my son with it when he was using my computer , but it no longer connects my phone and computer . It truly sucks and annoys me a lot ! It wo n't even attempt to connect !	-1
Not sure why this App is working so great for everyone else , but it surely is not for me . First , I tried to pull up a You Tube video , which it finally did , but the audio was terrible , it kept crackling and going off and on . Then I tried to pull up one of my own videos on my computer , and it just locked up my Kindle Fire . Oh , well ... ... ... .enjoy everyone , I 'm deleting . AI N'T NOBODY GOT TIME FA DAT !	-1
This app does n't support streaming from a Linux desktop . A travesty in the Android world ! There 's not much else to say . Its a pretty useless app .	-1
This app used to be my go to app to control my computer but since they announced splashtop 2 and `` upgraded '' the streamer , splashtop 1 's performance went down the drain . on hspa with full signal , I 'm lucky to perform 3 actions before the screen freezes and I have to log out then back in for a refresh.They intentionally crippled splashtop 1 i n hopes of getting you to pay a monthly fee for splashtop 2 to be able to access your system outside the LAN.The splashtop streamer is also extremely annoying . there is no option to start up minimized . you have to minimize the streamer everytime you start the computer up . it 's another shameless way to advertise their new stuff.UPDATE : I have complained to the techsupport and it seems that the new streamer has been crippling splashtop 1 . They sent me a direct link to an older streamer that works fine when streaming over 3g and other wireless networks . [ ... ] Hope that helps everyone else .	-1
This app is great but two things make it unusable for me:1 ) You can not configure it for a proxy2 ) It doesnt work with Swiftkeysonce they fix this it would be a five star app , but I hear that Splashtop support has been convieniently ignoring these issues .	-1
I could n't set it up without using my email . I also cant draw using programs like paint on my kindle . the only thing that can be done it viewing things , and editing documents . could be better . slow , lagging .	-1
this was a terriable app . and a terriable expeirence ! the appp equires the gmail account from google . it would never sign in ! i could never get it to sign in to my google account ! you can not contact the company ! what a bust . it was all here . google said they could help me figure it out but for 15 bucks ! i found anoter remote appTEAMVIEWER on here in the amazon app store . and it was free . had it up and running in no time . i wanted it for games . it works . the only hitch is background sounds . there arent any . its made for confernce calls but can be used in a at home non commercial user capacity.it does what it says and it did not require it be syncrinized to anything ! i put my kindle on the google side for registration of the app and usage . i did it make it a 2 step authentication process to access the google account when i sign in from my kindle for security reasons . you must list a phone number with google to set up the 2 step authentication . they will call the number with a code for the kindle to sign in . the code is sent as soon as you attempt to sign in . your kindle will hold it in memeory . its really pretty easy to install and use the Teamviewer app.i feel ripped off from splashtop . id never recc0mmend this app . and im out 4.99 plus tax ! !	-1
All you really do in this game is get some guns and shoot these little targets that come and go every 3 seconds . So if your looking for a good game this is probally not the one your looking for . Please LIKE my review.P.S , If I have any spelling mistakes than can you tell me if I do please ?	-1
Crashes with a forced closed whenever opened . I wish I never downloaded this app . Please , do not give this company any money .	-1
i had to get this for the free app ... but it wo n't open ... force closes everytime ... i still love the game but I 'd like the HD version for my droid rAzr maxx and my xoom ... maybe an issue with Motorola devices ?	-1
after a long week and having to wade through my apartment garage yesterday I was ready for a day of rest . so I downloaded the faotd and prepared for fun . I loved space invaders as a kid so I felt this would be fun . unfortunately before I could start playing I had a knock at the door . it was my boy Henry who had a pizza with him I thought what could be better than a free app and a free pizza . to bad henry did n't tell me he added the mushrooms to the pizza . next thing I knew I was being attached by giant glowing space ships and I even threw a chair out my front window . beware of this app because it is too realistic .	-1
I ca n't even get the game to launch ( and it looks like several others have the same problem ) . I 'll update this review as soon as they patch the game to get it working on my Droid X .	-1
Program force closes as soon as its opened.Tested on Epic 4g . This app is clearly still in the beta testing phase and not ready for a wide spread roll out .	-1
Have had my Thunderbolt for a year now , this is the only app that I could n't even open . Force closes every time .	-1
hate leaving bad reviews but since the app force closes every time I try to open it on my HTC Rezound I have nothing positive to say .	-1
Was n't even able to open the game due to it force closing . 1 star due to this but will rate later if I can open it . Thankfully it was free	-1
all this does is force close it never loads . no wonder it is free . rubbish.force close force close force close force close	-1
Friend Caller is n't what they say it is . I just downloaded this application 5 minutes ago and from the start I knew it was n't for me . I was going to try to call one of me friends when a message came up : & quot ; you only have $ 0.10 credits be careful & quot ; . So after I read this I instantly became confused , my first though was what is credits and why do I need to pay if this application is supposed to be & quot ; free & quot ; . From the comments posted here it seems like people just adore to Free Caller , but I totally disagree . I believe whoever made this game is a hypocrite because if you can make free calls and texting why in the world do you have to pay ? That right there proves my point , free means nothing you have to pay for AT ALL ! This game is a waste of data and was a waste of my time , you may love this application , but I do n't ! Free Caller does n't deserve 4 starts let alone the rating I 'm forced to give it .	-1
This app SUCKS ! If you 're looking for a free calling app , dont get this one ! It charges you to call people . In the thing it says FREE calling. ! Then at the bottom it explains that you have to pay . I DONT RECOMMEND !	-1
I do not use this app . Never used it.I prefer to utilize other apps that were installed on my phone when I got it .	-1
the touch controls are delayed it wo n't work on anything I tried ipad , kindle fire , iphone . do n't waste your money or space unless you have the cloud .	-1
way too hard . controls need work . nothing to make it special from other shmups . graphics are not bad . more enemy variety needed .	-1
To start , the font used in the application is complete rubbish . It is difficult to read , but it does convey the overall poor quality of the game ( so at least the menu prevented high hopes ) . The tilt control proved completely useless ( probably because there is no angle calibration ) . The collision detection is rather primitive as well . Overall this game was a dud . I 'm just glad I received this via the free app of the day . If I had actually paid for this , I would be extremely upset . As it stands , I am only inconvenienced by the time spent installing , trying and then promptly removing the program .	-1
this is the worst app I got ... do n't spend your time downloading and wasting memory on this cheap , bad app.listen to the reviews.take My word ... .oh and I do n't want to even put a star for this review ... 0 stars .	-1
I 'll admit to having high standards for this genre right off . That said , this is as generic as they get . Excluding the fact that it feels like the real enemy is controlling the ship , there are generic enemies , graphics , sound , music , and bullet patterns . You 've played it before so why play it again ?	-1
Graphics are choppy , low res only . touch controls unresponsive and jumpy . Lame ! Do n't waste your time because of good reviews this game sucks.big time .	-1
It 's okay for being free , but I would never pay anything for this . Lacks a lot of polish . Runs fine on Kindle Fire .	-1
It 's got that `` Hey guys check out my first app ! '' feel to it that a lot of Android games have , that hopefully will improve . On the surface it is n't bad , relatively cheap , and performs ok. My issue is the lack of originality , pretty much making a copy of the already many copies of this type of game . If you like `` retro ( READ : Basic ) '' shooting games like this , it may entertain you for a minute . But there are other , higher quality games like this out there for the same price . Flip a coin , write some games on some slips of paper and pick one , it 's the same as the others.I think this genre is way overdone , for free , it 's ok , but not something I 'd actually pay for , but if it 's your thing , go for it , it is only a buck the other 364 days of the year ( although most of the reviews will be from the one day it was free ) . Not sure there would be as many 5 stars if people paid for it .	-1
I honestly wanted to like this game ... But it just has so many issues.1 . Before you even start playing the game it takes forever to actually start playing . You habe to go through 3 or 4 screens before you can even start.2 . The graphics on the start screens are very hard to read because the grapgics are very poor.3 . Once in the game it is very unresponsive . Responsiveness is a must in any type of game but especially for this type where you have things flying at you and you have to shoot and dodge.Hopefully the devs will work on the issues ... Otherwise I just cant see too many people getting this app .	-1
No doubt a decent amount of time was put into this , but it feels like a really sloppy game . I feel that if they put a bit more effort that they might have a pretty decent game here .	-1
hate to hate on a game but the lack of control makes the game near unplayable . needs a lot of work	-1
bubble buster stinks . all you do is shoot bubbles and try to bust bubbles . except , the bubbles NEVER bust . and when you lose , ( always ) it calls you a loeser . it stinks . do n't get it .	-1
can not figure out . how to shoot the ball the instructions are so small you cant read them.would not get again glad it was free	-1
cant control the direction of the ball and its very frustrating . the help browser is no help . I truly dislike this game . : (	-1
coulda been better . not exactly an addicting game . has an appeal to most puzzle game types . I like world hardest game better	-1
each level makes you have to go faster to get rid of the bubbles in the higher level . my nerves can not shoot like a machine gun so I am stuck on a level I can not continue before losing . not enough time before they hit bottom . disappointed in it . I am a gamer at 55 in my spare time .	-1
I ca n't control the aim or firing control at all . I tried several different times because I really wanted this to work . I 'm really sorry to have to uninstall this . Fix for EVO 3D , and I 'll give this another try .	-1
I 'd like this app a lot better if the bubbles did n't overhang the playing field on the right side , if the bubbles below the playing field did n't jitter annoyingly while I 'm trying to concentrate on the game and if the bubbles went where I pointed . The bubbles also look awful . Do n't know what they were going for , but the bubbles look flat and unfinished . Like the app never completely loaded . They looked much better before the update . Played on my Kindle Fire . Uninstalled .	-1
I got this app when I first got my kindle . I liked it at first but now I hate it because it never goes where you want it	-1
I hate this game u would think this game looks cool but its not I mean . whoever envented this game sucked at it . this game is messed up	-1
I love bubble blast . It 's a way to pass a lot of time . It says there was a fix , but everytime I have tried to download and redownload it , a message comes up saying it is incompatible . I would like to play though if the problems could be fixed .	-1
it was better before all the upgrades its super hard to tell the colors apart . this game should be downgraded back to the clear bubbles that everyone loved : (	-1
It was ok , and it performed well . But i ended up removing it , it just became boring after awhile . Not to mention the exactness needed in later levels is almost impossible to perform on a touch sceen	-1
The graphics are something you would expect to see in a kiddies cartoon . And the controls are really off ! A real waste of time . I refuse to clutter my Kindle with such basic game ! ! !	-1
This game could be so much fun , but it 's absolutely terrible . I just downloaded the new update hoping for better controls but no . this game is n't even playable on the kindle !	-1
this game does not work on kindle fires ... do n't waste your time downloadingv this . I 'm deleting this as soon as I 'm done with this review .	-1
This game is fun to play but the aim gets very frustrating because its not consistent , it goes from being very precise to way off from shot to shot . I have also noticed that the graphics on the bottom of my screen for level , score etc are totally unreadable . All in all for a free app to play for a few minutes here and there its ok .	-1
This game seemed like it would be fun . Unfortunately , at least on the Kindle Fire , you could not control where the ball was shot to to burst the bubbles . Perhaps others have had better luck than I had .	-1
this game would probably be fun if it worked properly.No matter where the arrow is pointed the ball always lands some where else . Also it is hard to steer ! THis game needs the bugs worked out . I am deleting it off my Kindle .	-1
This is a frustrating game . The ball often goes up to a centimeter to the left or right of where you point it . There is no rhyme or reason to which side it will decide to go to ...	-1
this is a horrible game ! why do the bubbles not go where you want them ? I couldnt get past level 63 ! un-in-stall . period .	-1
This is a really bad game It worked but its a really boring . game . if I could I would give it a 0	-1
This plays very well and is a lot of fun BUT it force closes on my Fire constantly . Would give it 5 stars if this got fixed ! !	-1
Very disappointed because I downloaded this app just like all others I chose to try out . I could n't wait to play it . But when you open the app it says click on free to try now . Or something like that . You click on FREE button and it takes you to another app so you have to down load that one so the first one is free to play . Then when you go to play the 2nd one it takes you to another app you have to down load in order to play app # 2 . And this goes on and on . EVERY TIME YOU OPEN IT to play .	-1
Was enjoying this game on kindle fire untill the update tbat changed how the game looks . No longer looks like this pic with bright easy see colors - new version is no fun because the colors are to similar . Please go back to the old look and then I ' ll reinstall .	-1
would n't work corretly on the kindle Fire ... .wish these apps had warnings so i would n't bother to download . Looks like it would be fun if ya get the dang thing to work ! !	-1
I could not figure it out ! ! ! ! '' It stinks ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! it is so hard ! do not download the app.it is so boring unless your a geek .	-1
I play this game whenever the mood strikes . It 's just not what I expected from a bubble game . Do n't play it much but like have it handy for when I want to do something different !	-1
No different than any other bubble busterno better no worse.9 more words are required for a review.the end .	-1
For me , this was not a very good game . I found it difficult to use and navigate and it would often freeze up . I bought this game for my phone and it was much better . I think it really depends on the system you are using it for . I would not recommend this game .	-1
DID NOT CARE TOO MUCH FOR THIS . JUST WAS N'T MY KIND OF GAME , I GUESS . A BIT BORING FOR ME .	-1
I Guess this game could be for smaller children but I did not care for it my self waste of time	-1
Rarely do I absolutely hate a game . In fact , to date this is the only one I 've ever actually hated.I downloaded the game because it was a bubble shoot ( love those ) AND because I believed what they said above about it having `` options for ... [ the ] timer '' and `` [ a ] settings screen ... '' .On the Kindle Fire there are no such things . I had my son look at it , just to make sure that I did n't miss anything and no surprise , he agrees . So let 's go over all that it is lacking on Kindle Fire ( I can not speak for other devices ) .1 . There are absolutely zero settings at all.2 . There is no timer option . I wanted a timer option because I hate timers . I do n't mind games that have them , so long as I can turn them off . I have a busy life and ca n't always just keep playing because the timer is going and the game wo n't stop.3 . There is no way to get back to the game home screen ( not the KF carousel , but game home screen ) . This is not to be confused with the KF 's back button , that will do it , but the game itself has no option at all to get to its own home screen.4 . There is no ability to pause the game , except to use the KF home button.For me , this game is a total fail all the way around . There is not one single thing about this game that I like and it is going to be permanently removed from my KF.If you have a Kindle Fire and do n't mind timed games , not being able to pause it and not being to get back to its own home screen , then this game is for you . Otherwise , steer clear .	-1
I dont like this game it is a bit boring to me ! I have found other bubble games that have more effects that make it a bit more interesting then just popping bubbles	-1
Sorry I have to give this such a bad score.Maybe it needs better direction , becauseI have just never ben able to figure it out quickenough so have just moved on to something .	-1
This might be fun but it did not work properly . The Bubble Launcher would not launch the bubbles and you could not make any bubble matches . I tried reload but the same thing happened . I was very disappointed .	-1
Used to like this a lot . Today 's update reintroduced the scrambled fast vibrating bubbles at the bottom of the screen on the kindle fire . I think this is supposed to be an ad line . The update before changed from black & amp ; blue to light blue & amp ; dark blue which do n't have enough contrast .	-1
not as responsive as i would have liked , I had tried to give it several chances but I finally ended up deleting it .	-1
controls are awful . it would be better if you could just tap the guy and tap where you want him to go rather than having to drag him all over the screen to move him . very frustrating and really takes away from the game . uninstalling	-1
do n't download ... unless you enjoy constant crashes and losing all your saved data . it would be 5 stars if it worked though .	-1
Great game just need to fix the crashes or save the game more frequently on the fire . fix this and ill continue playing and will give a 5	-1
Thank the Lord this was free ... still trying to figure out the point of this app . I think I know what it 's supposed to do , it just does it VERY poorly .	-1
I too am glad this app was free . I tried it for a couple of days , but it 's so damn ugly that I ditched it . Since it provides no features that are n't accomplished better by other apps , it really has no redeeming qualities at all .	-1
I got it as a free app and used it for a day and decided it was n't even worth taking up space and removed it .	-1
The interface is similar to the classic Blackberry home screen profile . If you are coming from a blackberry background , you might like it . If not there are other apps that are similar that do n't need apps added in .	-1
Every once in a while when I wake my phone up from sleeping I 'll just have a blank screen . There will be no option to unlock my screen or anything . I have to hard reset my phone just to unlock the screen .	-1
why use this ? when the phone already does every single thing this app does without wasting more space and battery ?	-1
I was eager to use this app as a nice way to view and respond to calls and SMSs from my lock screen , without having to unlock and open the phone or messaging apps . Configuring this app was very challenging , requiring a lot of trial and error ( though maybe I 'm just not very clever ) . And I could n't bypass the lock , though I suppose that 's a good thing.However , after I got it working close to how I wanted it , I realized that this app was causing my phone to freeze up and then crash ( Samsung Galaxy S , Android 2.3 ) . After I uninstalled it , the phone was back to normal .	-1
I found this app to be redundant . The only positive is that I could get a preview of my email , instead of opening gmail . The reader and twitter apps did n't do customization , so I could n't see JUST my DMs or replies on Twitter , or starred articles in the reader app . I got rid of it .	-1
Sorry just didnt find the app to do anything worth having it for .. maybe others will like it .. i gave it a 2 because i dont want to be to harsh .	-1
Please add support for taskos for 5 stars . T H A N K S ... .. . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . .. . . .. . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . ..	-1
this app keeps causing my screen to lock up , i had to uninstall as it kept making my touch screen completely non responsive , i did like the features on the app . fix the screen issue and I will reinstall	-1
The person below me is right.love is not something to calculate.it is something a person feels.the thing that makes our world go round , is LOVE !	-1
Worst app ever it 's so stupid all you do is type in names and does n't work do n't waste space on your kindle or the time downloading it	-1
I do n't really know why I bought this . I guess I was just bored . I really do n't get why people might believe these things .	-1
This `` app '' add-on for Executive Assistant is supposed to add a library to your POP3 accounts that will launch when you click on any of the notifications in the widget . However , I kept getting a warning on my Thunderbolt saying that `` Loading the library may take a few seconds '' when I tried to configure it . Then the warning went away and I was on the same screen as before . It just didnt work for me .	-1
I found the app to be not very user friendly . The app seems difficult to use . Would not recommend as I am sure there have to be other apps which are better if you enjoy playing casino games .	-1
game is fine . hard at first but then ot just repeats so gets very boring very quick . which is a shame because it has promise	-1
no method to control the helicopter on the nook color . he graphics are also not showing up right . some are cut off and others seem to not fit my nooks resolution	-1
no instructions and stuff like that , do n't get the game and its hard to steer the Damn helicopter . I 'm giving it one out of five .	-1
This does nothing more than the OEM programs on your device can handle . Truly a lazy man 's app if you 're so inclined .	-1
open app and it shows a black screen with the game designers name on it says something stupid calling ne a private or something has theme music but then that 's all game wo n't open	-1
You were right it takes way too long to load I 'm not waiting either . I hope no one makes the mistake I did .	-1
No one can ever win this game ! ? It is always a tie ! ? This a chess game for the & # 34 ; everyone gets a blue ribbon & # 34 ; parents . NOT for anyone who actually wants to play a real game of chess on the go . Would NOT recommend .	-1
it has good graphics yes , but it wont let you move to the right places . I think anyone who downloads this game is wasting their time .	-1
did not like the board setup at all , the board is to little and hard to see to move . it 's ok if you can see it	-1
This could be fun but the letters kept changing between landscape and portrait mode . They moved so much I could n't pick them .	-1
Downloaded game for free and then paid to be able to play off line single player . Played for a while and now , all of a sudden , there is an advertisement after every game ! I really like the game , and I do n't like leaving bad reviews , but this is very frustrating !	-1
an uninstall for me . i just tried playing several different styles , and the app does n't always recognize when you hit a button , and wo n't recognize that letter no matter how many times you hit it . at first i thought it may be my screen or my phone , but the 'dead ' letters and buttons show up in every round of the game , but in different places , basically making this app unplayable . MyTouch 4G	-1
ahhh another word search app that no one wants as the faotd ... ... . Not even I like this game and I 'm a college student , just looks boring ... . 1 star for faotd ( fliping backwards because of my review yet ? no seriously you mad bro ? : D )	-1
Six meg and no move to SD card equals deleted . I like this sort of game usually , but not enough to give it that much space .	-1
Update : Just got informed by the dev this app is gon na have push service or polling added on a future update . No way is Urban Airship or a similar service gon na be accepted by me , or a polling service where their servers can communicate with phone any time they feel like it along with internet permission being added . Everybody make sure you download Push Detector app so you can see for free which of your apps have this or added it on update . Push is the service that devs use to push those nasty ads and messages to your notifications bar , too , and you dont know which offending app is doing the dirty deed unless you download a push detector app to scan them all and know which you should delete ! ! ! Sorry dev , but adding push service or silent background polling that works without our knowing its happening will not be widely accepted as an update to this app ! ! ! What were you thinking ? ? ? ? ? Dev also says it might Amazons fault about something making the App2SD function not working . Not sure what that means but he said he contacted Amazon abt it . Look to the future to see if it was correct and if it moves to SD as claimed it should have beenWord games belong on the SD card , not 6mb on the phones memory . Would it have been so hard to let it go to SD ? ? ? Thats why mega size SD cards were invented ! ! ! To clear up phones internal memory to save it for important things that have to be run off of it ! ! ! Enter key needs to be at the botttom not the top not bottom . Letters do need to be touching unlike some other games which is fine but shoulda said that clearly in a splash screen or something cause now many are confused and dropping 1 star bombs on the app for assuming its played differently . Tap method is good if you need to play slower and think while playing but emphasize the swipe and the letter touching to avoid confusion . How about an untimed option too for when you do not need an adrenaline rush or to see if you can get every single word which you cant do in 3 minutes ? Needs a little work but if social gaming gets added and this does not get moved to the SD , it will be another relic in the FAOD downloads that you get and delete later when cleaning up your phone for memory hogs and games you do not play because there are similar better ones available . One more thing , different skins as an option would be cool and add interest .	-1
I am so disappointed in this app now . I am going to delete it from my device and the cloud . My kindle fire died and I waited for the fire HDX to come out . I did n't open my apps for a few months . When I got my new fire hdx , this was the first app I went to . What an unhappy surprise . Revisions made to this app removed all the joy out and replaced it with irritation . I wish I could give it a rating of zero or minus one . Seems I am limited to changing the rating down to two as the lowest I can go ... what 's up with that ? ... ..Here was my original review ( before revs ) ... . I love this app . I play this with my morning coffee every day . I 'm not very good at it , but hey , I 'm only trying to beat my last score . ( 15 words seem to be my Max limit ) . If I could change anything on this app , I would like to have the ability to lenghten the time limit . it 's so much fun to play .	-1
i downloaded the game to give it a try but i hated it . i deleted not only from my kindle but from my account altogether . feel free to try but not good imo .	-1
umm ... yes I can make words and change orientation but where 's the challenge here ? it just says new game , no leader board or challengers ... is it just me or is that boring ?	-1
This game needs so much work it should not have been released yet or even offered for free poor graphics and bad set up do not waste your time or the space to down load	-1
This game is hard to use and not as good as Scramble or Ruzzel . I do n't play this Scramble Touch game anymore .	-1
Gameplay is horribly skewed ( by several thousand points ) by player 's ability to buy bonuses . You can no longer play the game offline without paying for the function as well . All-in-all , pretty much worthless unless you plan on shelling out a bunch of extra cash .	-1
Even as a FAOD this offering leaves a lot to be desired . The most flaring feature is the limitation of the games internal dictionary . If it does not contain a word it ca n't be used no matter how common or & quot ; everyday & quot ; it might happen to be .	-1
I paid $ .99 dr this app and I feel like it was n't worth it . The graphics are poor . I could n't figure out if I even had any ladders let alone how to place them . I would have spent the time to figure it out except that when I tried to view the map , I could n't scroll around without it moving uncontrollably like another reviewer stated . Going to uninstall . Should have tried the free version first . Running on HTC Amaze ( ics ) .	-1
beware . this game has 'read phone identity ' permission which means that it transfers your phone number and more to the game developers . DO N'T INSTALL AND REVIEW WITH ONE STAR . You can review if you download butnot installed . do n't run this app .	-1
this game wont let me buy stuff @ that little store and that guy wo n't walk or it wo n't use its item it is also just boaring the only up side is it was free	-1
Easily one of the worst games I 've encountered . Slow , boring , pointless and not all that intuitive . Uninstalled in a few minutes . Not worth anyone 's time .	-1
This was n't near as fun as I was hoping for . Maybe it was just not understanding it but it was just ok to me .	-1
Gem miner is a game with no fun , creativite , or anything at all . Never get this game at all . ( period )	-1
I 'm glad this app was free . Without instructions , I was not able to really figure out what I was supposed to be doing . I think if I had played it long enough , I probably would have gotten the idea . ( Many games I have downloaded fail to have instructions ... a big pet peeve of mine ! ! ) The picture quality was fuzzy on my Kindle Fire HD , so ultimately I ended up deleting this game .	-1
Wow.If you are like me you probably get an app that has a few bad reviews and ends up liking it . I did that with this app and I got stuck on the first level . Bad controls ; freezes ; and has no point ! Please take my word ; but if you do n't I understand . And please do n't say I am a jerk for saying this but ; This app is horrible !	-1
If you are looking to add text to your photos this is not the app for you . It adds & quot ; titles & quot ; , with very limited fonts that look very much alike . It 's difficult to figure out and does n't have self explanatory buttons . Trying to find a & quot ; save & quot ; button is an exercise in futility . It would n't be a good deal if it was free , and four dollars is certainly too much .	-1
I am unable to really evaluate this app . It was located in the apps for the Kindle Fire HD so I assumed it would show up on my device even though it indicated as an android app , but it 's never turned up .	-1
Did not work . Created is on leave . Web page error - no page found . Blog site has no help , seems to blame everyone but himself . Again , did not work . Web page for files not found by browsers . Blog help site has no help . Blames others not himself . On leave .	-1
I was hoping this app would provide an interface similar to using windows explorer over a USB cable ( albeit using a browser and wifi ) . Unfortunately there is no way to autodiscover the phone , so you have to enter the ip address and port in the browser . Then the program claims the ability to upload entire directories , which I was interested since I listen to a lot of audiobooks that are in their own directory . It turns out you have to zip the directory , upload it and unzip it on the phone . that 's still too awkward . For now I 'll stick to using a cable , it 's 1000 % more convenient than dealing wih the limitation of the interface over a browser for the sake of being wireless .	-1
installs ok , but does not work , menus do nothing just spin around then stop . menu key also . does not open anything	-1
I was all excited to use this up and coming competitor to Evernote . The built in task integration was a very desirable feature.However , when it comes to entering notes in the application , particularly on a tablet ( I have a Transformer with the keyboard ) the user experience is fair to poor . Which is much less than what ever note offers . It 's bad enough that the integrated tasking feature wo n't pull me over.Improve the editor ( and add spel checking ) and SpringPad would be a better app than evernote.Since I wo n't be using this app it puts it at a baseline and max of 3 stars , and -1 star for the bad editor .	-1
Sringpad is a great app , you can store just about anything hou want all in one place . The best part is you cango to their web site on your PC and have access to all of your data , add stuff and have accessto your additions onyou device .	-1
I did n't like the intrusiveness of the website . I do n't wish to share my grocery list or any of my other lists that I wish to build . I was looking for capturing information on a science project and I thought this would work for me . It did n't seem to be the case . Maybe I will find something else .	-1
I thought i would be able to put my existing recipes & info on this but so far I have n't been able to . Perhaps I 'm doing something wrong , I 'm not real tech savvy . I did find some recipes that I downloaded & someone else shared that they also liked that recipe.I not sure I like that some one else can see what I have on this app , so probably wo n't use it much .	-1
I downloaded the application with the hope of getting all my stuff organized . Everything was going very good , although it was a little difficult to group things as I wanted.I could n't find a menu to the application after opening it - first red flag . After savings a note I could n't change the folder I wanted the note to be in - second red flag.The application called for an update . After doing that I decided to find out what improvements the programmer had made . I opened the application and found out that EVERYTHING was GONE , and I mean everything.I was now looking at a completely empty application void of all that I had previously entered . Then I remembered , while installing the application I did not get a message telling me that all previous information would be preserved.Nice going programmers , maybe its my phone , a DROIDX 2 , maybe not . Still I have nothing that I saved.If the application sounds to good to be true , synchronizing with everything on your phone , it is to good . Simplicity often is better .	-1
I found spring pad to be kind of boring . I do think it could be helpful for some people but it does not seem very interesting , kind of boring app . Definately worth a chance though .	-1
I loved this app ! until I wrote a portion of a book I wanted to write and it was saved then the next time I opened the app , the whole thing was gone !	-1
I found it confusing . Insufficient information to guide you in setting it up . I already have Evernote & I like it . Spring pad did not work for me .	-1
Got this via Google Android Market.I went to the app 's website at springpadit.com , and when I signed in I was presented with a blank page . Without JavaScript , there is NO valid standards-compliant HTML anywhere to be found . Is it laziness , stupidity , or incompetence ? Who knows . I did send a POLITE email to them , but unsurprisingly I never heard from them.This company does n't seem to care about usability , standards , or its customers . Uninstalled , never to return . I 'll use Evernote instead .	-1
This app does n't do any more than the Kindle Fire HD already does on its own . I really wanted it to let me dim the light for reading in the dark . The Kindle Fire HD is a tool I use daily . I love to read in bed and the Kindle just does n't dim enough on its own . This app really wo n't dim enough to get the job done . I deleted it . Useless on the Kindle .	-1
maybe it is different on different devices , but on the kindle fire hd , I can already set the brightness to 5 % , so this app only adds pre-set settings , which is probably only marginally helpful.I ended up using the free screenDim app , and then purchasing the full version , because it allows for wider control of the brightness settings , as well as modifying the contrast , which allows for even better light controls when in really dark environments .	-1
I could never make it make a difference . I deleted it . It is much easier to use the setting that comes with my Kindle .	-1
Just another app abandoned here in the Appstore ... Two updates have been put out on Android Market for this since I downloaded it ; still nothing here in the Appstore ... I really like the app , but there 's no way I could recommend it if the developer is n't committed to ALL of their customers .	-1
this app was fun for the first few minutes , but got boring quickly . not to mention it took up HUGE space ! i played for about 10minutes , trying to give it a chance ... but was failed . not to mention it kept freezing up so you had to sit and wait for it to catch up with itself ... or shut off your phone & amp ; restart again . uninstalled the same day . great idea however ... just needs lots of work .	-1
unfortunately . this app has not worked on my Kindle Fire . The program crashes and I have to do a force close .	-1
I found it very confusing and hard to get involved with . I find other games better to play and enjoy .	-1
saving to sd card , recording my use , and many other things I just do n't know when I should do something or not	-1
If you have a Kindle Fire do not by this app ! ! ! It only works on things that have a camera ! ! ! and it does n't have a lot of options either	-1
It works fine and all , but whats the point ? DroidLight comes with the phone from day one . Do n't know why this would be a top download .	-1
This app is too big , ca n't place on SD , ( though it has permission to modify SD ) and requires too many permissions .	-1
I do n't get why you need Internet access to run a f-ing flashlight it does n't make any sense it is a flashlight for heavens sake	-1
Other than being a good program , unfortunately does not work with my current smartphone . It is supposed to act as a flashlight , but only seem to illuminate a red glow in the light , for a few seconds . Finally deleted the app . : - (	-1
this was a great flashlight app before they decided to update and remove the widget . one touch of widget and flashlight would come on , now it opens the app up and then turn on the flashlight . added a bunch of other flashlight options which is cool but widget was the best . bring it back !	-1
There is no reason for these apps to be able to turn on video and audio whenever they want forever . Also to have full Internet access - read-write to any part of your SD card and see all your contacts- This is getting out of hand , IMHO.Lawson4Congress2012 @ gmail.com	-1
Way too many permissions in new update . No way you need sd access or internet for a flashlight . Some words here .	-1
UPDATE : Knocked it down a couple of stars for the banner ad placement . It 's almost impossible to turn off the app without accidentally clicking a banner ad . Bad . Dumb marketers will never learn . It 's outta here.ORIGINAL : getting a lotta usage from a night owl who works and moves through the house when family 's asleep . also doubles as a desklamp with just enough light for my laptop 's keyboard .	-1
I used this to try to make folders for categories for books and it did not work . I probably have more to learn , but the interface looked blurry and terrible so I uninstalled it .	-1
Using this one for one minute was enough to tell me I did n't need it . It has the basics and that is all . Skip this one . HTC Inspire	-1
Beware ! I installed this app and my security app indicated that spyware is attached . I immediately uninstalled . Make sure to security scan if u do download	-1
It is just as easy to use any other app for light from my Kindle I have found it totally useless .	-1
its not worth it it aint that bright so why get it all the people who like it must have street lights or somethin im out livin in the country with no street lights or neighbors	-1
Never got to use it . First time , my tablet started acting up . Has a Trojan Horse per McAfee , dumped it ASAP .	-1
It lights up the flashlight , and the screen , maybe that 's useful if you want to be found but not for using your phone as flashlight , you 'll light up the path and your eyeballs at the same time . And all the access it wants to your phone info makes no sense .	-1
As an app for the Kindle , not very effective but then again the Kindle does n't have an auxillary light to be of any use . Do n't bother with it or any other . Great for a phone , not so good for the Kindle .	-1
you should not buy this app ! it does n't need to go into uneeded files and all it does is light up you 're screen . you can do that with your device without taking time to download an app !	-1
I got rid of this app because I could only get the usage agreement to come up . Probably my ineptitude but thelite on my phone was a one touch operation .	-1
I down loaded this app before I looked at the reveiws , but amidietly after I saw the reviews I uninstalled it do u think my kindle is still safe ?	-1
I deleted this as it was not what I thought it was going to be - Not for me.Not for me .	-1
This app did not work from the very start . Downloaded it for my granddaughter to play , and it just kept freezing up or stopping . She never got past the first screen . Tried several times before giving up and just deleting it .	-1
who would ever mix the things that should n't b mixed , fashion and *ughh* math . lets c , U GUYS ! THIS APP SUKS ! BAD IDEA ! . helloooo , duhh !	-1
I had to uninstall this app . It worked well but drained the battery QUICKLY . Does a good job otherwise . Droid X .	-1
This un needed app requires more permissions than any three other apps with no reasons given ! ! JUST SAY NO ! ! ! The standard sources for apps scan for malware before posting apps for.download .	-1
This program is great for keeping the crap you get associated with the internet.but I found one I like better and after several attempts I have been unable to uninstall this program . Could someone help me ?	-1
I have at least a dozen oceanhouse books and have never been disappointed , but this one was a total let down . I never even got to read it with my kids . Three times I tried and three times my phone froze and rebooted ! Granted I only tried `` read to me '' and not `` auto play '' or `` read to myself '' . I will uninstall on my phone and try it on my tablet .	-1
The game launches ok , but most of the 3d graphics are n't working at all.. Lots of weird artifacts , half the screen black , no players , etc .	-1
Asus transformer prime running 4.0.3 game was missing graphics and game was mostly black and graphics would pop 8n and out Please fix	-1
This game is nothing like the original Backbreaker football for the Xbox , so do n't be fooled by the title . There is only 2 different choices to play , which are almost exactly the same . This game gets very boring after about 10 minutes . This game also has terrible graphics and pretty bad rag doll-hit systems . Do not buy this app if your looking for the original Backbreaker .	-1
If you are massive football fan and you want to do the same game over and over just with the same thing , then this is the game for you . Because all you do is run the ball up the field and dodge the defense . That is the whole thing . So as I said , BORING ! !	-1
Worked shortly after I got it on my phone ( Samsung Epic ) . Got tired of it after a few days and uninstalled . Some weeks later I tried reinstalling , and now it does n't work . I can get into the game but the guy does n't run at all.NaturalMotion 's NFL Rivals also did n't work on either my phone or my Kindle Fire . They should publish a list of devices that are known to work with their apps ( but it might be embarrassingly short ) .	-1
The application loads fine and you can see the menus and evrything but once you start the game all you see is the bottom part of the screen that shows the total distance run and evrything else is black	-1
it takes an hour to install and all you do is wait for the cop to fall asleep and then you open the safe and tap . on the gold . so stupid !	-1
Id rather wipe with dry sand paper than dl this app . If garbage was an app , I would download that app 100 times before i 'd even think of letting this pile of diapers on my phone . Get a real job dev .	-1
this game is soooo stupid ! it does n't do anythingI would not download this app if I were you just saying	-1
This game sucks because I do n't know how to get gold.It also sucks because it is inposible to get the gold .	-1
I would of given this game zero stars waist of time you cant even move or do anyrhijg I deleeted it do n't get it	-1
this game is terrible . u do nothing . take my advice and do n't get this app . it 's just a wast of time . it stinks	-1
Man I thought this was going to be fun and its not I have been waiting for the app for like 10 minutes to download and all u do is wait to the Police officer to go to sleep then steal the gold borrrinnng	-1
this game honestly is the most boring game ive downloaded ... . I mean seriously the could have done something more with this.. I was expecting a fairly fun game but what I got was the exact opposite ...	-1
this is n't fun ATT ALL ... ..dumb boring..I do n't really know how to describe it ... except that it is n't fun ! ! ! ! ! : ( do n't try it	-1
It really does get boring after 3 minutes . Boys downloaded then quickly said , & # 34 ; you can uninstall it now & # 34 ; . That was the fastest lousy review in the our history download history !	-1
this is lamie i say its not worth downloading , i ussally love these kinds of games but this is not one of themPLEASE SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE AND DONT DOWNLOAD	-1
it sucks do not download omg had to give it . a star a. ll u do is . take gold su	-1
this game is the worst game ever . it almost gave my kindel fire a virus ! ! ! DO NOT GET THIS GAME ! ! ! WORST GAME IN THE WOOORLD ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! EVEN WORSE THEN DORA ! ! ! now that must be bad ...	-1
I would give this crap a negative five stars but I cant all tu do is touch the safe when the cop sleeps it terrable do n't get it	-1
ok so I thought this game was going to be fun so I was like cool but when I installed it it did n't even load so I had to get rid of it dumb game do n't get trust me	-1
I did not like thi game at all . It seems that children should be the only ones who should be playing this game .	-1
This game is horrible all you do is touch the screen . I mean what 's the point of that ? ! ? ! ? ! . . . . . .	-1
its dumb , the decripion says its more of a add viewing app then a game . all you do iswhen the guard falls asleep you touch the gold that 's it .	-1
I ca n't believe I downloaded this ! it 's a waste of space ! no wonder it was free . nothing good is ever free .	-1
It is horrid ! ! ! ! Do not get this app . I 'd rather sit and stare at a wall than play this game . I deleted it 30 seconds after I down loaded it .	-1
this game is horrible and boring there is a guard standing in front of a wall u wait for him to close his eyes then touch the safe and it gives u gold bars u have to get as many gold bars as possible but that 's it nothing else u just touch it horrible do n't buy	-1
... so it gets boring real fast . You 're just competing against yourself . Maybe good for young children , but even they 'll lose interest with all the other choices out there .	-1
this game is stupid.It will not let me do anything everywhere I touch it does n't do anything.Never get this app	-1
Test devices : Samsung Epic , Android 2.2 officialViewsonic gTablet , Brilliant Corners ( Android 2.2 ) Wordwrench is an app that solidly falls in the description of `` just another word jumble game . '' It 's appearance is a basic no frills approach , which has its pluses and minuses . It 's clean , and offers a few different color schemes , but there comes a point when clean = bland . That 's right where WordWrench falls in . About the best thing that can be said here is that WordWrench was good enough to reconfigure its layout when played on the tablet , so as to take advantage of the extra screen area ( screenshot uploaded ) . The sound effects are ok , quality recordings . No soundtrack here , nor even instructions . High scores are recorded only locally , and displayed on screen before one begins playing . As far as the gameplay , it 's as basic as one might expect . Select letters to spell words and try to get as many as possible before time runs out.At the end of the day , WordWrench fails to impress , and is easily lost among the many other almost exact duplicates floating around on Appstore and Market . With the exception being that almost all of the others are free and the devs want $ 2 for this one . I 'd suggest giving it a miss and picking up something nicer among the freebies .	-1
nice concept , but the dictionary is highly questionable . does not recognize a lot of basic words like 'zen ' which is in any modern English dictionary .	-1
Game is OK , but can not be moved to SD . With SD support it would be 4.5 star rating . $ 1.99 is steep , $ 0.99 would be good .	-1
nice but no sync to anything especially Google tasks ... nice but no sync to anything especially Google tasks ... la la	-1
Why should I pay for a non-syncing to do list when I can get a syncing to do list for free ?	-1
I LOVE to create TO DO LIST . I have been doing this for years on paper . So when AMAZON had this as their free app of the day I was so excited and downloaded it . I was disappointed to find it was confusing and not user friendly . It was also not at all what I thought a program for creating To Do list would be . Do n't waist your money there are free to do apps that are much better then this one . I have since deleted it off my Kindle .	-1
It 's very simple but I do n't see how it can be very useful . You can make a simple list , rename the list , cross it off but that 's about it . You can only make two lists . Imagine just the lists you have for the holidays . Gift list , guest list , shopping list , to do list etc . But with this app you have to choose just two.The description says there are powerful sort and search features , but I could n't find any . I think it would be more useful if you could make more lists .	-1
It WAS free and offered decent books for my little one . They were n't the best but she liked the stories read to her in the car . Today we went to choose one and they are all in Spanish except for 2 . We do n't speak Spanish . To get any English books I have to pay for them monthly ... not worth it especially since the stories were n't that great . Uninstalling	-1
My kids are bored with it . The stories are odd.. I think the creator was aiming for unique stories , and they are , but they do not keep my kids attention .	-1
I 'm sorry , I got a bad impression . The first story i read on this ridiculous app was about 4 animals who are friends , and one of them happens to be a deer . The deer is being pursued by a hunter ... a hunter who happens to look very mean and is wielding his gun in a violent manner , which is absurd and way over most kids ' heads . He traps the deer in a net , and call me ignorant , but I 've never heard of a hunter trapping a deer in that manner . That is over the top cruel and unrealistic . How is this even a pleasant story for a child to read ? I had no desire to read any of the other so-called stories after that . It reeked of someone pushing an agenda on fertile young minds , painting an American tradition such as hunting in such an exaggerated violent tone . Also , all of the illustrations are wierd and poorly done , and all of the characters have snide , sneering expressions on their faces , even Cinderella ! i 'm sure there are better story programs out there with a more talented illustrator I can download .	-1
I really wanted to get this for my granddaughter and was hoping I could put it on her Kindle . But it 's only Android . I loaded it onto my Nexus , but when we looked at the books , there was nothing that looked interesting .	-1
Every book had premium content which you had to purchase . It was taking a very long time to get actually books to review . Uninstalled an went with the FREE read-along books from Google Play . I thought that was much better and now every book is it 's own little icon in my library for the toddler .	-1
The books are good but it freezes up too often . My grandkids still like is so I will keep it but wish it was better .	-1
This game was good for my children , but I was bored when I played it . I was looking for a game like bounce out .	-1
Picked this out from previous reviews for a quick game to fill time while waiting for appointments . You need a bigger screen than the fire to enjoy this game . A pad would be a better viewing device . Unloaded game the next day .	-1
Need I say any more . For a 10 year old it may be fun , but for and adult who loves piano its and insult .	-1
I have no idea if this is fun considering it will not actually play on my Kindle Fire . It just keeps telling me the app cant run or something to that afect . It is setting in my cloud storage and will remain there . I really did not even want to give it a one star .	-1
I never understood how to use this app its not as good as color splash effect ! try some improvements please	-1
It sucks do n't get it I tried it and it wo n't even install its a shame I was really looking forward to it but if I could give this app zero stars I would ( ) ( ) ( - _ - ) _ _ Bunny !	-1
It would n't even start on the home page . It loaded for 7 minutes and then it did this freaking error page . I hate this and would not recommend to anyone .	-1
It is the worst app ever it does n't workIt does n't work at allI suggest that you 'll be better off getting a different appI HATE THIS APP ! ! ! ! : (	-1
You play a shallow Mexican stereotype , and you 're mission is to gun down unarmed , Americanesque pilgrims and steal their money . I 'm not one to shy away from violent video games or anything , but I 'm also not one to make a game out of killing unarmed innocent travelers .	-1
Got this for my Acer A500 tab and it did n't have any interesting news on it . Most of what was there was old news . So I uninstalled it . Not worth taking up memory ... .	-1
Have enjoyed eonline for many years , but uninstalled today thanks to their tasteless , partisan Obama Memes . Perhaps it did n't occur to them that people other than liberals might enjoy a little gossip on occasion . I wo n't be getting mine from E ! any longer . Do let me know if you all develop any class .	-1
I liked this ok but I hardly used it when I had my android and that 's why I rated it so low ... . Just because I did n't get a full use of it ... .	-1
The reason I am giving it one star is because it has only worked one time . When I click on the App icon the screen remains black and there is no news : (	-1
The kids found it hard to maneuver and get the shows they wanted to watch to play on the kindles .	-1
okay this might be a mistake i actully thought this was a great app to take anywhere but then i realize it baby shows you cant even se disney channel i was so lucky it aas free im so MAD it is a rip off ! ! ! ! !	-1
I love this game , but it makes me mad that I ca n't access the map because I need a more updated version of the game , which is n't this . I have no way of accessing the map and its slowing me down . If it does n't update soon on the Amazon App Store , I 'll be done with it .	-1
I was so addicted to this game but was immediately cut off when I saw the kindle fire version . its so broken ! please fix	-1
this app gave me the impression it would read epub files because my search showed this app when I searched epub reader for kindle fire . I guess I should have known better but id like a refund	-1
I want to be generous , considering that ezPDF can display and annotate files with any kind of image compression , which is so far unique on Android . Unfortunately , it is the sloppiest piece of software I have ever bought on any platform . I do not think it would have so high a rating as it does , had it not be the free app of the day earlier this year , and adopted by a lot of grateful and casual users who probably have n't touched it since.It is slow , and hangs and/or crashes with annoying frequency . Large files are usable , but barely . The file system is a complete annoyance . There is no option I can find that controls where files are stored ; without asking , it simply copies everything to its own folder , which is confusing , a huge waste of space , and a hindrance to syncing files back to a computer . If it is a hold-over from the iPad version , it is both lazy , and a mistake . Forget using an SD card . The controls are a mess : most things are done by tapping , but it is erratic and poorly implemented . Unintentional page-turning is a constant frustration . The soft-buttons meanwhile are illogically and inconsistently arranged , and tiny ; the new feature resizing them for tablets does not even work more than 40 % of the time . Adding new features is the only `` improvement '' that the developers seem interested in making . If you 're into aesthetics , the design is also ugly , and the menu text is incomprehensible jibberish.In fairness , updates are relatively frequent , but have so far done nothing to fix basic interface problems , or make the program more stable overall . Quite the opposite , really : does anyone really need to watch video embedded in PDF files on a phone or tablet ? I certainly would n't , unless I wanted to watch it in jittery slow-motion . I have reported all of this to directly the developer , and they never replied . If all you want to do is read 1-page documents and maybe add a signature , go for it . For anything more serious , do n't waste your time . It 's not capable enough to be an e-reader , especially not for students , lawyers , and the like .	-1
This reader is horribly slow . Acrobat works much better . Not sure about other features since I just read pdfs , but be prepared to wait ten seconds every time you turn the page .	-1
The functions work great , where I can edit my PDF documents , but interface has still much more to go . It 's really sluggish and slow when turning pages.There 's no undo function , so if I mistakenly draw something , it stays like that.The menu button has a conflict with kindle 's own dropdown tab when use in the landscape mode , thus I was not able to access the app menu button which was really frustrating .	-1
The menus in this game are a real eye strain due to the color choices . Couple that with a font that is too tiny , especially for a mobile screen and you have a menu that is almost unreadable . The in game messages use same font and color choices that I gave up playing the game quickly . No idea as to the quality of the game as a result . Too bad as game looks appealing .	-1
All it does is crash . I 've uninstalled and reinstalled it 3x with no results . Ca n't get past the putting the name in . Wasted my .99 cents . Shame since the test drive of it looked cool .	-1
I wish I could say this game was great , had I actually been able to install it , maybe I would . I paid for the game a few weeks ago and it has never been installed .. Droid 2 Global	-1
Would be a fun , though short , game , except it keeps crashing when it tries to load Level 3 . Having to ask for a refund .	-1
The app does not run on my android tablet . I tried more than 10 barcodes and the app never acknowledged any of them . It is also lacking in directions for use .	-1
When I originally got this app , it worked perfectly and checked all markets for prices . However , somehow Amazon now restricts this app to their own web site and you 're forced to sign in to Amazon before any price searches are completed . If you do n't sign in and try to `` skip '' the sign-in process , the app shuts down . I uninstalled the app and downloaded it from Google Play . That version works properly and now I can search all available markets for a product - without being troubled by a sign-in process .	-1
Downloaded this app , then saw the permissions it wanted at install . Forget that ! Way too much invasion of privacy ! Got rid of it right there . Makes me think of hackers and viruses that get into your e-mail and spread to all your contacts .	-1
Bummer was not comparable with my android device.Sorry Fcoldshower1 . When I get a new Kindle I 'll try again.Hopefully it will work a lot better .	-1
I 'm not really impressed with this app . I have found Scan Life to be much better and to be more useful .	-1
Much better ones out there as in Red Lazar . This one works only half the time . Do n't wast your time or money .	-1
I ca n't rate it - because it did n't work on my phone . I have the Samsung Impression SGH-A877 and wanted to try this app . But alas ; my phone is n't smart enough to understand how to use this app . No harm , no foul . Sounded good so I 'll keep looking for another that will work .	-1
Never could get this darn thing to work . Perhaps only useful on a smartphone and not a tablet . Only giving 1 star as it just will not recognize anything from a tablet which I think should have been in the description .	-1
loll lol lol lol lol . i wanted to get it but it wouldnt let me get it . i have a kindle fire hd it has a camera so why could n't i get it ?	-1
I could not get this to work with my cell phone . Tried numerous times , and I still do n't have a Barcode Scanner . I have a Razor 2 droid by Motorola , and it should be able to get it , but not so far .	-1
Pretty useless , uninstalled after 2 weeks . Was n't exactly sure it served any purpose , used it a few times but it was just okay	-1
It 's a rip off of WHERES MY DROID . Shameful . This app completely copies WHERES MY DROID which has been around much longer .	-1
They recently `` upgraded '' this software . Now you are limited to one device per e-mail account ; unless you have more than one e-mail address , you 'll have to pay an extra $ 4 a month . And features that used to be free , like location history , you 've got to pay for that now too.And once you `` upgrade '' your software , your old account is useless . Hope you do n't lose your phone before getting the new account setup ! It does n't work correctly with the Swype keyboard on my HTC Evo 3D.I installed it on my Motorola Xoom 4G and then tried to send an alarm to the tablet . It pops up with a screen that wants me to type in my e-mail address and password , but it wo n't let me actually type anything ! I had to reboot the tablet to clear the lock screen.While it found my tablet with scary precision , it thinks my phone is on the other side of the county ! It also took a considerable amount of time after sending the alarm command before it actually made any noise .	-1
my phone & apos ; s been bogged down since installing this app . i have been trying to but am unable to uninstall . isn & apos ; t that magical ? .	-1
I just bought the app and it seems good from the reviews but its completely useless at the moment cause the website is down . Seriously ? So if I lost my phone I would be screwed because it only depends on a website that may be down . Do n't waste your money not worth the risk .	-1
This is in no way a new phenomenon , but people clearly are throwing reason and time proven discernment out of the window.Trust is paramount here and for those who rank this highly , what criteria did you apply that made you trust this group ? Any system like this has always required due diligence on the 'buyers ' part ... the fact that this is on a tech gadget changes nothing . ( thus telling yourself or others that you are't smart enough to understand this high tech stuff is quite foolish ) . I say this for your own good ... but who I am really concerned about are children who could be endangered due to a lazy and careless parent.breaking it down to help:1 ) this type of system provides a third party with complete controlling of you device and data . ( the scope of data access varies ) 2 ) control in this case apparently includes destructive capabilities like wiping everything and locking the device3 ) any perceived 'ease ' of use for you , thus means ease of use for someone with access to the remote end of the account4 ) as correctly pointed out earlier , the access to said data and complete control is only protected by a very weak and super easily cracked systemas the subject says , this is clearly granting someone full , limitless access to what you perceive as valuable ... otherwise you would n't be heretrust must be earned folks , and there is a plethora of evidence to why this is so ... Google about security system scams and use those brains you have been given pleaseI also would advise folks to research what reformed cons give as advicethinkthink againthen wash , rinse , and repeatPLEASE	-1
How can you use the app if you ca n't even log on to the website ? If you have a good website it would be a good application . I love the idea , but see no reason for it if you ca n't wipe it remotely .	-1
When I opened this app It was great . I VIEWED and read about many birds . I even listened to birdsong . When I returned later I was not able to browse unless I registered . I will delete , I just want to browse .	-1
Sucks after latest update , During phone startup pop-up states Birds has stopped . Seriously , who needs this App at startup ? What a waste of resources !	-1
I want to like this app , really I do , but the publisher makes that very hard to do because of the clunky , non-user-friendly interface . It 's a nice app and I 'd use it a lot , except for the bad interface . For example , let 's say I 'm watching birds at my feeder and I see three new visitors that I want to make a sighting report for and add to my Life List . Okay , first I need to click the button for My Content , then the button for Sightings , then the + sign to make a sighting report . Great , the app lets me use the phone GPS to mark the spot on the map ! Oh , wait , the map is zoomed out to show half the state ... did they get it right ? ( try to zoom in manually ) Oh no ! As soon as I touched the screen to zoom in it changed the pin position ! Go back , start over , assume the position is correct and hit continue ... Oh great , now I have a list of 819 bird species to choose from , with no search function visible . Aha , there it is , under the options menu `` advanced search '' . `` Name search : scientific , alternate or common '' Oh , this should be easy ! Enter `` robin '' ... `` No matching results were found '' WTF ? ? Okay , how about `` mockingbird '' ... `` No matching results were found '' Okay , obviously that part does n't work , but I can still search using a lot of criteria , like habitat , regions , colors and size . Let 's try size ... `` About the size of a Robin '' ... FFFFFFUUUUUU ( $ 600 cell phone now needs replacement after impacting the bird feeder at high velocity )	-1
I can not get this app to open . I have removed it and reinstalled it only to have it to continue to force close . UUGGGHHHH	-1
HUGE red flag with update to 4.02 with all the newly required permissions that an app like this simply does not need unless the developers are up to no good . Everything mentioned below is suddenly needed in this latest version when it worked fine without them before.Why would a bird app all of a sudden need to know all the accounts on my device ? Why would a bird app need to view my WiFi connections and what devices are connected ? Why would a bird app need to close other apps on my device ? Why would a bird app need to run at start-up ? I do n't want my phone booting any slower because an unnecessary app has to run at boot.Why does a bird app need to know precisely where I am ? Uninstalled it from both my devices once I saw these permissions .	-1
Not what I expected . Too hard for me to use .	-1
I keep losing app.I have to keep reloading app . Sometimes it works .app needs work for my kindle fire . Please fix , app looks good when it works .	-1
THIS APP IS HUGE . TAKING UP 22NVM OF SPACE ON THE DROID INCREDIBLE . IT TAKES FOREVER TO LOAD UP . VERY SLOW AND NEEDS TO BE CONNECTED TO WIFI TO UPLOAD EACH BIRD BEFORE YOU GO OUT IN THE FIELD . BE WARY WHEN DOWNLOADING IT . OTHER THAN THAT , IT COULD BE USEFUL BUT MAKE SURE YOU DO YOUR RESEARCH ON IT BEFORE USING IT .	-1
It had all been very nice , informative and useful , until I tried to report a sighting and when moving the map , my kindle fire froze and now I can not do anything to make it work again ! ! !	-1
This app does not support any of the grandslam tournaments . I have not tried it for scores from the lesses events . I deleted it after I discovered I could n't follow the French Open .	-1
..then it would behoove you to make the game awesome . This one is not even close to awesome . It 's very basic in pretty much every way . No sounds , betting amount set for you , so-so graphics , single hand play . If none if this matters to you , then by all means give it a try , you might like it . There are better Blackjack apps to be had though .	-1
Did n't enjoy after experiencing words with friends and word feud , this game is mediocre at best . Everyone ca n't use the same concept and rename it ... smh	-1
My friend has Wordsmith on her Kindle , but she plays it alone . The one I downloaded is for 2 to 4 players ... .I do n't want to do anything that requires being online to play . The program she has looks different , too . Perhaps it was an earlier version .	-1
Not that interesting to me . Not really fun toO play . Do n't like it at all . Did not get it	-1
This game is not recommended by me for a kindle , I really do not use it any longer and have removed it from my carousel	-1
really liked this game until today when I upgraded . new screen is terrible . letter tiles are smaller so you can see points underneath makes it very hard to pick out words on board .	-1
the opponents neglect the game.so u have to wait for nothing.and u cant end the game.and get a new opponent	-1
Problems I have with Wordsmith Free:1- The letter generator loves the letter H. Often , 1/4 of the letters in the grid are H.2- The grid often has four or more of the same letter in a column or row.3- Several times the grid has contained only consonants.4- The app would occasionally shutdown my Kindle Fire.The is now suiting down my Kindle Fire on the first word I submit .	-1
This is a Scrabble-like app . It 's an ad-free version too . Explain why it needs to track me everywhere I go then ? I do mean everywhere , as you have to allow it to start at boot . Why does it want to run ALL of the time , even if I 'm not playing ? You have to signup using your email address ... but you already gave it permission to see all of your accounts ( email , Facebook , GVoice , etc . ) and access to them whenever it wants , so why the front ? This is rediculous , and most users probably do n't even understand what they are giving access to , but will then blame Google if their info is stolen . You can keep this one Amazon .	-1
Games constantly get stuck.For example , if I am playing 6 simultaneous games with a friend , I 'll only see 3 on me , so I ask , `` do you see any games on you '' and she 'll say , no , all 6 are on you . That 's when I know it 's time to un/reinstall the app . Then I 'll see all 6 games on me.Today , January 25th , my friend and I have un/reinstalled this app a combined 6 times . After the last reinstall , I played all 6 games that were on me , and 3 of them got stuck on my friend after the very next play.Utterly ridiculous.I have since written to customer support asking for a refund because this has been happening since I have owned the app , and it is only getting worse ... not better.Also , the server constantly is not connecting . This is not just me and my phone because my other friends notice the same thing ... one on Kindle Fire , another on Motorola Droid X or II or something , and I 'm on a Motorola Droid as well . It does n't seem to be the device that 's the problem.No paid app should have such problems ; I 'd expect this out of a Beta version . I like scrabble type games , but these problems with Wordsmith have not only zapped the fun , but actually frustrated the hell out of my friends and I.I hope all of you pay more attention and notice the same thing ; and I further hope many of these 5 and 4 star reviews will change to 1 and 2 stars so the developers will actually take notice and do something about it.Regards	-1
it 's a word game . I need an account . Not worth the trouble . Maybe they will fix that . Stupid 25 word minimum . Stupid 25 word minimum . Stupid 25 word minimum . Stupid 25 word minimum .	-1
This is yet one more application that requires way to much access to your phone and information . What 's with these applications and their invasive ways ... .. they say there 's nothing free in this world !	-1
Got it free because I was going up north . Well you ca n't do ANYTHING without data . Free was still a ripoff ! I even created a game before loosing access to the internet . But every single move NEEDS internet . I could n't even end the game , you guessed it - because I had no internet connection ... . Should be an 'offline mode ' or something .	-1
Why does this game need to know where I am ? Why does the company want to know where I am ? Avoid this if you understand the risks of this software. ( Wow ... 0 of 5 helpful votes ... do people really like spyware on their devices that much ? Or do they just not understand the risk and are mad because I exposed their fun game for its evil purposes and a prospective game playmate decided not to install spyware on their phone or tablet ? Chime it , I want to know ! )	-1
do n't buy this app . it stinks . its a cheap knockoff of words with friends . do n't be fooled . thanks for nothing wordsmith	-1
It wants direct access to your address book and the internet , with no described features that would need either.I ca n't know if this app is malicious , but it 's certainly acting the part .	-1
An application that fakes crappy old cameras on my modern phone ( rolleyes ) . Maybe hipsters would want this , but then again , hipsters would have an iphone.Would rather rub dirt mixed with vaseline on my camera lens than use this .	-1
There is no legitimate reason for this application to have access to your contact information EXCEPT when you EXPLICITLY instruct it to send , post or share pictures with your contacts . This is the same as you leaving your house door unlocked 24/7 for the possibility you may want someone to visit you some day . Proper app dev methodology should follow 'least priviledge ' practices . Too many developers are creating their apps to request access rights to everything , whether the app needs it to function or not . Either they 're lazy , unprofessional , incompetent , or leaving the door open for later fraudulent acts ; pick at least one .	-1
WHY does a CAMERA app need Internet access AND READ MY CONTACT DATA ! ? ! ! ... .. BEWARE SPYWARE ! ! ! What 's with this app Amazon !	-1
Thought this app might be fun . The view finder on the retro cameras is a joke . I could n't see what was in frame . Then it said my photos were in my retro camera gallery . This is separate from my regular gallery and apparently nowhere to be found on the device . Uninstalled .	-1
I was really happy when it came out . I love animals . I was very disappointed . I want my money back .	-1
I got this as the free app of the day because someone was complaining about how they paid 9 dollars for this and figured that it might irritate them if they saw i got it for free	-1
When you add a siting it does not share you can not know if others are seeing this wild life in the city area I was hoping it would share collected info . No such luck . It is however a field journal for your experience . If your just wanting animal pics and info for your kid this app will do that but it 's nothing you ca n't find online free ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
Like seriously this is not worth $ 0.99 buy rather it should be free download instead . Soon there will be a clock app coming up . Get it for free now while you can . Other than that , you 're wasting money and phone space .	-1
If you check your car , I bet it has one too . Mind you , the app itself is a clever example of what you can do with Android , but it 's just a gimmick in the end . File it with your fart apps . Hopefully we 'll get offered something useful for free tomorrow .	-1
but it does seem awfully big court what it does . As far as the price , well no one is forcing anytime to pay for it . To me the dude is more baffling than the cost .	-1
I have a speedometer in my car already , worthless app . And is it just me or are the 5 start ratings written by the developer ? No one reviews an app saying those things	-1
Slightly better than Amazons other App Fail this week . This works , but is large & amp ; cumbersome compared to other apps doing the same . Not fast enough for foot , on bike or car I also want maps & amp ; compass - does n't have them . Not skinnable for day/night , much less ANY other background . Would guess most of the memory req is for the fake leather , which should be external to the app . AFAIK , Amazon gives devs like this part of the normal purchase price when they give it away , so we will probably see more garbage like this popping up to try & amp ; win the lottery .	-1
No offense to the dev , since I do definitely like the simplicity , but it seems almost outrageous to charge for an app that does only one thing : calculates speed based on GPS data and display it in different units.At least make it show the speed with direction or something ... although I would definitely prefer more features for a paid app . Perhaps store the speed and coordinate data so the user can see his or her average speed and path on a map ? Or maybe an element that tells you if you 're speeding ? Or even just different potential themes ? Seriously though , for a paid app , this is saddening and far too limited . If I 'm going to leave my phone screen on for something , it 's not going to be to just view my speed .	-1
The instructions on the games were n't clear , so I failed everything and solved nothing .. bummed ... Great concept though ... keep trying .	-1
Boreing not fun at all it is very confussing to know how to play it not enlighten insttusion not fungi going even for me	-1
no way this did n't help me it made me confused si do n't get it if you get it will be a rip off	-1
This game seems to be one that challenges the brain when you view the APP . Ultimately , it is boring , boring , boring . So boring I removed it from my device .	-1
This was for my child but they lost interest very fast , i guess at there age they want games , i wish this could be more engaging	-1
Each level is repetetive and does n't add anything new or challenge you beyond what you learned in level one , just a bit harder .	-1
It was not as helpful as I would liked it to be . I used it everyday for over a month and saw no difference in my memory .	-1
While I appreciate the effort and I would like an app like this to use , I , too , do not understand why an app like this wants my location data . Unless author removes that or explains it , I have to pass and encourage others to pass on it , too . If location is so that he can pass that data to advertisers , that is even more scary . No thanks .	-1
Still have horoscope of 2012 , despite we are already in 2013 . The icon do not show in the kindle fire . Its just a square grey area . Annoying .	-1
I do not even remember downloading this game , so I assume it was not very good . Some of the downloads I got from Amazon , just did n't work well with my phone . But I just do n't remember this one .	-1
What good is an app if it wo n't install ? Droid X. Wasted a lot of time trying to get it downloaded and installed . Decided to wait a day and try again , and the stupid game is n't in my saved list.Mangled Finger is on my Do Not Download List .	-1
I like pinball . I especially like video game pinball . My office has an arcade-style multi-game cabinet which includes the classic & quot ; Pinball Action & quot ; ; I & apos ; ve swept the high score list . Not being a man , I will never be a & quot ; Ladies Man & quot ; , and I prefer my games without cheesy pick-up lines , so I will hold out for an unbiased pinball game . There & apos ; s no excuse for this in this day and age .	-1
the game won & apos ; t start . it just comes up and says loading . oh well , it & apos ; s just a goofy pinball game anyway how fun could it be ?	-1
1st off.. music is very annoying . You will need to mute it . Game play is ok . The table will get boring after awhile . I played this for about an hour and I & apos ; m going to uninstall it . You might enjoy this more than I did , but for me this game is a pass .	-1
I bought this today . and downloaded it to my fire . It looked like a pretty good app . Well I thought that these apps were supposed to be tested for working on a fire I guess not . I have tried to play it atleast 20 times now and have yet to be able to . finish a game . It either freezes up or just stops and goes back to my home page . Save yourself 99cents and wasting you time	-1
I played this game for a half an hour . I scored well over 20 million several times . Got numerous achievements ... so when do I get to the next level in story mode ? I keep playing the same boring first level over and over and over ... Because of this lame pinball game , it gets a 2 . How and what do you have to do to get to the next level ? Very frustrating . Will delete immediately .	-1
I downloaded this and it just does n't play on my son 's Kindle ... I am disappointed for that reason . It might be good otherwise .	-1
its really bad . I do n't like it because I just need to know where the States go and it just tells things about the state .	-1
I never used it so do n't know if we actually like it or enjoy it . Got it b/c child was learning States .	-1
Had to uninstall . Would not scroll , so only the beginning letter A countries showed . Also opened in upside down landscape mode . I have a Kindle Fire . No stars from me	-1
hi , really not a fan of this app . there are so many alternatives out there and the price for this one is way too steep . not intuitive . lower the price and fix some of the flaws	-1
This is free on google play . Not sure why it costs money here . Free app of the day , not impressed .	-1
Makes sense spend a lot of money for an Internet ready device then load it with stale data . One star please	-1
Seriously ? You expect me to believe a book of facts , needs access to these 3 permissions on my device . I might as well just run to the Internet and post all of my personal information for the world to see . So let 's look at them . Full Internet Access ? I could n't honestly tell you why they are requesting this permission , because when it cad came time to install , well I said & quot ; Nope & quot ; ! But nothing in the app 's description mentions anything about needing Internet Access , so there is strike 1 ! Next we have Read Phone State and Identity ? So a book full of facts needs to know my phone or tablet 's ID number , needs to know when I make phone calls and needs to know who I am calling ? Haha ! And again , not mentioned in the description , but I would n't buy it anyways , so strike 2 ! And last but not least on the list of suspect , most likely data mining permissions , we have Fine GPS Location . So a book of facts not only needs to know my general location when I 'm reading facts , but it needs to pinpoint my location exactly ? And once again , absolutely can not see how this permission pertains to reading facts ? So strike 3 ! And you 're out ! Anyone who cares the least bit about their privacy and keeping their personal information , personal . Well you 'd do real good to steer clear of this malware !	-1
Ok so I am so obsessed with scrabble I downloaded this game so I could have more than 21 games going , I could have 50 . However , the server does n't work have the time and it is just blah , the scoring is weird and there are a bunch of perverts on there ( YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED )	-1
when I tried downloaded it said & quot ; corrupted . not able to install & quot ; which is totally not fair . one star because it wing let me download : (	-1
Look , take a clue from Angry Birds FREE ... . just open network sockets , that 's all it wants . You have thumbnails you want to retrieve of apps people are using ( so this info can be sold ) , you want to know where the live ... . come on , if you want to go into the advertising business to promote products for people , go become an ad-man for a marketing company , and stop pimping yourselves as developers by becoming pawns ( disguised as developers ) to peddle ad garbage .	-1
I often have to shut down and restart my kindle quite often while playing with this app . Other than that it is ok .	-1
Difficult to use .	-1
Better multiplayer options would be nice . more game variants , like fox and geese , would be nice too . overall a fun and quality free app of the day .	-1
i deleted the app once i found it very forgettable ... does n't stand the test of time like other great apps . looking for more .	-1
Not fun confusing	-1
Not easy to play on the Kindle . Too small to be fun and thus just not enjoyable . It 's not as easy as planning on your computer .	-1
Other reviewers mentioned this , and I should have listened ! The cards are about a quarter of an inch square , on my Kindle Fire HDX . There 's no need for this , because there is lots of empty space all around and between them . There was an option for & # 34 ; large card art & # 34 ; versus & # 34 ; normal card art & # 34 ; , but this did n't help.Uninstalled .	-1
Do n't like I do n't know how to play chess so I really did not understand how to play the game	-1
I have no idea what this thing is or why or how I got it so that is my review	-1
Ca n't figure out how the app is supposed to work . The kindle does n't read as cards . How the check are you supposed to download	-1
I do n't even know how to use this . Could n't remember what I was suppose to do with it or even why I downloaded it .	-1
I did not do what I thought it would do . I did not perform as advertised , even though it was free .	-1
does not work ! out of all the apps i tried non of them would open . : ( made sure it was an Apk . file too ... : ( i do n't recomend	-1
I have a Kindle Fire HD and I want to get instagram , but when I click on instagram it asks for silk or Appstore . I ca n't download it .	-1
I ordered this as I did my other kindle items and have not received The Cat in The Hat . Have n't received & # 34 ; Bad Piggies & # 34 ; kindle game either .	-1
this app is not my favorite but for a younger person or someone that really enjoys the lorax this app would be amazing	-1
I was really bummed when I actually sprung and paid for this app ... such a disappointment . The narrator 's voice is borderline scary , the interactive feature is minimal compared to others . Not happy with this one at all .	-1
it is not good and not good for all kids ! and I would n't recommend it to get.p.s NOT GOOD AT ALL .	-1
Want to know nearly everything about a particular country . Than this CIA World FactBook is for you . You 'll suffer from information overload after reading about the first country ( all listed in alphabetical order for easy access ) . Update : The app just did an automatic update on its own and now all the countries listed are empty of information . What the hell ? ! ? This is no way to treat a customer !	-1
Tried it and it did not work , Not sure why , I uninstalled and installed it a couple of times but no luck	-1
its useable but kind of clunky and hard to navigate through . the priority slide is a good idea in theory but in execution ... I 'm not willing to spend an extra 20 minutes detailing each of my daily chores . ill just stick with Out of Milk : ) way more User friendly and has lots of items already in its own memory .	-1
Pressed save button over and over and when I would return to the list it was n't saved . Pantech Breakout phone .	-1
The UI needs major improvements . To many steps to create a list such as inventory . Main screen says to click menu for info . on how to use . only problem is , there is no menu button displayed ( Motorola Xoom ) . Would never pay for this and i 'm uninstalling even though it was the FAOTD .	-1
SAD TO SAY I must update my otherwise favorable review of this app . IT NEEDS AN EXIT BUTTON . I find it HIGHLY ANNOYING and somewhat suspicious when an app doesnt provide that simple feature . Understand , I now find I wont even use the app because I WILL NOT be forced to take the time for all the extra steps it takes to go to my phones Settings , then to Apps / Manage Apps , scrolllllllll allllll the way down to find THIS app in the list , click on it , and then scroll to the Force Close button , click that , and exit out of that and then out of my Settings and close the folder I house them in . Really ... should I have to go through THAT every time I want to access , lets say , my grocery list just to add one stinkin bunch of bananas ? ? All apps should have EXIT BUTTONS . Why ? ? If all apps felt they were the exception to this courtesy , theyd all `` not be running/open , '' but theyd all collectively be using the internal memory of which they have no business using if I want to CLOSE THE APP BECAUSE I AM THROUGH WITH IT UNTIL THE NEXT TIME I WANT TO USE IT . I emailed the developer about this , first mentioning that there is no Exit button , and asked why I needed to Force Close it through Settings . His prompt reply was to educate me on the android platform , making no mention of the Exit Button part of my email ( so I assume theyre not working on adding one anytime soon ) , and basically blamed it on android by telling me `` thats how android works '' so that you can go back to an app using the Recent Apps menu button . He made NO mention that should I choose to go back to the app even after using an exit button , it would still be listed there and just reopen in one second.IMO , a standalone , non-syncing app such as a simple list maker NEEDS AN EXIT BUTTON . Let ME decide whether I want to `` back out of it '' and keep that small amount of memory going or CLOSE IT COMPLETELY AND FULLY . I shouldnt have to rely on a third-party app to control such nonsense from apps whose developers wont provide you with the common courtesy of a simple , lousy EXIT BUTTON.NOW ... ..A word about permissions here . YES , the developer COULD have had the phone permission thing there because he wanted his app to pause while a phone call came through , but in the app world , that `` one permission '' he needed is just not available to developers ( yet ? ) . It only comes as a `` bundle pack . '' Even when there 's no apparent need for the Phone State and Identity permission on an app , many apps request it when you install it . What that ALLOWS is for advertisers like Google to spy on you . Phone State and Identity is n't `` one permission '' it 's a whole BUNCH of permissions bundled together . It allows the app to see if you 're on a phone call , read your phone number , your phone 's IMEI number , the IMSI number of your sim card , and the device ID assiged to your phone ( unique only to YOU ) . Let 's review ... .If you 're on a phone call ? Ok , we can live with that so that your phone can like tell the media player to pause the music until you hang up from the call . Yeah , that 's AN INNOCENT PERMISSION . The media player should keep quiet while I 'm on the phone ... but it does n't need to know my PHONE NUMBER ! IMEI , the IMSI , and the unique ID seems innocent , but they 're not . That unique ID is the brass ring to all spammers and advertisers . These numbers can track you , and they 're not like `` cookies '' on the web brower that you just opt out of . You can delete a cookie , but that device ID is permanently tied to your phone . The IMSI identifies your sim card and you ca n't change that , and changing the IMEI is just plain illegal in lots of countries . Now you throw those ingredients together with the permission to GO ONLINE ( and that 's ONLY going to come from `` FULL INTERNET PERMISSION . `` , and that 's a disaster recipe and the potential for abuse is just LIMITLESS . The phone permission thing is not SPLIT . That phone `` state '' permission should n't be in a bundle pack with permission to read your PHONE IDENTITY . And that phone identity permission should be tuned , too , like permission to read your phone NUMBER should be separate from the other permissions . Unfortunately , there 's just no way to split it yet . They should allow granting phone state permission but deny access to phone IDENTITY ... . or even better , feed BOGUS identity information to the nosy apps.NOW , OTHER permissions a phone has in conjunction with this one may be a `` sinister bundle '' with the intent to be nosy and grab your info for subsidiary purposes , but I 'm not the developer and ca n't comment on what the developer 's intentions are because of the android phone permissions bundle dilemma .	-1
I just discovered , after years of having and using this app that it automatically sends your usage data to flurry analytics ! Minus two for that . I want a basic list app , just item name and done , but this seems to want extra settings for each item . Would n't recommend . Too Shady . If they auto enroll me after an update , I 'll downgrade to one star , we 'll see .	-1
Be very careful with this ; I downloaded it as a free app of the day , had it for a few days and had to delete from my Kindle ... .malware ! !	-1
this game is fun but the free version has more . The paid version only has a few blades to get . the free version can do everything that the paid version can do and it has more blades . DO NOT PAY FOR THIS , GET THE FREE VERSION ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
I really thought this game would be more interesting , but it just does n't hold my attention . I play for maybe 5 minutes and then I 'm trying to find something more else to do . It 's probably more along the lines of a children 's game , getting them to learn hand eye coordination . I Would n't recommend .	-1
I purchased this app back in August after having had the free version for about a month . Well , that was a mistake . The ads were never a problem for me . I wanted a smoother game play & more features which are usually the norm when `` upgrading '' from a free version . I noticed a lag immediately during the first game . An issue I never had with the free version . I swallowed my pride & left it on my sd card ( class 10 ) hoping an update would eventually resolve all issues . Then I saw today that this app has n't had an update in forever . I 'll never get an app from Halfbrick again as they seem to forget about their old apps altogether in favor of newer ones .	-1
I have played it several times . It is not my favorite but have done it frequently . My grandson liked it because it was Ninja and was able to whack the fruit..	-1
this game just is no different from the free version ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! v gb hxhht dre dtddtg dtyduydyfg dfydtd d f g h j	-1
Ok guys , if you do n't want it just do n't buy it , and there 's a Refund Policy so go get your refund and do n't just hate the game just because the priced version stinks . So go play the free version and do n't hate this studio just because of this one game . : )	-1
I thought o would like this game , but I do n't play it at all . It 's not like it 's bad or anything , i 'm just never interested	-1
Play store has an update that removes camera/contacts permissions and other fixes along with adding a new fruit ( pomegranate ) ... . why is it not updated here yet ?	-1
the free app is WWWWAAAAYYYY better than a stupid 99 & cent ; app ... it is the same app but free ... DONT EVER GET THIS APP ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
Excessive permissions ! Basically , with the given permission , the developers CAN data-mine the users ' app usage ( when , what , and roughly where ( using wifi ) ) and create an all-day ads campaign for each users .	-1
Game us fun and very well executed.Main issue is that the iPhone and free android version have a newer version number with more unlockables ... And really , adding the challenges of the unlockables and feint achievements is what keeps repetitively slicing fruit enjoyable.Its not a technical issue , since the free version has more functionality.The ads are noticable in the free version , but I 've seen worse ( free angry birds ads can affect game play ) . Why does the paid app have less stuff ? ? ?	-1
The update killed this game with unexplained , intrusive permissions and ads for a paid app . This update is not available on Google Play ( Market )	-1
This is one of the first free games I downloaded . My 8 yr old Grandaughter told me to because she liked it . Really a kids game .	-1
Unfortunately , this game doesnt work on my HTC G2 . The swipes you have to make are not recognized a third of the time which totally breaks the game .	-1
this game is not particularly imaginative or deep . will pass time . it wo n't do much else . pass on this one .	-1
BORONG ! ! ! ! Boring slow stupid game ... SORRY for those who think its fun . Blah , blah , blah . I much rather watch t.v and I hate t.v ! ! !	-1
this app is aweful . The planes move too slowly , enemy islands make plains at least five times faster , giving them an extreme advantage . this game is not worth one cent .	-1
This is a very fun game and I would keep it for awhile if it could be installed to SD .	-1
responds very slowly to touch . units seem to have a lower maximum amount than computer units . more islands might make this better . droid2	-1
It really does n't matter how great or horrible an app is if you ca n't run it . Having the option to move the app to an SD card should be mandatory .	-1
This item is very blah quality as well as just game play in general . Stay away and not worth the money .	-1
It does n't save the campaign score . Have to constantly restart the game . Very very very annoying . Nexus s cm 7	-1
Do n't get your hopes up . It just makes up a percentage . Example : it makes up 63 % . It 's not real . I did it with my dad it said something low , but I really love my family 100,000,000,000,000 , %	-1
what if some one was in love with somebody and did this app and it said your not a good match obviously . that is n't true it is fake but this app should be FREE !	-1
Like they 're actually scanning your finger . Sure.First of all , how can they tell whether you guys are perfect together . By how your skin is the same temperature ? I do n't think so.Definitely not worth 99 cents . Complete waste of time and money , do n't think it 's worth anything.Proof : I tried it with my boyfriend and it said 29 % . We 've been dating for three years . Am I crazy , or is this thing a piece of crap ?	-1
My daughter loves it , but seriously it 's for kids . She enjoys it very much . So , once again , parents it 's fun if you 're a kid	-1
its not very good . most of the sounds are dumb and sound like they were made years ago . I advise you not to waste space with this app .	-1
Terrible sound effects and so few of them make it totally not worth paying . Glad I got it as the free app of the day ! Even then it 's not worth the download ! ! !	-1
Quality of the sounds overall is not great . A few of the spoken sounds seem like they may be taken from movies or TV shows , which are not credited anywhere I could find . Possibly useful if you do n't know how to search for sounds to use for notifications ... maybe .	-1
this is so not worth the money there are way better apps out there do not get it ! ! it stinks	-1
Maybe good if you 're 4 years old . At least my test drive the sounds were poor & amp ; many just Inncurate it just stupid . Edge is a good app to find ringtones & amp ; notification tones of all kinds . And not surprisingly , another Google Play app showing its gotten a whopping 10+ downloads ...	-1
This appears to be a simple sound board . however its request to modify global settings ans read phone state do n't jibe with this use . While its free , I cant see permitting this level of control .	-1
I would not buy this app . There are not many sounds , and they are n't all that great . You can find much better sound effect apps with many more sounds for free that have the option like this one does , of setting the sound as notification also . Do n't waste the money , or since it 's free today do n't waste the time .	-1
All I see is 1 star ratings.How is this top free.It 's not free anymore either.I wonder how it got top free ...	-1
This game lets u win every time u play u win EVERY TIME ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! please save your time and just do n't get it	-1
never got to play it , it kept force closing . would give less than 1 star if I could . not worth the time it took to download it	-1
Does n't open on kindle fire do n't get this crap . Apparently . you need Quell and Angry Birds for this to work on Kiele fire . Quell is $ 0.99 and not sure about Angry Birds . They want your money . Do n't unless it is worth your money . BTW send error reports to amazon that 'll teach them ! ! !	-1
I tried and tried but it does not work on the kindle FIRE ! It keept force closing on me and it just wo n't work on the kindle fire . I would NOT recommend this app because of the force close .	-1
I cant open this app on my kindle . I say its dumb . Maybe an update will work but this is a dumb app .	-1
when I try to play the game the only option is force close ! how am I supposed to play the game if it does n't even let me	-1
Got this app the first night i got my kindle fire it has not worked ever ! Very disappointed.Would not recommend it to anyone .	-1
Was never able to get this to work on my kindle . A very frustrating experience at the least . Was looking forward to it too .	-1
It does n't allow correcting album artwork . If you delete the app and get another , you still ca n't correct artwork . Do n't waste time with it .	-1
unless you 're the cook ( or even the engineer ) on the star trek Enterprise the conversions in this app are useless ( and that 's when they even make sense ) . unless you are planning on gifting this app to your great-great- ( add several more greats ) -grandchild do n't waste your free money or time .	-1
I wonder just how useful converting Beef ( Cooked ) to lb/ft3 can be . Are we talking whole cows ? Found a better universal converter called Convertpad that does everything under the sun , including cooking measurements like tsp , grams , etc . Just keep scrolling , it 's there and it works .	-1
for those of us who do n't know the difference between an ounce and a pound . I am sure my kitchen will be a better place with this application . Now if I only had an application to show me how to open my refrigerator or oven .	-1
I was happy to see an app available instead of another game and a cooking app just in time for Thanksgiving was brilliant . Sadly the reviews about it not making sense are pretty accurate . For example & quot ; 1 beef = how many gallons ? & quot ; 1 beef could be 1 cup , 1 pound , 1 ton , etc . And 1 gallon ? Is that beef liquified ? This is just one example of many . I had such high hopes . It 's not all bad though , as there are a few tables that look good ( if accurate ) , and there look to be some good conversions . The app has potential , but needs some work . I 'll keep the app for a while , in the hopes that they fix it up . I will modify my review as needed and will contact them with my concerns . Maybe it could end up being a good app ?	-1
this is not a game and is very boring . the only people that would be the ding dongs that can not do math in their head . you would only use this app about once a year .	-1
Worked poorly . Tried for my friend 's daughter struggling in math . Froze up each attempt seconds into the & # 34 ; game & # 34 ; . Deleted in less than 5 mintues .	-1
This was too easy for me but for some it may be perfect . I did find that the screens changed to quickly .	-1
Sorry folks but this app does not even begin to cut it for me.Maybe my taste in music is just not current or & quot ; hip & quot ; enough . I 'm a good singer and whistler ... only about 1 out of 10 were recognized .	-1
The recent update to this app requires the ability to see which other apps are running . There is n't a reason this app should need that ability , so one can only assume it 's for spying on its users .	-1
This app sucks ! It never works for me or my partner . Save your money and get something else out that does work . This is not it .	-1
Downloaded it because it was free so I figured why not . Now I know why it 's free . Half the time the program can not name the song I am trying to get the title to . The other half of the time , it freezes . I wish I could say I was joking , but I 'm not.If you want to try a music ID program , try Shazam . It has n't frozen on me yet.1.8 / 5	-1
This calculater was not what I had needed . It did not suit my needs . : ( : ( : ( : ( : ( : (	-1
The lack of a decimal point on the Kindle Fire Keyboard , renders the app as sub standard . Had it been included , I would have rated this app 4 stars for it 's ease of use . As is though , it has limited functionality .	-1
The simple equations can be done with the stock calculator app . This app is not needed . What us 25 % of 30 ? 30*.25= your answer . What is 25 % more ? 30*1.25 . All options are similar . An investment in learning basic percent math would be much more worthwhile .	-1
Save your space and your money , learn how percents and decimals work . We surely do n't need an app for everything , let your brain get some exercise too .	-1
I am sure that 95 percent of people will enjoy this app . Not so sure about the other half of them .	-1
Oh you do n't understand how percents work ? Then this app is perfect for you . Why get a calculator that can do all math when you can get this one that only does one type of math ? Dumbest app ever .	-1
Come on developers ... pay attention to details before you throw an app on the market for gosh sakes . The popup menu to add a decimel to your number does not consistently pop up on this app . It pops up after entering a second value but come on guys , fix this up so you do n't look stupid or go back to developing games where details do n't matter as much .	-1
At today 's free & quot ; price & quot ; , this app is a waste of time , as you 'll not only have wasted time downloading and installing it , but you 'll also be wasting the time needed to uninstall it once you realize how useless it truly is . There is n't a single thing this app can do that anyone with half a brain could n't do with the phone's/tablet 's built-in calculator . For anyone who ca n't calculate such things with the calculator , they probably should n't be using a smartphone . Come tomorrow ( 4/13 , Friday the 13th ) , when this app returns to its regular $ 1 price , it will be an even bigger waste , as those purchasing it will have wasted their money ... and the developer will be laughing his way to the bank .	-1
This is to criticize the amazon appstore rather than the app itself . Version 5 came out today in the Play Store , and this is still stuck at version 3.0.6 ? So please consider this a warning that when you purchase the app through amazon , you will be paying the same price as in the Play Store but get a version that is 15 months old and does n't seem to see any updates at all !	-1
2013 update : When I purchased this , the price was n't six dollars . At this price , it 's a rip-off . Thus , my rating drops from five stars to one. -- -- -- -- - Original five star rating -- -- -- -- -- I purchased the infinity version because I loved the free one . I totally believe in supporting any business that puts out a decent produce and at a fair price . It also does a great job at finding songs you just ca n't seem to find the name of .	-1
Tried this one for less than one day before I decided to delete from my OS . Just not what I personally want or need .	-1
All of these 5 star reviews are really suspicious . This does what free apps do but h the free app does it better . It appears to me as if this app is a con , free just long enough to stack several fraudulent 5 star reviews in its favor then collect six dollars from people who base their app purchasing decisions on positive reviews . Notice also that many of the 5 star reviews resort to insults against honest reviewers who point out obvious problems with this app . Buyer beware - do n't waste your money . This app is n't even worth the space it takes on your device nor the time it takes to download .	-1
i dont understand a paid app with adds . and the cozi gold is 3bucks a month . with a bit of time to set up groups in googles natve stuff you can do everything this does .	-1
I used it on my kindle fire . Have to have internet to view my calendar . Which sucks being I 'm always on the go with 3 children and two on multi sports . It did n't sync with my last calendar so had to put all games in and could n't copy and paste .	-1
What does this do that Google services do n't ? No , really , this is redundant.If you 've downloaded this app it means you have an Android.If you have an Android , it means you have a Google account.If you have a Google account , it means you have access to Google Calendar , Tasks and Docs ( along with many other Google services . ) So basically , if you 've installed this app , it means you did n't need it.I was going to try this out to see if it was worth making the switch but I ca n't sync my Calendar , Tasks OR Gdoc lists with this.I already have native apps for my Google services ( which play nice with each other ) and their web app counterparts offer a much cleaner UI.If you 're going to try to compete with Google 's services , maybe you should n't do it on THEIR stomping grounds ( Android , ) they 've already got it covered .	-1
All in all this is a very nice app with a lot of functionality ( most of which I do n't even need ) although it is a bit cumbersome to use . I really only wanted a basic calendar for local non-syncing use on my kindle fire , but I chose it because it is the only app I could find that offers a biweekly repeat option . But the calendar will only display in week view on the free version and you have to upgrade to the & quot ; gold & quot ; version to get the monthly view . I would n't mind paying a one-time fee to upgrade , but asking for a monthly fee is ridiculous !	-1
I really want this app to work for me but when I try to sign up for it , it wo n't accept my email address . Before you reply to my post , I am using Kindle Fire and I am not trying to sign in , I am trying to sign up . Please help . Thanks . If I get to use the app , I might be able to give it a better rating . Looking forward to hearing from someone on this .	-1
OFGS ! I wish I could get back the time I spent trying to set this app up only to have it not function well on my kindle fire ! Uninstalled and my fingers hurt from trying to stab thru the screen . Aaaarrrrgggh ! Nice idea , did n't work ...	-1
Was a grocery list and calander solution for my husband and I . Unfortunately it started to randomly lose appointments and items . At first we just thought we were forgetting to enter them . So we started being extra careful about it , we realised it was the app somehow erasing the appointments . We have two boys with severe medical conditions and loosing these appointments was causing serious problems so we had to stop using cozi . It was a great app until that started .	-1
I really did not like this . I thought it a bit too intricate for my taste . I should delete it .	-1
Due to my rotating work schedule , I need a monthly view to have an overview of each week & amp ; month . A calendar app with no month view ? No thanks . Of course , if you want to pay a monthly fee , you get the & quot ; patent pending monthly view & quot ; feature . Uninstalled .	-1
I was hoping that this would tie in gmail calendar and task with other users . No dice . Right now my wife and I share our Google Calendars . works great . Just looking for that app that allows us to take it that next step . cozi is n't it .	-1
I got the `` Gold '' version during Amazon 's app of the day . Now it says i do n't have the gold version and the adds are so intrusive that I 'm going to discontinue use . I also just got a Kindle . I was hoping a larger and faster interface would help with the screen space . Sadly the app is impossible to use . All the drop down menus fail to work and half the time rotating the device causes the main menu down the left side to be covered up . Seems like poor software design . I 'll find something else. -- -Update -- -Adding one star for fixing the menu issues dealing with the Kindle . It is at least usable as of the last update ( last few days ) .	-1
You have to buy what you want or need to get an everyday use , and there are to many good apps out there that are FREE.NOT ...	-1
I do n't like this app it just did n't meet my needs for what I was wanting to do so I do n't like it much	-1
I thought this app would make my life easier but it is hard to navigate and does nothing that the calender app on my phone does n't already do ( just link your phones calender with google and you can link it with your family members ) . Easy enough .	-1
I can deal with the & quot ; beta & quot ; version . It does n't bother me that the UI is a little hard to navigate . But if I amm going to have to manually enter in all my specific brand names and items , the least the dev could do was give a barcode scanner that works . I tried it on multiple items ( and in both standard UPC mode as well as TAG mode just to make sure ) and NOTHING scanned . I know it is n't my phone because my other scanner works fine.Droid2	-1
this is a terrible app all around and the fact that the dev is trying to charge for it is sad . its incredibly buggy . much better free apps that do more and do it better	-1
Is a good idea but the app is to complicated for novice users . Bar code scanner did n't scan 9 out if 10 items scanned . It is much easier to just use notes to make a simple grocery list . -HTC.EVO	-1
I added several of my POP3 email accounts to this app . It would get a certain amount of email from one account , and all from the others . Could never get it to sync with my main account , so I gave up and uninstalled it . Was hoping it might work for my Android phone , but I guess I 'll get something better .	-1
Appears to be a forked version of K9 , although I ca n't tell the difference . Just get the original , K9 . See the marketplace .	-1
Does n't seem to work well with AOL mail . Tried 4x ... setup nea info , new passwords , etc ... nothing worked . Sorry , I dix give it a chance .	-1
It never worked for me at all . It was deleted the same day I purchased it . It was trash . It was horrible . It was not for download . LOL .	-1
Just like other match three games , with the added insult of poorly written story and lame game mechanics . I want puzzle quest for my droid !	-1
Played for 30 seconds , its a fish themed bejeweled clone . If that sounds like a good time to you , hey , go for it .	-1
I have no idea what this is . one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen	-1
Hated it .	-1
This game deserves 5 stars , at least if you like risk-style games , because it truly is Risk on steroids.However , as someone who has played both the lite and full version I have a couple complaints : - The full version only has ONE map ( supposedly you can buy more ) ! - Although it says you can play a full game on the lite version , this is NOT true . It ends the game after a little bit . Even though it is ad supported and does n't have a quarter of the features . What ? My friend has the full version , and it 's fun , but until they get some new maps and features I 'm not shelling out 4 $ .Either make the lite version worth people 's time for ad revenue or give us our money 's worth with the full version ! -	-1
with a kindle fire this program is incredibly hard to click on countries . the screen jumps all around the place as well	-1
this is probably the stupidest app I ever EVER got for my kindle fire ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! it would n't even work the way the app said and that person that said it was addicting your untitled to your own point of view	-1
I hate it ya I love to play different sports but this one is just crap just saying do n't get it .	-1
Downloaded this and played for about 10 minutes before uninstall . Was an OK game , but very basic . I like Flik-n-Kick Football much better for the same type of game play .	-1
it may just be me but I tried this app out and it was n't letting me make a single basket I shot it in the right direction but it wast just going in the opisite direction . I do not recommend	-1
I love the idea ... its just like the maze balls you can buy at toy stores ... but like everyone says ... as soon as it falls of the game freezes.. no force close ... just freeze ... it 's like they never programmed the logic for what to do if it falls ... really dumb ... anyways.. I 'll hold out hope for an update ... tried on Asus transformer and Samsung vibrant ... no luck	-1
at first this is a very fun game , but as you advance the button you press becomes smaller and starts moving . once this happens the button becomes unresponsive and the other player wins every time . as you loose the button get bigger . once it is full size it works again . this is very frustrating and needs to be fixed .	-1
It is a stupid app for match.com I guess it does what it does and not even very well at that . It allows for NO SCREEN ROTATION . Blocks me from DLing pictures . So it is basically half of what one would expect .	-1
Barely functions . The app on my blackberry is far superior . Does n't send emails . Does n't save favorites . Pictures are grainy . Ca n't see the person 's full preferences . So you do n't know what age range they are interested in . It 's free . Maybe that 's why they do n't try to improve it .	-1
Not only does Match charge you monthly , but with sites like POF , you can have WAY more luck ... for free . I did n't like how Match just sent my random & # 34 ; Matches & # 34 ; .	-1
Yeah , no purpose other than pressing the button and looking at the words . I usually dont have a bunch of friends around to play .	-1
I play on a kindle I mean obviously I 'm gon na b playing games alone . This has no computer option . U have to have multiple people with u to play . Totally ruined it for me .	-1
This sounded like a great game but I did n't realize until after I downloaded it that it was only for face-to-face play . Not having friends that enjoy games like this I had to uninstall it because it was useless . There needs to be the ability to play online against random people .	-1
I got this as the free app of the day today from Amazon.This is a two or more player guess the word game . In this variation of this type of game , there are words given besides the word you are trying to guess that can not be used as clues since they are good clues to guess the word with and is a rather intentional effort to make the game more difficult.I am giving this game only ( you guessed it from the title of the review ) TWO stars out of five for the following reasons:1 . This is a game that requires more than one person to play.2 . The rules need some tweaking . For example , there appears to be no rule stating whether a word that rhymes with the given word is allowed such as brass for grass.3 . This app is way too large ( well over 20 Megs ) for a simple game that relies heavily on words and not graphics.4 . That annoying robot voice reminds me a lot of that robot that shows up every season now of Big Brother.5 . Words may be repeating often.If the developer would get rid of the robot , shrink the app down in size , fix the rules , and could make the words more random , then this would be more like a 4 star app .	-1
Received only 7 commentaries ; I did not get all the commentaries shown in the illustration ; Got only : Geneva , Barnes , Coffman , Matt.Henry , Abbott , Jameison-Faussett and Lightfoot . Did not get 4 Fold Gospel , etc .	-1
It worked in the fact that it was like Nextel - push the button and talk . But the app had to be running for everyone . If the app was off , it did n't work . It could be great for people who talk to each other a lot , but I find texting is typically more efficient .	-1
Glad it was `` free '' ... except for my time ! This lasted less than three minutes on my Droid.Totally stupid . As someone else said , to paraphrase , it went from hard to ruthless . It does n't even start off slow to get you used to the controls . Off you go ! I uninstalled it in minutes . StOOpid `` game '' even for free . Who BUYS this ?	-1
Not worth it at all ! I beat the game within 15 minutes , hoping to unlock more levels , but there are only two . For a whole dollar . For a mobile game thats ridiculous . And you need to buy a level pack for more levels , Which is ANOTHER DOLLAR . Ridiculous .	-1
I guess if you enjoy playing the same stage over and over , this game is for you . Could be okay if the difficulty increased with the stages , but it starts off hard .	-1
The most boring and uninteresting game I have ever played . I 'd rather listen to Vogon poetry . I am glad it was free today , because I would feel ripped off if I paid 25c even . Uninstalled immediately .	-1
I have tried many times at this game and I never get past the first 30seconds of the level . very frustrating . I an see where people would like that sort if game , but for me , I have much more important things to be frustrated about	-1
This game is about as fun as a fart that surprises you with wet butt cheeks . Only one control , and it responds poorly to boot . I 'm all for keeping it simple , but this simply is not fun . This game is impossible for all the wrong reasons .	-1
The ad says to give this game a try , but I ca n't find the link to get the trial version or try it online . What gives ?	-1
Free is actually too much money for this . If this app was a performer on stage in front of an audience , I would throw fruit at it .	-1
I think they should change the name to Monotonous or maybe insanity ? Graphics lacking , soundtrack is nice though . Glad it was free .	-1
yeah simple games are supposed to be fun . this game is simple and soo boring . dont waste your time on such a crappy game . f	-1
wasting time , like most of the games , but , have to use some math strategies which can help . good pictures and color	-1
So many people like this , including my 27-year-old daughter , that I had to try it . Personally , I do n't see the attraction and got bored pretty quickly with it .	-1
I have tried to download angry birds ad free about 15times . each time I try , It says there was an error in purchasing . it also says click here for suggestions . it never gives me anything . helpful .	-1
paid for but can not run due to failing license checks . another case of licensing making honest customers pay the price . a waste of a buck .	-1
this is probobly the most boring game I have ever played . its fun for 5 minutes but it gets stupid after that . its not Even ad free ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! & iexcl ; ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
DO NOT get this app . It DELETES my progress ( I had almost finished the game . ) I HATE this STUPID app . WARNING ! ! DO NOT GET THIS APP ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
Did not load properly on my Kindle . Was a waste of time to try to get it to load . I 'm usually very very happy with Amazon and the apps but not this one .	-1
of all games to become the popular mobile app , this seems the least deserving . it 's a wonderful study in how people are just sheep that go along with what is considered cool .	-1
Love the game , a bit bothered that the free version on the Play Store gets updated before the paid versions on the Amazon app store . Not sure whose fault it is , but unacceptable either way !	-1
I asked Rovio how my coarse network location enhances game play , but they do n't want to tell me , so uninstalling . Still do n't understand why a non-geospacial game needs to know where I am .	-1
There is absolutely NO REASON this PAID & quot ; ad-free & quot ; game needs access to my location , my accounts , or even open network sockets.Vote with your wallet and say NO to apps with invasive permissions !	-1
get the free version . it has all the same levels but with the ads that rarely bother me and if u turn off the wifi , theyre r no ads .	-1
I 'm about halfway through the levels and it 's getting pretty boring . Just more of the same ; variation on a theme .	-1
I thought this game would be engaging for adults as I had read about my friends on Facebook playing this game and moving through it quickly . I purchased this game thinking it would be a nice diversion . It is so simple any idiot could play it . It is great for kids 10 and under but anyone older than 10 would find it boring . My husband played it once ; I have n't played it and wo n't bother . Wish I could get my money back .	-1
For kindle users : the hd version is on 2.3.0 or the latest version with the new surf n turf levels and the new bad piggies levels . I did n't get this but the hd version is up to date . Also the hd version has the mighty eagle . For phones : why not use the google play version ?	-1
it wanted me to go to youtube for instructions ... I do n't want to do that ... it needs instructions at the beginning of it .	-1
Didnt play thos . It is my sons game . It will not go off my review screen u.tol.I write something about it	-1
I Honestly Wont Re-Install This app . Caused of Freezes , So , i Would n't Re-Install . Get My Point ? Hope So . Do n't get this app if you want to prevent your Device From freezing . Well , I 'd Recomend & quot ; Bad Piggies & quot ; For Your Kindle , iPod , Whatever . I Would Also Recomend & quot ; Angry Birds Seasons & quot ; . Hope u Hate This App . I got this App for free because it was The free app of the day in September .	-1
get the hd version it has the migthy eagle and it has free powerups : p dont get this just get the hd one its only two dollars more .	-1
This version of Angry Birds makes me angry : 1. because I paid for it ; 2. because I can not get my money back ; and 3. because I wasted 1 second of my life playing this poorly designed game .	-1
I would have kept my old ad supported version if I knew it had their ads ( pause screen ) in it . just keep the net off like the other version to hide them .	-1
this app can crack the Ipod or iphone I witnessed it twice ( thank good news it was n't my stuff that broke it was my friends stuff anyways this app well all angry birds can crack ur screen with only a touch while playing sometimes it does not crack for a so Just LOOK OUT	-1
happy there are no ads u may think that free is great but payimg a buck with no ads is better ! i wulda paid twice aw much to get ad free : )	-1
The game starts up fine and the music starts playing but then I get an Amazon Market error and it closes the game.Really amazon ?	-1

Why is a credit card required to download a free app ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? I have a balance in my Amazon gift card account , why will they not let me apply that to my Amazon App store account ? Rovio , please just put this in the regular app store .	-1
The game looks much better . New elements to enjoy . No ads to get on the way , and despite the better graphics , theres less lag on my lg optimus ( whereas before there was some on the more intense levels ) . All in all a much better and more polished game .	-1

Angry Birds Rio : Boring and too many interruptions to play . Have played Angry Birds on my son 's device and this is not even close to as much fun .	-1

I got other angry bird games free and am still not done . I enjoy them , I paid for this one and got done in one night . There are only 2 levels and 2 that saying `` Coming soon '' I feel ripped off . They do not even give you a full game . Why didnt they hold on to it till they finished it instead of saying `` coming soon `` for 1/2 the game . 2 out of the 4 levels are locked	-1
Do n't install the update . It just adds spam to buy their music , with no way to turn it off . Another thing your kids will buy if you forget to lock your WIFI .	-1
They are still putting ads in these apps ! What 's worse , now that I 've uninstalled it , Amazon wo n't remove it from my list , a constant reminder that I should never have downloaded this app .	-1

This is not the app you want to use for the kindle Fire . Download the other task killer with the red X . Also free , more features .	-1

It is available for Kindle Fire but no apps show up in the task list . It does n't seem to work . Please update .	-1

I do not recommend this for your kindle fire HDIt makes it work funny , lags , and glitches a lot..I took it off and got the GeminiWorks like a charmHave Gemini on both kindlesDefinitely use task killer on your android phones..	-1
I can only give angry birds : season one star . : - ( It would not download to my kindle after I bought it . But it looks fun , and I like the original Angry Birds .	-1
Terrific , an ad free version of Angry Birds Seasons ! It actually updated my ad version of Seasons and kept all my previous scores , eggs , etc . Flawless installation .	-1
failed to update this paid version to Easter version . super lame . buy your apps through market not Amazon unless you want to wait longer or possibly never for updates .	-1
Ridiculous . Rovio is selling an ad free version but still including ads ? Sure its just a buck but what about consumer protections .	-1
I 'm glad I got this on the free app promo . It seems developers are n't committed to updating apps here . I ca n't see myself paying for apps here if the official Android Market is likely to get newer versions first and continue getting them in the future .	-1
I 've downloaded and enjoyed all of the Angry Bird games and have enjoyed them ; but the SEASONS version is not as fun as it is frustrating . It 's the first of the franchise that I did n't want to finish.First , the weapons are pitiful . For example , I enjoy using only the number and types of weapons I 'm given -- the rest I can use later , once I 'm through the game . To find myself facing targets with only cardinals is maddening . Or those yellow pointy headed ( small ) birds against structures of reenforced wood interlaced with cement ! The underpowered projectile birds simply either remove small chips or bounce . The sweet spots are few and very difficult to hit , and the damage is minimal ! And when you do get a good weapon ( projectile ) , there 's mostly just one followed by three or four worthless ones . In one play , if you want to hit a snowball at the top of a mountain holding back some boulders , you have to hit it directly on to drop the boulders . Extremely close is n't good enough.Finally there are what I call & quot ; immortal widgets & quot ; -- green little piggies that no matter what happens manage to end up under a pile of concrete and steel , well fortified against attack . No matter where you hit the enemy piggies , the same one tends to end up in the same place , safely ensconced in the rubble ! So this version needs a bit more time on the drawing board . Like I said , it 's more frustrating than fun .	-1
App worked just fine before this update . Now it wont even open . Now thats what I call ad free ! Please fix or advise .	-1
On the 'White Pandigital Novel ' Android 2.01 based tablet/eReader this program if you can get it to install as many are uable to and the all the graphics do not display correctly .	-1
I want my money back . I ca n't play this game . It keeps shuting off and going back to the home screen . Im sick of amazon when it comes to ANGRY BIRDS . Either the update is extremely late or I ca n't play it one the update is done . I WANT MY MONEY BACK	-1
I purchased this game for the add free experience that is not offered in the free version . It really bugs me that I have been staring at the free version update in Google Play for almost two months , and Amazon and/or Rovio do not seem too interested in updating the paid one .	-1
very disappointed to learn that the newest release has to have a data connection to work , especially an ad-free version . with unlimited data gone people now have watch how much they use , absurd that a non-online game will incur data charges	-1
lame that it is almost easter and there still isnt an update . amazon needs to resolve the lack of updates if they want to be a competitor with google 's market .	-1
I chose one stare should be none when I bought this did n't know I have to keep buying eagle feather & other helpers . To me it seems harder to complete the levels than the free version . I will keep trying to use the game but so far NOT as fun or as good as the free . I had so many of the levels done with 3 stars & the little fish but not in the version I paid for with no commercial . I can tell you I loved the free version but the commercial drove you nuts.Good luck to all that buy this I hope you will like it & enjoy as for me so far YUK	-1
I have to re-register with Amazon.com every time I want to play the game - which automatically sets up a new device on my account and causes other apps to fail . I paid for this app !	-1
The game is fun and 4 or 5 star worthy , but I am getting video ads after levels . That 's pretty ridiculous to pay , but still get ads .	-1
I just recently updated the Angry Birds Seasons ad free , because it said I needed to , and what this update did is removal of 2012 , it deleted the new episode from 2013 , and deleted all of my save data . I am highly upset with this fact because I paid 99 cents to not have ads in my Angry Birds Seasons . So it looks like I 'm going to have to uninstall this and install the Google play version which works . The last review that I wrote Amazon pulled it off for reasons unknown . It was on that way out west game , I still have that review and I do n't think there was anything wrong with it . The only thing that I said derogatory of it is that I was kind of shock that people could not figure out the training levels.Amazon likes to censor what the reviewers say , which I feel is wrong and I think it violates our first amendment rights . In my review I did not curse , I did not insult the dev , or any one person in any way . ( Hence i did not break the rules ) . They just pulled it off to censor me . I 'm also going to say also that if Amazon removes this very truthful review of what their company did to my software which I paid for. , but they better be prepared to give me a refund on every app in which I paid for . And that over 20 dollars worth . Because after all this morning my Angry Birds season work correctly , now I only have 4 episodes . So if my review get pulled off for telling the truth that says a lot about your company .	-1
As you may notice , the title does n't let you know until after you purchase that it is for Android . Maybe I should just pay better attention and not get pulled into something that is n't in large print . I paid for nothing . Ca n't load on my kindle and I do n't have android	-1
This will never work on the moto droid . Dont waste your time . The other angry birds work but not the seasons . As you can see from the other reviews on the web this is common problem . I suggest downloading Angry Birs classic .	-1
I just got a pop-up ad for McDonald 's . This needs to be fixed . I accidentally clicked it and my phone froze .	-1
I purchased the Ad-Free version . To my disappointment , it has advertisements . They are the most annoying types of advertisements . Full video ads with sound . The advertisements are annoying and disrupt the gameplay . Very disappointing .	-1
I just updated my paid version and now it never goes past the loading screen ... then it just quits and exits the entire app . Please fix soon ! ! !	-1
In my opinion , given only a few minutes with today 's update , this app is now harder to enter , and to view data with than before . Looking at the app store screens ( still the old version ) makes me long for the old version back . : - ( Perhaps I 'll get used to it over time .	-1
Useless app.Does n't do anything . I do n't even get it . Amazon , can you get more useful apps for free , like uuh ... I do n't know .. useful apps yeah games and apps that anyone really actually likes	-1
cant even use this app . tells me to select menu , but there 's no menu available . does n't work on my fire or g2x .	-1
I still ca n't get this app to recognize a decimal when I define a tracker on my Kindle Fire , in spite of the update message that this issue was addressed . This makes a potentially very useful app not so appealing to me . Luckily for me it was the free app of the day when I downloaded it .	-1
it is not easy to store multiple value or interval units like blood pressure . for the same tracker I want to be able to track more than one value at a time and if that value is numeric than it should have a meaning on the graph .	-1
I 'm trying to track meetings within a group and it does n't work as one would expect . I have a small group that I would like to track individual meetings with . That means that I have a GROUP and then I would like to have individual people inside of the group . It keeps the main UI less cluttered and easier to organize ( kind of like folders ) .The best way to work with the subtasks of the group would be to have the option to add values to a specific subtask . Instead values are assigned to ALL subtasks of the group . This does n't make any sense and really breaks the usability of this app ( for me at least ) . For example , if I meet with someone in my small group I want to track the date of that `` event '' . When I add a date it is automatically added to EVERYONE in my small group . What 's the point of creating a group for events when it 's the same as just creating a single event ? Other types of entry ( numeric ) work a little more as expected , but still record data even if nothing is entered for a subtask ( if left blank it still shows for that task ) .I really hope the developer will fix this and as a result GREATLY improve the functionality .	-1
this app does only a swipe back and forth . it looks neat but i was over it in 10 seconds . so was my 11 year old . dumb .	-1
I 've owned this game for less than 5 minutes and I 'm already bored out of my mind . It would be a lot more fun if it changed colors or something . The only entertaining thing about this is the sound effects .	-1
all it does when u move the kindle fire it turns on then when u move it some more the light thing just moves NEVER GET THIS APP	-1
There is only one colour and that is red . You can only turn it off and on and shake it . Sure it makes cool sounds but unless this app is so you can fall asleep at night , well your out of luck.I made a mistake up there . The app is so boring , that it would n't put you to sleep . You would probably die of boredom .	-1
ehhhh ... ... . its ok. nothing snazzy . only 2 swinging sounds and the on/off sound . no cool clashing effects like hitting another	-1
I could n't figure out what this app does . If you download it , maybe you 'll have better luck than I did . Of course , my expectations were simple-I just wanted an app that gave me the light-saber sounds , but this did n't do that for me .	-1
The light saber does n't turn on or off.It just has a kind of always on reset function.It only makes the wooshing sound when tipped to the right.And if you hold it to the right it just keeps swinging the saber like it 's banging it 's head against a wall.Might wan na look fora better app but for free it does n't hurt to much to try .	-1
I did n't listen to the reviews and got but it sucks its just a dumb & quot ; lightsabber & quot ; that goes up and down like what the hell so just dnt get it pleeeeeeaaaaasssssseeeeee !	-1
I downloaded the app and 5 to 7 seconds later I deleted it . I shook the Kindle Fire and 1 second later the saber moved side to side . This is a really , tremendously , incredably , horrible , terrible stupidly retarded app . DO N'T GET THIS APP ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
Load time was unacceptable , then it crashed my phone ( Droid X ) . Downloaded as part of the free app of the day promotion from Amazon , and now it 's just taking up space on my list of purchased apps .	-1
I do n't like this version of tank hero that much but I recommend tank hero : laser wars if u want a fun version of it .	-1
well everything worked really but to me this game was just kinda boring . I think it was just too easy to get through the levels so it gets 2 stars ...	-1
I just downloaded this app and I am immediately sending it to the trash bin ! What are you thinking by putting the trashy ads ? It would have been a nice game , but do n't want to see the ads or support anyone who wants to promote them ! ! I wish I could give it a & quot ; minus & quot ; score !	-1
it lacks vital trading information , too many variables and complications make it a waste of time , I miss the palm original ... might uninstall	-1
It 's a fun game , but the menu and other touch screen controls do n't work . You ca n't do anything but play and exit . Needs to be fixed .	-1
I only played it once and I automatically hated it why would a game like this be invented it would come in handy if you could n't fall asleep.I HATE THIS GAME ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
I usually like the retro style that pew pew is in , however it crashes every time I am about to actually play . The game opens , I navigate the menus , but hit start and crash . Disapointed .	-1
I like it , but I do n't . Ever since some sort of update it has n't been able to open . And I ca n't save any of my work . So that sucks .	-1
I deleted . Anything that wants to access my personal information , etc . and wants to send me automatic feeds I wo n't load . I do n't want advertising or to be sold all the time .	-1
It is a cool app when you can get it to work . On my Kindle Fire you are lucky to get it to erase or draw ! It use fixing up . I am deleting this app .	-1
I finally poped for the $ 5 version , and what a difference . Mobile X seemed to have locked out all the good tools , but that 's what you have to expect for free .	-1
UPDATEok this is an update . The app now has been de-updated back to the first version . Now it does n't even work.ORIGINAL REVIEWI have honestly tried most of the drawing/sketching apps on the amazon appstore . And out of all of them this is definetly the best one out there ! And at the low low cost of FREE it ca n't get any better ! You could pay $ 80 on a set of pencils , paint , paintbrushes , etc . or you could get this app ! Its incredible ! I would seriously recommend this application to anybody who likes to sketch at all . Just some of the things on it is ... Brush thickness , opacity , cool color tools , different brushes , text , layers , and more ! Bottom line . ( DO NOT ) GET IT .	-1
It didnt have anything that was really exciting . Doodle club definately beats this app . It didnt have a very good view of art	-1
I did n't use it enough to know whether I liked it or not . I think it is ok though . Check it .	-1
DIDNT MEAN TO GET IT NEVER USED IT SO IM GETTING RID OF IT SO I CANT GIVE U AN ANSWER ON IT SORRY	-1
Does not work on the kindle Fire . Installed different versions ... never worked trying to use my Jib Jab app . Also would not play certain You Tube videos ... Waste of a download .	-1
It did not work for me .	-1
This works great on my desk top computer but is very slow on my Kindle . trying to read a book using this PDF is impossible - find something more suitable .	-1
This app does not work on the Kindle Fire . What else can you say about it . Neither does Flash Player work on Kindle Fire .	-1
VERY HARD TO POST THIS APP SO THAT YOU CAN PUT IT TO GOOD USE , NOT ENOUGH INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO GET THE APP TO WORK ON YOUR DEVICE ,	-1
Not sure where the breakdown is between kindle and adobe , but it is very inconvenient , very slow and often wo n't load properly . Have to load things several times . Adobe is good , kindle is good , but they do n't mix well .	-1
I ca n't get it to work with the Facebook platform and Im not able to play my game 's on Facebook . With my kindle fire . I am unhappy about that .	-1
was a challenge to figure out which one to purchase based on available product descriptions.seams to work ok once i figured out which one to buy	-1
I thought I was getting the ADOBE FLASH PLAYER for my Kindle Fire HDX in order to play the games on Face Book but King.com has NOT made an app for some of the games yet , so I do NOT use it and took it off my Kindle	-1
There is NO reflow text and text size options on the kindle fire version . Makes reading regular 8.5 x 11 pages very difficult . The version on my HTC incredible is better as it does have them . They say it does reflow text but there is no option I can find . I wonder if adobe is losing it . I hate version 10 on the PC while I enjoyed version 9 . Looks like quality control is seriously lacking . Guess I will look for a better reader for pdfs .	-1
Did not work . Kept stating that it could not locate download and I downloaded it several times . Finally I just deleted the download .	-1
do n't get this . just go on your kindle fire Internet settings and click on flash and turn it on . very easy .	-1
Tried to download to my Kindle Fire HD 7 & # 34 ; tablet , seemed to be downloading alright but when tried to use would not open , maybe it 's just me but Abode works well on my home computer have had it for years	-1
Will not install on Velocity Cruz tablet T301 . Glad it was free . Please label appropriately . Am having this problem too often on the Amazon Market .	-1
I am new at technology and not sure how to use this app . Maybe as I get a little further along I will get to know what I am doing .	-1
Cant get it to run on my HD Kindle Fire . : ( Have to wait till AMZ . Works it out with Adobe .	-1
Wished I had n't as I found out I do n't really need it . It 's great of course on my desktop computer . But a total waste on the Kindle Fire HD .	-1
At this time I do not use it . I like the digital books . The digital works at a faster pace .	-1
This was not what i expected . It did not work for me for some reason . I would have gave no stars , but you have to rate something .	-1
Every time I try to install this app it never works , I would love to have this app or somethng like it that works on my kindle . I was very dissapointed .	-1
do not down load it gave me a malware program on my phone and took for ever to get off it	-1
This app does give you the ability to view . Pdt files . It does n't do it well . Documents are free floating , movable in all directions making the document difficult to navigate and read . I purchased QuickDocs Pro , primarily for the word processor and spreadsheet . I noticed it had a .Pdt reader , opened a document with it on a whem , now I 'm uninstalling Adobe Reader . I can not recommend this app .	-1
It does nothing for me , I need another Adobe software and I ca n't seem to get it to downloadWord	-1
Have n't tried it yet.there 's games I ca n't get that I have on my computer that I will like to play ca n't get it	-1
Works good . I need it to play any vidios and such on my Kindle Fire . Since it is free , you miswell check it out and see if it works for you .	-1
This application was not not much help , needed adobe flash . do n't get it unless you need to read pdf files .	-1
This app wo n't download completely , so I ca n't pull it up . It now takes up cloud space and I ca n't delete it .	-1
Brand new Kindle Fire HD . Fails every time I attempt to update and will no longer read pdf files . Fail .	-1
never use it so i can not tell if it is good or bad so your choice to buy or not	-1
Never worked for my being able to view videos at my sites . WFN , INFISHERMAN , and various other outdoor sites . I apparently am too stupid to figure out your program needs .	-1
Why ca n't they add page bookmark ? This is a very simple app not much it can do . Not very good .	-1
its probably good for people who know how to put it to use . but i dont , i downloaded it and still cant get video on my kindle hd	-1
Something will say I need to open with Adobe . I do that and it does n't open . Very confusing , and pointless . I would n't recomend .	-1
Very limited edit . I was unable to zoom pictures or apply edits to a targeted area . Must have Air installed as well , so add that to memory it takes up to . Really expected a more robust and feature filled app .	-1
This barebones picture editor is n't worthy of having the name adobe associated with it . Just search around on the market , you 'll find dozens of better apps out there .	-1
I would love to try this app but it does n't read photos on the sd card and since I save directly to it the app does n't work for me .	-1
An okay little photo editor for very basic adjustments , but something this limited should never have the name & quot ; photoshop & quot ; attached to it . It 's only slightly better than the stock app that came with my phone . If I was Adobe , I 'd be embarrassed as hell to have my name attached to this .	-1
you can change minor filters but it is n't PhotoShop at all . just black and white or rainbow tone and a crop feature . how crapalicious . this is not worth your time	-1
There is really no use for this , other than advertise their overpriced desktop app . Skip this and get one of the many apps that take the platform seriously .	-1
I ca n't imagaine that Adobe would put their name on this App ... it does nothing ! Its completely worthless ... get `` Touch-up Pro '' and `` Autodesk Sketch '' .	-1
This app does not even compare to quickoffice or officesuite pro . It can do SOME things , but in reality ... it is not worth paying for . The free viewer is worth it ... and that 's it .	-1
There 's an update here in amazon , I update it , then an update for it shows up in Google Play ( the same version ) , I update it there , it says I need to update here again - NEVER CHANGING THE VERSION NUMBER ! FIX THIS ! Besides that , the app is so-so . A few more updates to Google Docs & amp ; this app useless anyway .	-1
I have worked with word processors since the first versions on DOS thru Windows . This is not a good substitute for a good word processor . Sorry I spent the money to upgrade to premium .	-1
Got this to view some pdf files I had already downloaded . The reviews were good so I chose this over Adobe . It would not let me look at them unless I paid . Downloaded Adobe and that worked great .	-1
You ca n't really do anything unless you buy the full version . So this is n't really a review . Just an informative statement I guess .	-1
it was n't what I thought it would be I thought it would be more like Microsoft word but it may work for other people tho	-1
You have to get the $ 15.00 full version to create docs ! SHAME ON YOU , DataViz , Inc.This app is stupido !	-1
I gave review on this already . I do n't remember buying it and I wish you would stop asking me if I liked it . I can only review the items I recall buying .	-1
i is not a good app . documents to to go is stupid i hate it . dont get it its not ok. i love lots of things but this no way .	-1
YOU CAN NOT DRAW PICTURES TO GO WITH STORIES WAY WAY WAT TO COMPLICATED . NOT FOR ME OR ANY ONE UNDER 18 TEEN I COULD NOT EVEN FIGURE OUT HOW TO TYPE ON IT OR EVEN LESS VIEW DOCUMENTS	-1
It is absolutely a waste of time to get this app ! ! I thought it would let you use Microsoft office ! its a trick trying to get you to buy the full version which is VERY expensive ! it wo n't let you do anything ! ! ! ! !	-1
I tried to read a file created with Word 2010 and this does n't read it . Says it only reads up to 2008 .	-1
I tried to make a speech but you ca n't because it says you need the paid version to do it .	-1
this app came on my fire kindle . i installed it , regestered it only to find all the promised functions are locked up until you purchase the full product . Talk about a waste of storage space . skip this free app ! _	-1
I did n't receive what I wanted . It might be alright for some uses by it was n't what I was looking for .	-1
I bought this app and it had tons of hoops to jump through in order for me to use it . Waste of money !	-1
Product description lies about track changes . This app does NOT allow you to track changes , contrary to the product description . The track changes features supported are very limited and not at all what are required of an editor . I am extremely disappointed and upset I wasted 10 dollars on this app . I will be contacting Amazon for a refund .	-1
If you bought an Acer Iconia A-500 the Amazon version is incompatible with the the version of DTG included with the tablet . You ca n't delete it either . Kudos to Amazon for refunding my purchase without question and giving me a $ 5 credit for my inconvenience . Jeers to Acer for sticking its users with a piece of bloatware that prohibits you from getting the full version at a lower price . Oh , and Amazon , save yourselves and your customers some aggrivation and tell users up front you ca n't buy this from Amazon 's apps store .	-1
ok , awesome app for a free app of the day , and I have used the basic version that came on my droid 3 , buuuutttttt ... when I try to download through the link in the app to complete the installation it links me to a 404 page not found error . Come on DataViz do your due diligence on your app and insure all links are valid . if I had paid 14.99 for this I would be livid .	-1
I need box.net , dropbox , and iDisk account types . Much better with iOS than Kindle Fire . The price is pretty steep for so little integration .	-1
Got Full Paid version when it was the free app . Used to work , then I upgraded my phone , and reinstalled it . All it does now is tells me to go back to the store or to their web site to download a newer version . When I do , it wo n't install . USELESS ! Good thing I have OfficeSuite ( works well in ICS ) and QuickOffice ( ca n't access SD card , but works ) .	-1
I used this program successfully on my pc . For my LG Ally , it is a disaster . On all of several updates , it put me back to the free version every time , causing no end of difficulties with Dataviz to get things corrected and the paid-for version enabled . It also messed up my filing system . Highly disappointed , I unloaded the free version but not the key which I paid $ 14.99 for . I simply do not use Dataviz any more and do not recommend it . Use Dropbox and you 'll be much happier -- and it 's free .	-1
Very simplistic , 2D traffic control game . There 's no attempt at considering elevation , no view other than top down , nothing realistic about the shapes of flight paths ( draw sharp angles , curlicues , etc , and the jets willb follow them . ) If i had paid money for this , i 'd be angry , but since it was free app of the day , all I 'm out is time . i gave 2 stars only because it does n't force close and does n't assault the user with ad . Uninstalled .	-1
I read through many of the comments on here and I was stunned . So here is the scoop.This game should not be supported . It is an almost identical duplicate to a game called Flight Control.Some say that this is open source and its okay . No , that is not true . The Android operating system is open source , the software developed for the OS is not open source.Some say this is okay because it has a `` similar concept '' to flight control . It is not similar , it is a duplicate with only some minor graphical changes.Paying for this software is more akin to purchasing bootleg DVD 's from street vendors . By purchasing and supporting this program you are basically supporting criminals who knowingly engaged in violating copyright law . If Namco pursued legal action against Grapevine they would certainly win . Every purchase of Air Control is a lost sale that Namco deserves.I downloaded this app to see if there were any differences between the two games and there really is n't . The only difference is that Grapevine is undercutting Namco by $ 1.00 in price.Ask yourself , if you created something that took your time and money to do and then someone made a mirror image of it and sold it for close to half your cost would you consider that fair ? Legal ? Ethical ? Moral ? If you actually said yes to any of those rhetorical questions , then I pity you as a person .	-1
Boo . Does n't even try to innovate on top of being a straight clone of Flight Control . Contrary to what others are saying about everybody copies everybody , successful flatteries are those that innovate several elements on top of the original . The main case was Angry Birds from Crush the Castle . At least with Angry Birds , theme and presentation changed . Neither is different with this title , and such it deserves to be shamed with 1 star.As for the game itself , other posts are true : small install size , simplified presentation . No music , bare bones menu system .	-1
Why does this game need to know where I am ? I am not an airplane , so out does n't make sense that it tracks my movement. ( Wow ... 2 of 15 helpful votes ... do people really like spyware on their devices that much ? Or do they just not understand the risk and are mad because I exposed their fun game for its evil purposes ? Chime it , I want to know ! )	-1
In order to play this game , you have to agree to a ripped-off EULA that does not fit with the current state of the Amazon App Store . This may have been a case of the developer failing to understand the EULA .For example , they use the single user license , but Amazon lets you download the game to multiple phones that are tied to your Amazon account . You *cant* buy the app again .	-1
I used to love this game . Now every time I play it bricks my phone and I have to remove the battery just to exit the game . FIX IT PLEASE ! Xperia X10 .	-1

disappointed ... no poker or gaming allowed on kindle fire products ... boooooooooo ... ... ... .bought several games for the kindle fire such as zynga poker etc and could not play as well ... ...	-1
I downloaded this game for my husband to use on my kindle . He already has one on his phone , so since I 'm not interested in playing I have no use for it .	-1
I downloaded this to my kindle fire and quickly found out that it was not the game for me , it might be for others .	-1
Not user friendly , the reviews I read said that the app did not work well so that was enough for me not to open the application for use .	-1
slow and limited on only six players per table . donkey fest if you know what I mean . & # 34 ; free & # 34 ; does n't make it worthwhile to play .	-1
This app has great visuals , however , the actual play is very confusing . Do not believe this is me as a novice , because , for years , I made my living as both a live and video poker player . If I change my outlook on this app , I will amend my review .	-1
I deleted it from my tablet . I had did n't read enough about it I guess . Did n't know it was interactive game .	-1
low rating as game was slow to open or play for me . Maybe it my wi-fi , but other games or apps do well with what i have . Also after reading some reviews , seems alot of info is shared . I do not recommend .	-1
The fact that it wants to record and manipulate messages received is just wrong . On top of that the seemingly endless list of permissions is just too much for me to bother .	-1
Thought it would be like the ones you hear on TV . Totally not . A woopie cushion would have been better .	-1
it takes forever to download it is imature and it is a total chick deterrent . and it is like almost impossiblex to un download it and it makes me so board that I would rather watch old episodes of barney	-1
What a fool I was for letting my son purchase this app ! Funny at first , it quickly becomes an old and played out joke . I wanted to give it 3 stars for the nostalgia of innocent humor . But , in today 's politically correct society , this app can get a boy into a lot of trouble ...	-1
not realy , do n't care for it too much . kinda annoying . the boys seem to think its all fun and funny .	-1
Pretty funny ... but most of the sounds sound more like bears than farts . I turned up the volume on my kindle so the app could be heard thinking my little brother would get a kick out of it ... but it 's not really all that good v ( & deg ; ~ & deg ; ) v	-1
