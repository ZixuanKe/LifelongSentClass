This is what it is ... A super cheap mono cable . It should be sufficient for many needs and is cheap enough that thin wire gauge and such can be forgiven . Just be aware that it is cheap and unshielded , etc.For the price and intent , I almost gave it 5 stars . But it 's not a 5-star cable ... It 's a fair quality ultra cheap cable . 4 stars seems about right . ( Yes , this is almost exactly what I wrote about the other Hosa cable I reviewed . )	1
this is the 2nd tuner like this that I have purchased . it really is dependable and works great for basic tuning of my guitar . the battery lasts a long time as well , which is not true with all little tuners like this one . all in all I am very happy with this purchase . small price to pay to be in tune . I would highly recommend it if what you are looking for is a dependable , inexpensive way to accurately tune your instrument .	1
Lots of juice , easy settings , very clean sound with all the horsepower you would need . I have n't jacked it up all the way ... .I do n't think the cat would appreciate that . I get a little feedback every so often , occasionally it 's a little overly sensitive to my volume control on the guitar , but not enough to submarine this power packed amp . How do you get that much noise out of an 8 & # 34 ; speaker ?	1
This pedal does exactly what my title suggests ... it creates a huge walk of smooth rich fuzz ... very smashing pumpkins feel to this . It does n't do many different tones , but what it does it does very well ! And frankly , once I find a good tone out of a pedal , I do n't change it often anyhow ! This is an amazing value , and a welcome party of my pedal boards . ( P.S . : I have the Russian variant ... )	1
This is a really nice , sturdy pedal with a really warm tone . I have a Marshall MG15CFX solid state amp . This pedal sounds really good on the clean channel , but you can hear that it is not designed for a solid state dirty channel . It has given me another tool in my toolbox and basically added a 5th channel to my 4 channel Marshall . Great classic rock 70 's tone ! It responds really well to my pick attack . You really ca n't go wrong for the money .	1
They are well built and can hold almost any speaker system you throw at them . I have already recommended these to a friend and he bought them . He likes them too .	1
I have a 1918 Chezch Violin and it 's sparked my 11 year olds interest . My pegs are in great shape but I figured I 'd get this oil to make starting to play the violin easier on him .	1
I recently picked up aSquier Fretlessbass . As with any guitar , the factory strings left much to be desired . With fretted basses , I 'd always liked strings with a little brassiness . But round-wounds just did n't feel ( or sound ) right on a fretless . Small vibrato was hard to achieve with the string friction . And round-wounds just did n't have that acoustic sound . There were quite a few choices for fretless strings , but I 've always liked D'Addarios on my 6-string guitars . These flat-wounds were a perfect choice . They 've got plenty of bottom , but the midrange is more pronounced than other strings . The bass sounds more like a 'real ' bass . And the action is now so smooth . I can use a small vibrato when I like -- no longer restricted to the wide Jaco-style.There are all sorts of bassists who look for all different sorts of sounds . But there 's something about a fretless that attracts a particular sort of player -- the player who wants a bit of that upright bass sound . As soon as I put these on , I felt like I was home .	1
This is a distortion pedal . It will give your amp a boost for solos and turn a clean amp into a dirty girl . It 's pretty harsh in tone - kind of a white noise distortion . The DS-1 DOES NOT warm up the tone in your amp . You can dial the tone in , but it 's a pretty harsh sounding.That said - the DS-1 does exactly what I wanted it to . My amp gives me a nice warm crunch , classic rock style . The DS-1 gives me the 80 's metal and punk rock sound I wanted , and it does so flawlessly.It took me about 5 minutes of tinkering to get a nice transition from my amp to a matching tone on the DS-1 . It 's BOSS , so it will last forever.Th only drawback is that it 's an item that is currently cheaper elsewhere . Usually Amazon catches up with that sort of thing , but word to the wise , do n't pay more than $ 40 new for this thing .	1
I love this , now I do n't have to find my pick.I bought one and this is my second one for my another guitar.I also purchased an extra one as a gift for my friend .	1
I hang all my gear up in the studio with these and it 's really sturdy . I ca n't say these are easy to get the guitar down off the wall but that 's the point . I 'll use a stand if I 'm going to use a guitar often . I had a 230lb drummer fall into the wall where I had these baby 's hung up and not one fell or almost fell .	1
I had always used the Kyser clip-on-the-top capos ( and still do ) , but I liked the look on this Dunlop clip-on-the-bottom model . It works great and looks better .	1
Does it all . Perfect for cleaning and waxing guitar ; do n't need a bunch of different items ; this does it all .	1
This is an extremely versatile pedal . I was considering getting a reverb or delay pedal , but I decided to go with this instead since it 's infinitely more flexible.There are tons of effects . Some I might not use , but there are plenty I will use . New firmware was just released , and it adds a few extra effects . You download the firmware and install via the USB port.I use it with a VHT special 6 . I have a Fulltone OCD after the Zoom . It works nicely with the tube amp whether or not I turn the OCD on . The effects sound excellent to me . I 'm now a Zoom fan.If you 're lusting after a bunch of effects pedals , but only have the cash for one , this is a really good option . At a minimum , you 'll hopefully figure out the 5-10 you wo n't really use without having to shell out the cash for them .	1
Very good tuner and I love that it attached to the instrument and you can leave it there . I wholeheartedly endorse the product .	1
I gig a lot and since I am a grey haired musician I need to sit when it will be over an hour of playing . This seat works great for me and folds up and can be disassembled with very little fuss . The back rest support is nice , too . For the price its well constructed and perfect for the solo musician doing gigs all over the country .	1
These strings are amazing - they have increased power , tone and flexibility that other strings just do not have . They sound great on single coil and humbucker types of pickups . The tone is seperated throughout the string gauges so that each sting has its own distinctive part of the tone . I cna't say enough about them but get some for yourself - I 'd be surprised if you ever went back to regualr strings .	1
Its affordable and it works . Its a nice little adapter for your low impedance cable to your high impedance input .	1
2 & # 34 ; wide , Nylon strap is well made , comfortable and should last many years . The ends are leather , sewn onto the strap . It has room for adjusting to fit almost anyone , short or tall . Comes in several colors .	1
It 's just unbelievable how well this device holds picks . I mean , you just insert your guitar picks in this device and BAM - it holds them ! No further action is necessary ! And when you need a pick - you just pull one out , and there it is ! What will they think of next ?	1
This guitar is very attractive looking , and plays well right out of the box . I am a beginner guitarist , so please take this review for what it 's worth . I am extremely pleased , and do n't plan on ever upgrading . This guitar is a darker cherry red wood color in the center than shown in the picture . So expect it to be a different color than what you order . See customer pics.It comes with strings installed and almost tuned . The volume knob is well designed for smooth and convenient use . The tremble and rhythm switch is far enough out of the way that you 're not going to accidently hit it while strumming . My only gripe is that the high E string gets caught on the top pickup when I 'm playing hard , but maybe I 'm just a novice . I will say that it 's very easy to play.Everything on it is very adjustable which I also like . The only BUYER BEWARE statement I can think of is : you 're going to be addicted to it !	1
These replaced the stock tuners on my Squier Deluxe Stratocaster and were NOT a drop in fit . There are two pegs on the tuners that did n't line up with the holes from my stock tuners in the headstock and required me to drill additional holes . I was somewhat expecting this thou so no starts taken away.These make string changes so easy and I love the ratio of these tuners . Because they are staggered I was able to ditch the string trees as well .	1
When I first started setting up my little studio , I wanted something that did n't break the budget . I tried a couple different combo pedal boards , ( Digitech 500 , Boss ME-70 ) , but quickly realized I was n't getting my sound and the money was quickly drying up . With not much left , I tried a Tuna Melt as an example of Danelectro . Who would think ? This thing is stunning in its ability to manufacture vintage tremolo sounds , as are most of this line of pedals . I now own about 12-14 of these of all types , and have never been dissapointed save it 's very hard to chain them without a lot of noise.Then I got into guitar building , and they all got put away . Lately , I have been trying to make time to improve my playing skills , and joy of joys ! I am rediscovering all these pedals and I absolutely love them.Forget the FAB series , they are not so hot . Buy the old style as the Tuna Melt , or the big metal ones like the Dan Echo . You will NOT be sorry !	1
Friend of mine has been playing/cleaning/modifying guitars for some 30+ years and this is what he recommended I use on my guitar to clean it . Who am I to argue with him , he 's used them all and said this was the best . Easy to use - a little goes a long way , works very well and shines up nice . He was right - great product !	1
I love these patch cables . They can be serviced if need be , but mine have never needed it . I 've ordered about 3 batches of these guys and I would order them again in the instance that my already excessive pedalboard where to become more complex . The length of the cable presents limitations that should be expected , and the bulb on the ends may be an issue in tight squeezes . However there are many cables of much lesser value , which are unserviceable in the event of a breakdown .	1
As with any new device or toy we buy we discover the good and bad points ... first the good ... .THE GOOD : 8 tracks that can be recorded 2 at a time ... has RCA outs which is good for monitors and or headphone amp as well as a 1/8 '' headphone out ... a durable feel , a nice design , XLR inputs with phantom power , lit screen to see better ( Very Nice ) ... wav 16bit 44khz recordings , auto punch in , comes with a 2gb card and can take up to 32GB SD cards ... has effects has a metronome , mastering internal track apart form the 8 tracks , built in guitar tuner , EQ , Compression in and out , nice dual stereo up front mics that are real good sounding and all 8 track mixing , bouncing to 2 of your tracks even the tracks that are bounced to , the previous tracks 'that are there ' that still are plying bounce too , very cool ... and much more ... .THE BAD : short battery life , No AC adapter included , need to buy ( Cheap off ebay around $ 8.00 ) ... small buttons , bad sounding reverbs , auto punch in gives you 2 seconds after pushing buttons to record , COME ON TASCAM , 2 SECONDS ! ! ! ! ! ? ? ? ? ? ? I ca n't get back into recording part with a guitar in 2 lead in seconds all alone ! ! ! ! ! No guitar effects or Drum patterns like Boss 's BR Micro 4 and 80 ... ( boss has it 's problems too , believe me ) sometimes it just hangs up , ( think there is an unlock or reset pen press thing on the side ) HORRIBLE REVERBS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! moreEven though this untit has its good and not so goods , it is a great device , you can import and export songs to this to and from your computers recording software , remember its 16 bit wavs only to and from DAW ... ..Tascam please lengthin the auto punch lead in from 2 seconds to 5 seconds or more on next firmware and dont make another new unit just to improve what a firmware can do ! ! ! ... .Jim	1
I 've had this for about 2 weeks now and this capo is simple and works great . It feels like plastic but is made of aluminum so it holds very well . If you know how much pressure to apply to the frets , the capo works great though I always have to do a bit of fine tuning , as was expected in the first place . I love how cheap it was compared to the other capos , and yes it 's not made of plastic .	1
This has come in handy many times in my studio Z108.net . We love having it around . Good quality affordable price .	1
For years I used Kyser capos and the handle for them always sticks out and that can be an issue . Planet Waves ' NS has a smoother handle that does n't stick out as much and i 've had no issues with gripping it on or off so far . It is easy to put on and off and it holds the strings down properly . If you 're looking to buy a capo i 'd recommend this over a Kyser .	1
This amp plug is great for the price its 10 ft long the perfect size for jammin at home and it has a quality look to it aesthetically totally worth the price	1
I have a Martin D35 acoustic and strapping it with the string knot around the neck is honestly a bit annoying to do - so i figure what 's a $ 10 investment going to do for me ? make things easier and CLEANER LOOKING - that 's what ! i like it because it really just makes puting the strap on the guitar that much easier and removing it again an easy task.I bought the martin strap to match the color.Martin 18AMS2 Martin Leather Guitar Strap - Brownjust being a martin brand nut i suppose !	1
This is what it shows , a simple small mic stand that dont fall over . Good for table top , cajon hole by floor or recording.Its well made and works well .	1
This little thing is just what I needed for my acoustics . My amp has a tuner but my regular acoustics had no true way of being tuned until now . I have one on each acoustic and they tune them right up . The read-out is easy to see since it gives you color guides to tune by . Red is wayyy off , yellow when you start getting close and green when you are in tune . Great for a quick look in between songs . Highly recommended .	1
I 'm a gadget lover and this is a good one . It makes it very easy to attach or detach your guitar strap to/from the headstock of your guitar or ukulele or other stringed instrument .	1
My daughter is learning how to play and the .11 - .48 string set on my strat are giving her a literal pain.I put a set of the D'Addario NYXY0942 strings on my backup guitar and tuned it up . Usually , I 've had issues when bringing some brands of strings up to pitch , but the D'Addario 's seemed to do a much better job . I nearly always stress the higher pitch strings a bit before bringing them up to their final pitch and they stabilized quickly . The wound strings also seem quite stable . Frequently , it takes up to a couple of days for some strings to settle in , but I 've seen no such issues with the D'Addario's.I usually use thicker strings on my guitars to get a fatter tone , but I was impressed by the sound of these in spite of them being much thinner than I usually like.My daughter is also very happy with them since they 're not quite so tough on her fingers .	1
The D'Addario Balanced Tension strings are a good value , and worth slightly higher price . These are excellent strings , the type that a gigging musician would likely use on their guitar . They are inexpensive and sound great . For somebody that is a casual home musician , coated strings might be a better choice . The difference , somebody that plays a two or three hours every day , will wear out a set of strings long before corrosion sets in . Somebody that plays an hour or two twice a week will likely never wear out their strings and corrosion becomes the bigger problem.The big question for me , is the Balanced Tension worth a little extra money ? It seems like yes they are . The strings are slightly easier to bend and feel just a little bit better . There is n't a huge difference . The direct comparison string is D'Addario EXL110 , ( D'Addario EXL110 Nickel Wound Electric Guitar Strings , Regular Light , 10-46 ) , at roughly $ 3.50 a set , these are good solid strings at a bargain price . The EXL110BT strings are about $ 5.00 a set . If I were going through a set of strings every few days , the EXL110 's would probably be a better idea . But if a set is going to last a week or two , the savings overall is pretty small , I would use the EXL110BT's.My personal preference is coated strings , I like Elixir strings a lot . The new D'Addario coated strings are fine , but they end up being about the same price as Elixir . I 'll stick with what I know well.My 1981 Lucille did love these strings . They worked out just fine.On the packaging , I do n't like what D'Addario has done . All the strings are in a single plastic package , I prefer individual paper envelopes . They loop two strings together and I hate that . When I 'm stringing my guitar I like to work with one string at a time , and this silly double loop makes me leave one string opened up on the bench . Sometimes the strings get crossed over when unlooping them and it makes me mess with the strings for a while . They are trying to save packaging , and that is a good thing . But seriously , that little paper would n't kill anybody . I also do n't care for the color coded rings on the strings . Lucille has an open bridge where I can see those electric colors . It is a small thing , but I do n't like it . I prefer that the rings all be brass , one color . Yeah , I 'm the only one that sees that problem . If I work one string at a time from an individual envelope , the color coding is not necessary.These are fine strings . They are a great price and provide a little bit easier bend .	1
Bought this so my mommy can sing karaoke on YouTube . Also my cousins use it when practicing before using the condenser microphone before home studio recordings with my focusrite 2i2 interface . my cousin and I can perform live at house parties and events so as to entertain the crowd . So it was something that was necessary . and not waste of money or an unwanted item . Also i do n't really have to use headphones because it is a dynamic microphone which reduces loop back when using skype or playing video games and talking to your friends , so now i can listen through my speakers .	1
I put this pickguard in a MIM White Blonde Stratocaster , and guitar looks so great . I did n't need any kind of adaptation to put in my guitar .	1
I 've tried these out in head-to-head ( excuse the pun ) runs versus Steelseries , Plantronics , Panasonic , and Sony headphones that all cost more ... and the Tascam TH02 keeps up ! I 'm really surprised at how well they perform . Lows are good , mids are clean , and highs are crisp . Yes , the lows could be a bit beefier , but out of the headphones I compared it to , only the Plantronics excelled in that area.For fit : I have a large noggin ; like , size 7 5/8 hat . And these headphones fit well ! Not too tight , snug , but not confining . The padding is good and soft.Seriously , I 'd rather buy three of these and burn through them if they break ( which they have n't , and I 've taken them everywhere ) than spend $ 100 on another set .	1
Super cool pedal with tons of applications . it sounds great for recording . i would n't take it on a tour or anything , it is plastic . the harmonizing function can be buggy at times . the trem function works great . it has a input for an expression pedal and i would recommend using one to save your pedal the wear ... ... it is plastic . I love Behringer pedals , for the price you can get a ton of great sounding and functioning pedals at more than half the price of the Boss counterparts . one of my favorite pedals of all time .	1
Well-conceived , spring loaded slot holes multiple picks . It is small and can be affixed ( self-adhering ) to the guitar near the bridge so you always have picks handy when you are ready to play . Inexpensive solution and quite handy .	1
Love these pedals good buy	1
I have several overdrive pedals , some of which are much more expensive than the BOSS SD-1 . For a long time I overlooked my SD-1 and used other pedals . But when I went back to trying the SD-1 , I was pleasantly surprised to find that this relatively inexpensive pedal is superior to some of the pedals I had been using . I do n't mean merely that it 's `` very good relative to its price '' ; I mean that it 's `` very good -- period . '' It easily outclasses some pedals for which I paid much more . The price for this pedal sometimes goes down to about $ 45 on Amazon . At that price , it 's an amazingly good deal . Note : This is definitely an overdive pedal ; it will not deliver metal distortion ( at least not by itself ) . If you want to ride the crazy train , look elsewhere ( like Deltalab 's Metal Distortion pedal ) . What this produces is smooth old-style overdrive . It 's excellent . It sounds especially good through a dash of chorus . I plug my SD-1 into a Fender Mustang II amp and turn on the amp 's chorus ; the result is delicious . I 've used the SD-1 with both single-coil and double-coil pickups . Both sound good , though , not surprisingly , you get a heavier punch with a humbucker . But it sounds great with single-coils too .	1
This arrived a week sooner then expected ! I am very happy with this bag , my Fender LH San Miguel Acoustic guitar fits perfectly ! It is nicely padded and has lots of pockets for anything you might need to carry .	1
Excellent price . Excellent tuner- with one flaw . Using it could n't be simpler , and it has excellent contrast . I would say it was the best clip-on tuner I 've had a chance to use , except that it broke the first time I carried it in my gig bag to a rehearsal . One of the little fingers that holds the `` ball '' in the `` socket '' on the back of the tuner broke off , so the tuner and the clip are now separate pieces . This model works only by vibration unlike the red one , so without the clip , it is not very useful ( it is possible to hold it against the head stock and still use it , but it is n't very convenient ) . I would just super-glue it together at a good angle , but I have to put it in different positions on different instruments . I 've seen a number of complaints elsewhere about this same problem , so I would call it a design weakness.Despite the negatives , I would buy another if they beefed up the construction or sold it with a hard protective case.Update 4/4/13 : Added back a star . I 'm still managing to use it after hobbling together a fix involving a rubber sink washer . Even with a slightly compromised mount , it continues to provide excellent results . I recently purchased a replacement , the SN-8 ( B ) , but found it really disappointing . So much so I may send it back . I also tried a Planet Waves Mini Headstock Tuner , which no matter how much I try , I simply can not love . So I just ordered another one of these . Despite the ball socket issue , it is still one of the best tuners I 've ever used . For the money , I can afford to keep a couple on hand .	1
Without going to extremes and spending two-hundred bucks on an NOS tube from 1957 , I recommend for us frugal individuals to go the cheaper route until you get your first platinum hit.JJ 's tubes are well-trusted and have become the defacto standard when selecting quality and tested reliability.BTW - 12AXT and ECC83 are the same tube.I ca n't remember the last time I had a JJ tube go microphonic beyond control.I have played full time for over 27 years . I use these.Hope this helps .	1
This was my first strap . It looks good , feels pretty strong , and it is difficult to strap to the guitar . By being difficult , I mean it takes some time to squeeze it to the buttons , and it holds on tight . This makes me feel safe having my guitar suspended about three to four feet above the ground . You ca n't beat the price either !	1
I agree with all the other 5 star reviews , the quality of these strings is excellent.They last with great tone for a reasonable time , and do n't break.I just have a helpful hint for those people with little experience in re-stringing an acoustic guitar that has removable bridge pins . Put a crimp or bend in each string about 3/4 of an inch or so from the ball at the end , about 45 degrees from the straight portion of the string , fairly sharp . Just beyond or just on the wound portion that holds the ball on . Then push the ball into the hole and make sure the crimped portion of the string is slid up against the wall of the hole closest to the neck of the guitar , out of the way of the pin . Then slide in the pin and make sure the ball is not resting on the bottom of the pin ! The pin should fit tightly into the hole , and the crimp you made in the string keeps the ball on the side of the pin , not below it . Each pin has a groove in it where the string passes into the hole on the side of the pin . After pushing in the pin , you can pull on the string in the direction of the nut , and the ball should be pressing the pin sideways in the hole , keeping it tight . It may be under or on the side of the bridge inside the guitar , but I ca n't see in there to verify this is so , but I know that the ball is pressing sideways on the pin ! Not upward.Hope this helps some novices , I had to learn it this way myself .	1
You can find `` cheaper '' ones , but sometimes the Schallers are same price if not cheaper . These are the best design of lock in my opinion and will hold up to years of abuse and use . I 've had several sets for 13+ years and use them without hesitation .	1
I bought a new guitar & got it a day before my fingerease was delivered . My fingers were squeeking & sticking on the strings & back of neck , BAD ! ! After applying fingerease no more squeeks & much easier to move up & down the fretboard ! ! This stuff has been around for years.1st time I saw it was 40 years ago.Ca n't argue with that track record ! ! If you never used it get a can , you wo n't regret it ! ! Joe	1
Maybe it 's because I cut my musical teeth on Motown and 60s rock , but I 've always preferred the sound of flatwound strings to round wound , or even ground wound strings . It might also have something to do with the fact I play upright as well . Flatwounds are easier on the fingers of both hands , and they have a natural damping that makes them sound more upright-like to my ears . It does n't hurt that a good set of flat wounds will last practically forever , too . I use D'Daddarios on all my my electric guitars and basses as I 've found them to be very consistent from set to set , and the sealed plastic packaging means that I can buy a set today , put it in my case , and it 's be as good as new a year later.I used to use LaBella flats on my fretless , and then switched to Thomastik Jazz Flats . Then a friend told me he 'd switched from the Thomastiks to these . He found them much more consistent in quality , and smoother as well . I 'm now a convert , too .	1
This is a great little tuner . Used it for more than a year with no issues . Fantastic for positioning it anywhere on the guitar . It also has an excellent display for showing you how sharp or flat you are . The only reason I did n't make this a five star rating is that I discovered the Planet Waves PW-CT-12 NS Mini Headstock Tuner . If it was a choice between the 2 , the Planet Waves wins , hands down . But this is excellent for what it is : an easy-to-clip-on tuner that can be used on any instrument . I 've even set it down on my elementary classroom autoharp and it tuned it to perfection .	1
I think many/most guitarists are always on the lookout for new things and picks are and easy and cheap thing to try . My favorite picks for the last ~8 years are Snarling Dogs Brain Picks - they 're nylon picks that have a raspy `` cat 's tongue '' surface that makes it super easy to grip.I 've also had a few of these Gator Grip picks for a few years now and I like them quite a bit , but they 're not my favorite . I tend to use something around or just under 1 mm for electric and a bit less than that for acoustic . These picks have a matte finish which makes it easy to retain your grip on them . Sound-wise I do n't find that they 're significantly different from any other pick . If they ever stop making Brain Picks these could very well become my # 1 .	1
Very nice quality , inexpensive guitar strap . A little tough to get on ... . that just means it 's not going to come off with use , just make sure it is all the way on before you start using it ! Using this on my Ibanez ART100 electric guitar . The pick pocket is a nice extra .	1
I 'd first like to say that I bought this guitar on Amazon for about $ 65 , a lot cheaper than it 's being sold now ( currently $ 111 ) . It 's a wonderful guitar for an inexpensive solidbody , but it looks a little different than the picture would lead you to believe . For one , the guitar does n't have a `` finish , '' not even a glossy clearcoat -- it 's solidbody wood , sanded smooth and given a deep wood stain . Secondly , the guitar is pictured as being much lighter in color than it actually is . The photo shows it looking almost like a red colored wood ; in reality , it 's a much darker , deep brown , akin to coffee.This does not , however , affect its playability , which is wonderful . I have a bit of buzzing on one fret , but that can easily be fixed with a good sanding and polish . The guitar can also be strung and tuned easily , though with any guitar of this body style you 'll have to continually tune-and-retune until the strings will keep a tuning . It 's a very heavy , sturdy guitar , and for a solidbody with two humbuckers you 'll likely not find one that sounds as meaty and smooth .	1
I 'm a fanatic about my frets looking shiny and polished . I want them to be slick when I bend notes . If you polish too hard or too often with steel wool , it can wear down your frets . These micro abrasive sheets do a great job without harming your frets . I watched a Youtube demo and that sold me on ordering them . I think Amazon had the best price .	1
Pretty basic capo , goes on and comes off easily . Fits quickly and tightly , I expected a firmer grip but it works well anyway . Good price !	1
The adjustable tension is a great idea and the open/close lever is designed in such a way that it sits behind the guitar neck and wo n't get in the way of your hands ( unlike the capo I had before this one ) . It even comes with a handy pick holder ! I could make this review longer , but what else do you really need to know ? If you have a non-classical 6 string guitar , acoustic or electric , this guy should do the trick , regardless of neck shape . Its a very well designed capo !	1
I got this by mistake , confusing it with the tremolo effect . But , either way , I liked it and decided to keep it . It 's a really good deal at the price . And it sounds just as good as major brands . The only problem most people find is the material that it 's made of . It 's like a hard plastic , not metal like most are . But , if you 're not a person who abuses your gear , it should last you a good while.I can not use it for recording , because there is some hiss from it , like all other Behringer pedals , and I record direct , not through amp . But , for live playing , it 's great . It 's especially perfect for garage and bar bands .	1
I 'll start off by saying that I 'm a proud owner of : - Gibson ES125 Acoustic/Electric- Pono MSD-E- Blackheart BH5H- Blackheart BH110- A Weber Vintage Series 10A125 ( 10 inch , 8 ohm , 30 watts ) in an open back , solid pine cabinet- A Jensen Mod 10-50 ( 10 inch , 4ohm , 50 watts ) - All tube Fender Tweed ChampNow that you know the gear I have , what I can play through an amp , and what I can plug an amp head into , I 'll sum up my review with this : What you get out of this amp is completely dependent on your speaker cab , the cables you use , and how clean your power is . Got good gear ? This little amp will sound great.The DetailsThe amp itself is tiny . I have an Electro-Harmonix pedal that 's bigger than this amp ! Still , it packs a punch . With the gain at about 1/3 up and the volume at half , I get great clean tone and enough volume for a small venue . Crank the gain up more and it gets louder and more distorted as you go . Yes , this little amp will go from Jazz & Country to Rock & Metal with a twist of a dial.The line in and headphones jacks are a nice touch that none of my other amps have . If you want to quietly play along with some tunes , you can . Practice time just got better for your neighbors.The one lone tube in the Micro Terror is the pre-amp tube . Mine came stock with a JJ Tubes 12AX7 . I understand that 's standard . A JJ is nice , but it will *not* warm up this little hybrid enough for you to get even a whiff of tube tone . Dig out an old Phillips , RCA , Sylvania , or GE to get this guy to sound a bit like its big brother . I had an old GE made in Great Britain lying around and popped it in my Micro Terror : warmed it right up ; cleaned up a bunch of high-end tinniness.Still , compared to my two-tube BH5H or my all tube Champ , this guy does sound more solid state than anything . BUT , compared to a buddy 's Roland and solid state Ampeg , it 's downright mellow.No effects loop means that your time-based effects ( reverb , echo , chorus ) can get noisy . So , if you like pedals , stock up on 9 volt batteries to avoid power adapter noise add in.Speaking of power adapters : a previous reviewer is right . The external power brick for this guy seems fragile . I 'm not a fan of the thin line from the brick to the amp . It 's holding up , but one round with my cat and I 'll be looking for a new power supply.The RubAnnoyance # 1 : One cheap cable anywhere in the mix will result in annoying HISS even at low volumes . I found that out quickly . So , get a proper speaker cable and a high end instrument cable or you will hate this amp . I 'm running it with a GLS 12 gauge speaker cable and a Planet Waves American Stage instrument cable - both available here at Amazon or any good guitar shop.Annoyance # 2 : This is a 20 watt amp , right ? WELL ... if you do n't run a 4ohm speaker , you wo n't get all 20 watts . The Micro Terror self-adjusts to the power needed to drive your speaker by stepping down output . ( Yes yes ... do n't quote physics to me . ) At 8ohms , I still get good volume . But at 16ohms ( like my BH110 ) it sounds like a 5 or 7 watt amp . That said , I 'm actually a fan of the tone I get with my 8ohm Weber in its pine cab . The 8 inch Jensen speaker in my Champ , while nice , ca n't put out the low notes like I 'd prefer and the Jensen Mod 10-50 is TOO clean . But the Weber 10A125 sounds fantastic to my ears ; even with the loss in volume.Annoyance # 3 : The Micro Terror is so small and so light , it 'll tumble right to the floor if anyone kicks your chord . Unlike a nice 20 pound amp , the chord wo n't pull out . So : BE CAREFUL.Mitigation for Annoyance # 3 : The all steel chassis can handle a tumble from three feet up onto hardwood floors ... though , it will gouge your floor.And then there 's the standard annoyance that comes with owning any guitar amplifier : if the power is noisy or ungrounded , you will wind up with hiss no matter what . I always carry a Monster HTS 350 and run my amp through it ; that REALLY helps in cleaning up signal noise . ( If you do n't have one , get one . The 300 & 350 are cheap and they work . ) The SummaryAfter all that , I can still say : I love this little amp ! I 've gigged with it and it sings well . Plus , the added gag of tiny ukulele + tiny amp always draws a laugh ... until I crank the dial over and shred some faces.For the price , you can likely afford to pick up $ 40 worth of guitar/speaker chords and wind up with a healthy rig . And , for the price , this is a solid 4 star amp . I know I 'm happy .	1
I own lots of hosa cables they are cheap and quality is there . I 've only recieved one bad cable out of around 50 or so . I use a lot of these guys and if they work when you get them , they hav n't failed yet .	1
I am running 4 big speakers it is working fine not sure it it is 1400 watts but runs a pair of 750 peak super pro 15 inch speakers and a pair of 12 road gear subs so far I get a big punch aout of it . I tough I had to buy two of this but one works fine . I am running a dj karaoke system . I also got a pyle pro 4 channel mixer and they work fine get cables it only comes with power cable . item received looks diferent I say better .	1
Something about EB Strings , they really are `` slinky '' - whatever that means . They have a cool vibe and make my guitars sound better . Plus they are a little easier on the fingers than the other big brands .	1
This gig bag is assembled with quality fabric and awesome construction technique . Definitely far superior to any of the other gig bags that I'v ordered for tenor and baritone Uke in this price range .	1
As with all Boss products , I 've been very happy . The tuner is easy to use ... need I say more . I 'm from the olden days of the 440 tuning fork for tuning , so this is GREAT !	1
It is fine strings , i could n't really find difference between martin m140maybe its just me , i expected more than that ! its just regular strings	1
I recently purchased this ukulele from a local Guitar Center . When i first got there i was looking at the Lanikai brand , but when i picked it up it was so light and thin that I felt like a strong wind could tear it apart . Then I saw this one . It has a little bet of weight and had a fuller sound than the other ukes in my price range . I have already learned the basic chords and ca n't wait to become proficient with this instrument .	1
I 've been playing guitar for years and lately I 've been wanting some slinkier strings so I can get a little more bend out of them . I thought I 'd try these out and I loved them . After playing with these for a week I loved the way that they played and I loved the way they sound . So I ordered 6 more packs of these . The extra slinky strings are fantastic and you definitely wo n't find a better set of strings for the money .	1
The Planet Waves Guitar Rest works for ukuleles ! I just got one , and have used it for a few days , and it 's the bomb ! I can set my little ukuleles down now without fear of falling over . This product is a rubber disc with small `` arms '' in a gentle curve that nestles against the edge of any surface , and you can set your instrument against it , and voila , it does n't fall over ! Here at home , I use it on the second shelf of a bookcase , and my concert sized ukulele fits like a glove , heel on carpet , neck in Guitar Rest.I 'm going to buy a couple more for my ukulele cases , because I can use them at one of my uke parties . If one sets a tiny ukulele on the floor , for instance , to take a whizz , they 're just small enough to go unseen and have someone step on them . Here , I just find a spot near wherever I 'm sitting , and it becomes my `` lean '' spot , and I can even set my beer can on the round part on the back ! Coaster uke/guitar holder . It 's quite immovable once it has some weight against it from the instrument . I could carry a metal stand with me , but it would n't fit in my ukulele case -- this Planet Waves product does . A winner .	1
These Danelectro pedals are great quality for the money . I use this pedal behind my dirt pedals for added flexibility and bringing out some more `` brilliance '' to the tone . The case is plastic , not very attractive , and perhaps not very sturdy . Also the button to push down for the effect leaves a bit to be desired -- it does n't feel very solid . But I intend to use this more for recording than live use , so I 'm not worried about that . Anyway , there are n't many EQ 's on the market , and for the price , it ca n't be beat . I would recommend it .	1
These strings are n't anything fancy , but they sound great . A good old standard that I 've used since I was a kid . And this is the best price I 've found .	1
This product does what it is designed to do , very very well . It is not used very often but when it is , it works beautifully .	1
It 's not fancy , but it 's well though out , and you ca n't beat the value . The edges do n't cut your neck , and having adjustments at both ends allows you to adjust it exactly how you want . Like others , I had to unstitch the pick holder pocket in order to provide a greater range of adjustment . The foam position is never a problem as it will slide where you want , and it flexible/thin enough to go through the buckles if needed . Excellent no frills product with good enough cushioning for a bass .	1
They work well , but they are not Mogami.That being said , I use them in my rig , and bought some for my brothers . We both seem pretty happy with it .	1
This one sounds a bit nasal , and thin on guitar . I tried it on bass , and it gives you that big raw , ad thick stoner metal bass sound . I like it !	1
I keep all my guitars in my room and I had to many stands cluttering it up . The screws they sent with were plenty long enough and all three that I got are holding guitars to the wall , on drywall nonetheless . So given that if you have a wood wall you should have no problem . They all are sturdy enough , and i have always been suspect of wall hangers . best deal and does the job .	1
does n't last as long or sound as bright as Elixirs but these are half the price . Good bargain though for $ 6.99.sounds all right to me , bright and well balanced sound.My little brother ca n't tell the difference since he 's new , but it works well on his guitar .	1
I have a rose-gold plated flute , and wanted something to clean it that would not rub away the plating . This does the job perfectly . Wipes off fingerprints & smudges easily , and with a little water cleans up lip stuff that gets stuck on my lip plate . Is easy on the plating and very gentle . Washes in the washing machine on handwash with no fabric softener and line dries . Am very pleased .	1
This tremelo pedal works nicely and it 's great when you 're playing through an amp without tremelo . Problem solved ! The price was also very good .	1
My go to strap , be it brown or black , Just plain tool leather , ca n't beat itTakes sweat and breaks in great , always well made .	1
used for my guitars also great for adjusting intonation on a guitar ... used on open tunings and bass as well as my Mandilin ... ...	1
My son uses this winder and cutter frequently to change his strings on his acoustic and electric guitar . It has n't failed him yet . It 's easy to use and cuts the strings precisely and cleanly . He says it 's a must have if you maintain and change your own guitar strings . Highly recommend .	1
This is a very high quality Slide and really serves the purpose very well . Try one ... ... ... ... ... I think that you will love it , if that 's what you 're looking for .	1
I 've been playing guitar my entire life . And I 've tried almost every pick there is . After hearing how great it is , I decided to buy it . It felt really small at first , and i kinda was dissapointed . I put it down , and did n't use it for quite some time . For some reason i decided to pick it back up , and after a few minutes i came to like the pick . Days after using it , i got accustomed to its size , and I became much more efficient with picking . And I no longer had to worry about the pick slipping . I ca n't really go back to normal sized picks now.. haha . That 's like the only downside I can think of . There are many dif versions of this style , so buy em all , and try em out . If these do n't work for you , you can always buy the V-pick .	1
Takes you hours to play around with all the sounds . Built in tuner and added foot switch makes it good for stage . Nice and loud in a small package .	1
Great slap echo sound . Do not buy this with the expectation that it will act like a digital delay- it 's closer to a reverb . It provides an echo sound similar to if you were playing in a room covered in tile ( an old engineering trick ! ) . Great for old school rock and roll , rockabilly , chicken pickin etc . This will fatten up the sound of a dry amp . As with all FAB pedals , I find the knob placement slightly annoying , but at this price point you ca n't really make a justifiable complaint . Construction quality is somewhat cheap but the knobs feel solid and it has not failed me in more than a year .	1
For the price and free shipping , this ca n't be beat . It 's heavy weight , solid construction , and very stable . Pay attention to the warnings . If your guitar has polypropylene finish , which most do , you 're going to be fine . If you have a very high end guitar , this might not work .	1
I 've been using these Fender straplocks over the last year : Fender 099 0818 300 F Straplock ChromeThe problem with those is that they use screws to secure that part that is on the strap itself , and the screw will slowly back itself out and you get yourself a disaster . I 've decided to try these because they use a `` dual '' system : you can use the lock on your strap , or just use your `` regular '' strap without the locking mechanism . I 've only been using these for a week , but so far , I like them much better than Fender 's . I think I will replace all Fender straplocks with these.I do agree with the others on the fact that the screws are of lower quality , and the screw heads will strip if you 're not careful . When I was installing these strap nuts , I screw in a half turn at a time , and applied lots of pressure so that the the head wo n't strip . If you can get over the installation , you got yourself a pretty good locking strap .	1
Sweet `` twangy '' sound that is a flash from the past of steel lap guitars . I have a ceramic and this steel slide . Each has a unique sound . The steel as expected has more of brighter twang . When I change my strings , I know that I 'll get some differences in tonal quality , but hey , experimenting for that sound that reaches us is what keeps all of us buying new toys .	1
Joyo continues to surprise me . This thing is all metal , looks very sleek , is true bypass , and all around works well.The individual bands actually light up , which is pretty cool.The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars was they forgot to drill a hole for the power indicator led left of the footswitch . You can see the led on nearly every other Joyo pedal for an idea of how it should look . However it does n't even show up in the product picture on amazon . It was n't a big deal , I just drilled a little 1/8 & # 34 ; ish hold and it fits through .	1
This is a great guitar case and a great price . I bought it to keep my Fender Strat in and it works great .	1
It 's so much easy to deal with your guitar using this string winder and cutter ! A w e s o m e !	1
This cable is a great cable for the price.Flexible , good tone , good quality.I move around alot on stage and I need cables that will keep up with me and not bind up.Great product	1
It had been a while since I had some EB 's . Best packaging I have seen and for the price , do n't order just one pack . Very pleased , always have a spare pair in your case .	1
Great picks , buy it . This pick , rocks for me , im a fan of dunlop for many years and all there products are amazing .	1
Using this to mic my Mesa Boogie Mark V 1x12 cabinet . It is holding a Shure SM57 microphone . The microphone clip that came with the stand is plastic , but I 'm using the one that came with the microphone which has metal threads .	1
The best non-rackmount reverb I have ever had . So many options , clean , transparent , and whisper quiet . This is the last pedal at the end of my pedal board chain . The Toneprint option is great as well to create and personalize your own verb . Excellence once again from TC .	1
I usually use Gibson Vintage Nickle Strings on my electric guitars but when I had an opportunity to try theses strings out I jumped at the chance . I put them on a Gibson Les Paul Goldtop guitar with P-90 pickups . I had no trouble installing them and they tuned up pretty quickly without a lot of stretching needed . They had some great & # 34 ; spank & # 34 ; and sounded great . Easy to play ( they almost seemed thinner than advertised - they play like 9 's but sounded like tens ) . I am really happy with these and will probably buy them on occasion instead of the Gibson strings . Next I want to try a set on a Strat and see how they sound - I suspect they will sound and play great !	1
I LOVE this mic as an indoor studio mic . I would not use it in a location with a high level of background noise as it is omni-directional and picks up quite a lot of extra noise . But when the conditions are quiet like in a studio , this mic ROCKS . Clean , warm sound that picks up natural bass really well . Good for vocals ( singing ) , or instruments like a guitar or piano . Also have used it for some minor podcasting and it worked very well for that too ! Comes with a dB limiter ( -16dB ) switch , right on the mic . Works really nicely at limiting background noise.I would highly recommend this especially at the price . Comes with a decent hard case and SWEET shock mount . Very happy overall .	1
I use this in my recording studio to allow musicians their own level of monitoring in their headphones for recording and playback . So far I 've had this item for about a week , and it has worked flawlessly , and given the exact results I needed . Musicians love being able to control their own headphones , rather than having the engineer in the control room raise and lower their levels .	1
this has a good weight , nice connections , and all together fender charm . pretty decent price compared to GC as well	1
I bought these for my music class . The teens really liked the colors to choose from , and I like the price !	1
You need this to get the most out of your Super-Champ XD amp . The only way that i can see an improvement is to make the end pcs out of aluminum instead of plastic . No telling how long the switches will last ? Fender tends to make good products . Price isnt too bad but this item should come with the amp IMO .	1
I 've read its not really complete isolated , but it does the job . I did n't realise how much noise my one spot was adding . I A/B them both one after the other and it truly was quieter . the only Problem I have is my TC Helicon takes 12 volts input but 300MA . this pedal only supplies 100MA so the pedal did n't work in the 12 volt slit . Luckily however it does work plugged into the 9volt 300MA spot so im using it there . everything else in the other 9volt 100MA slots.it 's a lot quieter now . I recommend trying it and saving some cash .	1
I do n't know if its me , but i cant get any clean sound when this pedal is on , i use this for booster , really sounds good ! use it too when i want to get feedback from my amp.also it comes with an anti slip sticker that you can put underneath the pedal.i recomend this one .	1
I get a lot of grease on my guitar from lotion , sweat , fingerprints , dust , what have you ; I take some of this , spray it on a cloth , give it some elbow grease , and my guitars are shiny as the day it was made . I use it on my acoustic and electric guitars . The bottle lasts pretty long cause the mist is pretty fine . I use two sprays on the cloth for the front side of the guitar and then repeat for the back . It has a fresh lemon scent . I recommend this to everyone , a lot of product for an affordable price .	1
Once I switched to these cables I never use anything else now . Great connection sounds good and no issues at all .	1

Du Du .Duh Duh ! Hendrix , bro.This arm fit my Mexican Strat perfectly . I then sold it to a beginner guitarist for a great price . I firmly believe that this small investment of vibrato arm greatly increased my return . The only problems is that I 'm not sure I can afford to pay the capital gains tax for all the profit that I made on my guitar investment . I might have to sell one of my Lexuses.. Lexi.. what the hell is the plural of Lexus ?	1
This pedal is awesome . I use it the most of all my pedals , because it 's pretty much perfect . I can get 4 completely different sounds out of it . It 's also true-bypass , so it will not effect your tone when it is off . It 's much smaller than the big muff pi , which is good because it takes less room on your pedalboard . Just to let you all know , this is NOT an overdrive or distortion pedal . It is a fuzz pedal . So do n't buy it expecting overdrive . Also , when it 's turned on you will hear a hum , but the web says that it has to do with flourescent lights , and muff pedals hum alot . None of that makes me dislike the pedal . It 's one of the hest fuzz pedals ever . I use it in front of a wah , and that 's all I 'll ever need to use pedal-wise . Get this pedal ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
It 's as good as it looks . With that in mind , it 's perfect . It 's not very sturdy if you 're using it outdoors and it 's windy but hey , what do you expect from the way it looks ?	1
See my previous evaluation on a similar product . It is all a matter of how large you want to chord chart to be .	1
they look slick and work really good , i would recommend this to anyone that needs a bass drum patch or so	1
This power supply works awesome with pedals and mini amps without giving you that static hiss you get from some other brands .	1
It 's comfortable . It 's adjustable . The color was a good match for the guitar . Unless you regularly gig for hours at a time , why spend 50+ smackers on a strap when this one does just fine ? Put the dough into the guitar , not the strap . By several colors for whatever look you are going for at the time .	1
For 10 bucks it 's a great piece . Works well on my acoustic guitar and acoustic bass . Battery IS included , but it is very small and almost lost it .	1
This is a pretty decent guitar . If you can get past the brite orange color of the sound board . Was disappointed that the electronics are a tuner that you have to switch from string to string ( why would they put a tuner in this six string guitar , that is made for a seven string ? ) and a volume nob that goes from low to high . No tone control , no presence control . Hint : Do n't go to guitar shops and play a better guitar than you can afford . It will just leave everything else you can afford seem lacking .	1
Liked the fact it tunes your ukulele as I must be tone deaf and cant use pitch pipes , , I bought another for my step son . I did have a problem with mine not turning on one time but after re-seating the battery it has not had a problem since .	1
I use this to record my band and other songs into garage band . Plugged right in , no drivers to install , computer recognized it immediately . I am missing out on a lot of this thing 's capabilities by using it only in garageband , but for what I need it for , it 's perfect . I use it to make drum beats and to add tambourine and other percussion instruments for our tracks . I researched a ton before I bought this one . Touch sensitive keys are great although they are mini keys . I could have got a lot better midi controller , but for the money , this one suits my band 's needs just fine .	1
The only solid white leather strap I could find that did n't have any ornamentation . It is of average quality but for the price I was n't expecting much . It looks nice and is mostly comfortable on my black Ibanez RG550XX .	1
It 's amazing how it makes a electric guitar sound just like an electro-acoustic guitar . It 's very useful when you do n't want to carry two o three guitars , or when you ca n't buy an acoustic one . It 's the best !	1
I use this for Video Exchanges on a guitar instruction website . It 's perfect for vocals , podcasting , video recording and so forth . Shure makes excellent stuff . What 's also great is you save some money as an XLR cable is included . I 'm very happy with this purchase .	1
These are great strings . Nice bright tone . The three pack was the best deal when I ordered them . Get some !	1
This is the newer version of the original Snarks . I have bought the red , blue and older black models . These are great . Fast and reliable , and accurate . This new `` Super Tight '' is a bit faster and is slightly more accurate than the others , but the older units are still excellent . The display is a little brighter , but I think the battery life is a little less than the originals . I ca n't recommend these enough .	1
Works great with my Baritone Ukulele . Same quality as my full size acoustic guitar capo . Easily fits in my ukulele case , too .	1
I ordered two of these cables and they arrived on time and as advertised . They are excellent quality , clear tone and a great look . I was actually impressed with the room that the cables gave my tone and the clarity they have . For Price and Quality these are top notch .	1
Order just in time to replace my microphones that were well deserved of retiring . I did n't think that these mikes would give me the quality sound I needed for the price i paid .	1
These guitar picks are just the right thickness and stiffness for comfortable playing . The colors are nice as well . I would recommend these .	1
Nice bright and full sound . Good life , they sound good for a couple of months . Inexpensive . Fast delivery . I am happy with this product .	1
I replaced the tremolo bridge assembly in my Indiana guitar , and what a difference ! ! ! The original equipment spring tension was so stiff that the tremolo did n't even work . Now it sounds great !	1
Nice thumbpicks for banjo . They are size large , so if you generally have a very large hand they will be tight on you . I have a larger hand and they work well , but they are about a micrometer away from being too snug . But I like them a lot . Would also work fine with acoustic guitar picking if that 's whay you 're into ( though I always preferred acoustic picking without a thumbpick ) .	1
Pro Tec manufactures a variety of accessories for musical instruments . Their low cost black nylon guitar strap , is a well constructed high quality item , that is a top seller at Amazon . The large sized attachment tabs are quite thick , about 1/8 inch . Although the fit on the typical guitar strap nuts is snug , some type of strap retainer would still be recommended . Black works with most colors , and this strap should last for a long time , but it is so inexpensive , if you qualify for free shipping , you might want to consider ordering a spare .	1
These picks are really nice if your tastes run in the jazz pick direction . It 's easy to play fast tricky lines with the smaller hard picks . give them a shot	1
Works well	1
Tascam had the first inexpensive multitrack recorder on the market , and even as competitors entered the market they 've managed to stay on top . I 've owned or borrowed models from Fostex and Korg going back several decades but Tascam always seems to be out in front when it comes to ease of use and value . Even as the market evolved from cassette to digital , Tascam recorders have kept the same feel and ease of use . I had a Boss Micro BR-80 for a while , but I found the all-menu interface annoying and difficult to use . I kept forgetting the sequences to set up rhythm tracks , record , and mix down , and ended up having to repeat things over and over . I soon sold it , and then replaced it with a Tascam DP-004 when that appeared on the market . The Tascam was n't really any more powerful than the Boss , and lacked the built in rhythm tracks , but it had fewer menus and more actual switches and knobs that made it more intuitive in use , and more like an actual mixing board or traditional cassette-based recorder.After the DP-004 Tascam produced a follow-on six track unit and this recorder , the 8-track DP-008 . When it was first introduced a couple of years ago it really was a revolutionary unit . There were plenty of 8-track recorders out there , but none that were that small and that inexpensive . It 's also more than just a DP-008 with more tracks . The DP-008 has a much improved mastering ability that allows you to adjust EQ , compression , and effects individually on tracks for the mix down , while leaving the original tracks unaffected . Like the DP-004 , it has built in microphones and can also be used for direct stereo recording . Unlike the DP-004 , it comes with an external power supply in the box ( a $ 24 option with the original 004 ) and can use an external battery pack.I 've been playing with my 008 all weekend , doing a mixture of stereo and multitrack recordings . One thing I noticed right off was that there 's a significant amount of noise in the monitor mix while multitracking . I was afraid this would translate into noisy recordings , but the noise is n't there in the finished playback . I also noticed that while the basic recording functions are more or less unchanged from those on the 004 , the new mixdown functions are much more complex and required constant reference to the manual . As mentioned previously , there 's an awful lot of capability there and it 's going to take some time to be able to use it effectively . Most of that functionality is menu-based , rather than being accessibly directly from the front panel , and I have to say that 's one thing I do n't really care for . The only input device you have to select functions and parameters and menus is a scroll wheel that 's not nearly as comfortable as a knob or a mouse or touchpad.Most of my recording lately has been done with various Apple platforms . At home , I use Garage Band on my iMac and a USB-equipped Alesis console for input . Away from home I use Garage Band on my iPad and ( for ultimate portability ) iPod Touch . All of these platforms are much more intuitive to use than the DP-008 and much more powerful . Of course , they 're also a lot more expensive , and lack the built-in stereo microphones and ability to plug instruments and microphones directly in without some sort of additional interface . Having XLR connectors as well as 1/4 '' inputs is a really nice touch , something you never saw on portables from a few years ago . I like the old-school approach of the DP-008 as well as the all-in-one package approach.If I was just starting out in home multitrack recording and did n't have a lot to spend , I think the DP-008 might be a good choice . It 's really good enough to produce music for a band 's first CD releases , and costs less than a decent microphone . WIth 8 full tracks there 's no need to do track bouncing to get four instruments and four voices down , and if you really need to , you can bounce and add a further six tracks , giving you 14 in all . I do n't think it 's going to replace my iPod for pocket portability or my iPad for functionality ( Garage Band gives me a full orchestra , keyboards and drums as well ) but having the microphones and instrument preamps built in does make it much easier to set up and use for live recording . It should get a lot of use at my home and elsewhere in the coming year .	1
THis system works great ! I have a Taylor 910ce , and two other guitars I use these on - very simple and works great !	1
This is just like any other microphone stand . It works the same and is pretty durable . The weight at the bottom will definitely stop it from falling if someone were to acciddently bump into it ... which is great , but could also be bad if you want to carry the stand around a bit . In order to do that you must either support the weight , which can be a pain or unscrew it from the base . Other than that , it 's great .	1
It can be an octave divider ( up to two up or down ) It can do parallel intervals ( a la Trevor Rabin on Owner Of A Lonely Heart ) It can do intelligent harmonies ( just make sure your guitar is IN TUNE so it can track your playing ! ) It can do Digitech Whammy-esque divebombs ( up or down ) It can do chorus-like detuningIt can do whammy bar flutter-copiesIt 's a BARGAINIt 's very welcome on my pedalboardIf it 's what you 're looking for ( it 's not Lexicon , it 's not TC , nor does it profess to be ) and you know how to use it you really ca n't go wrong.Get one and have fun ! Because it 's not programmable I 'm getting another .	1
For the price , i 'm really happy . It 's my first one i get and it 's perfect , i 'm learning how to use it and it 's not as easy as you guys think .	1
Nice reverb . Can get all of the reverb sounds you want . Got to play with it but I got dialed in easy	1
This is fine for my music room at home where it is n't likely to get bumped too hard . I wish the bottom did n't swivel , because I do n't see a need for it to do that . But it keeps my guitar handy and does the job I wanted it to do at a low price . I like the security strap that keeps the neck from falling out . However , I would n't recommend this for the stage where there are crowded conditions and it is more likely to suffer a heavy bump . For that , you would want a larger tripod at the bottom to make it less likely to topple .	1
Excellent strings . Beautiful solid tone and no buzzing .	1
So , you just spent all your money on a guitar and do not want to spend much more accessorizing . This strap is perfect , even if you do have the money to spend and just looking for something that will do the job well.The materials are 1 ) high quality soft nylon for the strap - it feels kind of like a non-stretch ACE bandage , 2 ) durable non-scratching/marring plastic for the links and adjuster and 3 ) a thick rubber material for the ends.The thickness of rubber material for the end secure the the straps pretty well . They do not slide of the strap pegs very easily . I say rubber like because they seem more like a synthetic leather but with more flexibility . Again this material seems to be non-marring.All this and a secret compartment for picks.Overall , a fantastic product with a price that ca n't be beat . Highly recommended . Five stars .	1
Love , love this guitar.Little bit modify at the bridge will make great guitar.Nicely sound it gave ( up on what brand of strings you use ) .Price also great with budget.Worth every penny.Best recommended for starters , intermediate and pro player.Get it one you will love it .	1
This is the best one out there BAR NONE ! Really , this is a keeper . Wish it came in different neon colors , as it would be really easy to find when you have broken a string on stage . That would make this one the BEST .	1
This is a fairly compact & # 34 ; must have & # 34 ; accessory when working in pit or dim light situations . This music light will easily cover two pages of music and at a stretch , three pages.The LEDs provide bright , white even coverage making it possible to see the pages of music . The heads are easily adjusted with the flexible mounting arms and the two stage light intensity switch is a good feature when a lesser intensity light is desired.The small size of the light makes it perfect for travelling .	1
Quiet and durable	1
I 've been using a Crybaby for going on 30 years now . Some guitarists claim that having them in your signal chain affects your tone in a negative way . Well , I 've never noticed.To me these always feel perfect . Also , you can adjust which part of the sweep you 're using very easily - ie if you want more treble or bass you just the little `` comb '' that moves the wheel on the pot.I 've tried other wahs . Morley does n't do it for me , and the Vox is very good , I just have always gone with what I knew . No complaints with the Crybaby .	1
This is a quality stand . I use it for my Yamaha acoustic guitar and it works great . Nothing but praise for this item .	1
I tried one of these on my violin at a Guitar Center where it 's costs more than Amazon.I think the Amazon price is the best you 'll find.It works as well as expensive tuners . In addition to tuning up the strings , I use it to practice scales on the violin and check my intonation.Be advised though , that it only registers natural notes and sharps . It does not show a readout of flat notes , instead it shows the & # 34 ; equivalent & # 34 ; note . But as violin players know , a B flat is NOT the same as an A # .But it does n't just read the letter of the note your on . The graphical representation shows how close you are above or below it.For ten bucks , you ca n't go wrong .	1
The main reason I bought this tuner and not similar offerings from boss or tc electronics , is because I had read prior to making the purchase that this is the most accurate at low tunings , and me being a bass player and sometimes playing drop A that is a must . I have to say that after owning it for a while I must agree . I 've used other tuners when I happened to not bring this one along and thats been my experience . Also its easy to read which note you 're on when you 're on a dimly lit stage .	1
The best deal for recording beginners . This mic can handle anything from vocal , guitar , drum , to all the other instruments.It 's definitely flat and natural sounding , which I like . Just be aware it comes with a plastic shock mount , not a metal one like the AT2020 comes with . However , it 's usable .	1
Thank you Fender for a really fun instrument that fits my size ... and thanks to all of you that recommended it for just that reason : )	1
everything on a fender should be fender parts - these hold as good as dunlops and are easier to get off with sweaty fingers . these give me more comfort because they are locked on solid and requires a push then pull to come off . I get furious when my guitar comes off the strap so this stopped it and kept the fender mojo going .	1
I installed the Ragin ' Cajun into my Fender Super Champ XD . I read all of the reviews of people saying this speaker turned their Super Champ into a monster and man they were right ! I immediately noticed a difference in the warmth , articulation , and fullness of my sound ! The cleans are warm and ... clean , and the distortion is articulate and fits my needs nicely . I had been trying to play Tool 's `` Jambi '' and the beginning part never sounded right . I always thought I was doing something wrong because of how muddy it souned . Tried the same lick with the Ragin Cajun and it sounds perfect ! I would highly recommend this speaker for anyone that owns a Fender Super Camp XD or needs a 10 inch speaker.Two items of note : 1 ) A few people said this is a bass heavy speaker and I do not agree . While it is slightly darker than the stock speaker , it has a screaming Mid/Low range . A quick turn of the Treble knob from 4 to 6 cleaned up the darkness . 2 ) Do n't forget , the first time you install the speaker will be the worst it will sound . All speakers need to be broken in before they hit their sweet spot . With that said , this thing sounds amazing directly after install . Buy , you wo n't regret !	1
These great little accessories are a nice convenience . The allow a singer to remove the mic from the stand without the normal loud pop from removing it from a wireless clip . This particular model adds a feature that locks the microphone in the desired position ( older models would swivel without much effort ) . Bought 6 to replace to older models I had on stage . They 've worked out great : the mics all stay in position when popped on the straight stands , no spinning . Copasetic .	1
I could n't be happier with my choice to buy this product over the many others listed on Amazon . This was a newly listed item on Amazon when I bought it , ( in fact this review will be the first ) , so I was a little apprehensive about choosing something that had no user feedback , but I 'm glad I decided on this item.I wanted something with several storage compartments , so I could organize all my guitar accessories in the case properly . This bag has six separate compartments for storage - three main zipped compartments , each also with a zipped pocket for smaller items . Perfect ! I also needed some new plectrums and this particular case came with a nice quantity bundled , as well as a guitar strap that I do n't currently require as I already have one , but it 's nice to have a spare now.The padding of the bag is quite thin , but firm , so is more than adequate enough to protect my guitar from bumps during transport and carrying . The two built in `` back-pack '' straps will certainly be useful when traveling with other luggage , and the case also comes with grip sized carry handles both on the front and the side ensuring the guitar can be carried however a user wishes to.If you are in the market for a guitar bag and do n't want to spend a fortune , I would definitely recommend you consider this item . It is perfect for my requirements , and may well be for yours too .	1
I recently purchased two Protec guitar straps in order to avoid having to switch straps between instruments . These straps are quite flexible length-wise , so if you have ever been disappointed by a strap that you either could n't get short enough for a high playing position or long enough for a low playing position , you will not be disappointed here . These are also a nice medium width , so they should be suitable for all kinds of players . Although one reviewer complained about the size of the holes for the strap buttons , I actually find the snug fit to be an advantage : it does n't feel like I 'll have to worry about the strap coming disconnected from the guitar . And , the price is right .	1
Very beatiful and good quality . Nothing bad to say , it 's a Fender strap with the hard rock leather look ! Highly recommended !	1
I expected cheap mic stands missing a few things that more expensive ones had . To be honest , I 'm not missing anything . They have all the features and versatility you 'll ever need . Perfect for what I want to do . They even come with a clamp for your cable .	1
Great picks , good to uses on lessons or situations that you certainly looses it . Very sheep relatives with the quantity .	1
Believe this 5 feet Cable is no small thing . The Jacks are high quality construction . Very very durable . The cable itself is thinker that ordinary guitar cable . I plan on enjoying this Cable for many many years . I 'm glad I bought it , and thanks to Amazon who made it available .	1
I bought this product for only one reason : I have several amps that are not guitar amps , but stereo or PA-type , clean , high powered , two channels , that I want to use as guitar amps , either as the primary or backup . This tube modeler acts first as a pre-amp , and then adds gain , volume control , `` crunch '' , whatever , to the non-guitar amps to make them sound like guitar amps . I do n't really care what tube amps it models , or what mic placement , I just want the guitar amp sound and style . I also use it in front of a Behringer Ultra-G DI box , so that the DI box splits the signal coming from the TM300 and sends half to my non-guitar amps and guitar speakers on stage , and the other half to the house PA . I do n't think that many people would do this.The sound you get out of this box is affected by what amp , and kind of amp you are driving with it , and also what kind of speakers that amp is driving . The acoustics of the space you are playing in also affects the sound , but I 've used this box with all of its settings driving PA amps , home stereo amps , bass amps , and guitar amps , all of which drove PA speakers , bass speakers and Eminence Commonwealth 12 guitar speakers , all in the same acoustic space . Each combination of amp and speaker with all settings on the box held constant , sound different : some more like guitar amps and speakers , some not . As I said , I do n't really care about what tube amp is being modeled , only that I get an authentic guitar and speaker sound out of the box . It works for me.I read reviews that say that this is a digital knockoff of the analog Sansamp GT2 , and based on its performance so far , it has served as kind of like a cheap preview of what the Sansamp can do . I would consider getting the GT2 in the future , but for now this product is , for me , the poor man 's tube amp .	1
The yellow material has a rough texture coated over it that gives it a nice rubbery grip with a smooth snappy tone !	1
It works ! This guitar support could n't be simpler . The neck rest is a molded plastic cup with that soft spongy material inside the neck support . The mat is a thick light weight foam mat ( a bit like a yoga mat ) with a hole cut in it . The neck support cup goes through that hole . That 's it for set up . The mat protects the guitar body . The support cup holds the guitar at exactly the right angle to work on it , change strings , adjust the truss rod , work on the pickups , or clean the guitar . The guitar can be placed in strings up or down.This would n't be a difficult DIY project , but I 'd be missing out on that cool Fender logo if I made this out of wood and a yoga mat . Honestly , this looks really sharp put together.The whole thing comes packaged in a clear plastic tube . That tube is an excellent storage tube .	1
I put these on an Epiphone Les Paul acoustic-electric and it sounds so great . They are very smooth and warm and magical , like a mythical unicorn .	1
I buy these and put one in each of my guitar cases . Bright display , easy to use , works well and cheap . I have bought several of their models . I particularly like the fact that when the battery is dying the display becomes darker but the unit still works correctly . I hate the tuners that give you bad readouts with weak batteries . Had a problem with the pivot joint breaking on one of the older models , but it was replaced without a peep by the manufacturer . Newer models seem a bit beefier .	1
Real nice Guitar Picks . It came in a 6 piece pack , they deserve the Dunlop brandname because these things last a long time .	1
The first power source that is fun . It can take the edge off of a distortion of OD pedal by rolling off the voltage . I have yet to use it with a fuzz but I hear it sound sick .	1
Works as expected . Clips onto pretty much any mic stand . The movable head is awesome .	1
A great little amplifier . Good quality , good built in effects , and is still easy to carry around . I replaced the stock speaker with an Eminence Rajun Cajun , which has improved the tone and provided increased volume . The amp is now capable of being used at small gigs . I would highly recommend .	1
Stuck one in my guitar case to keep it just the right humidity . A must have for us dry Californians .	1
a very recent purchase ... .I have not used it yet so I ca n't say much ... however I have loaded the software on my laptop ... the software has soooo many capabilities its about mind boggling ... ..very good deal for newbies like me ! ! !	1
Got this because I thought the length would be enough . It was , but I wanted more mobility so went to the longer length . Had no problems with this cable though . Works great !	1
I was actually trying to buy the smaller Xenyx when I bought this one , but I 'm so glad I got this model . Unbelievable amount of flexibility built into it . I use with the UCA202 audio interface and the Audio-Technica AT2035 for recording on my PC with Audacity every day since I unpacked it with no problems . Makes a perfect small studio combination !	1
I bought this for my M-Audio keyboard but it also works equally well with my Casio Lighted Keyboard.Just be sure that your keyboard has a sustain pedal connection.This is a very heavy duty unit that feels and operates exactly like the sustain peddle on a piano .	1
I have always loved Hercules products . Their mic stands and guitar stands . They are great quality and very handy , especially this one , for performances where 3 guitars are used .	1
Quick to clip on and off . Really ... Is there anything else to say ? What else do you want it to do ? These suckers are wonderfully reliable.I 've had one for about 10 years . The only thing that went wrong with it was the removable rubber on the `` bottom '' of the capo became damaged because of my own neglect . However , for a $ 1 , keyser sent me a bag of a about 6 of them . Can you go wrong ? NO ! Great product !	1
There are a TON of reviews here , and I do n't have a lot to add . You can read about what this tuner does and does not do in the specs section or from other reviewers who tend to review specs instead of how they like or dislike something . Bottom line , this is my favorite headstock tuner . I also own the new NS mini and it has its own qualities that I like as well ( like being small ) , but it does n't fit on my Godin 's headstock . This tuner , the SNARK , fits on my Godin 's small headstock with no problems . On a dark stage this works great . I love this little tuner . five stars .	1
I 've only used it a few times but this strap looks like it 's here to last . No frills , just a plain black strap .	1
After years of playing , I rather choose this small and strong accessory to take care of my precious guitars and basses .	1
loved this thing , I have since lost it , as happens with little doo-hickeys like this , lol . worked good . pretty precise , meaning you will fight with it to where it is happy . sometimes it felt a little off , but robots know best , right ?	1
Got this for a 15 year old learning guitar . They thought the guitar was fine before the tuner . My , how things change when you can see what is really going on . Recommended .	1
Even though the title says `` Acoustic Guitar Case '' , it 's obvious that this is a case for A-style mandolins . I chose it because the lining looked a little deeper in the photo , and the reviews were good . Sure enough , the lining is soft and well-padded . The hardware works as it should , and the build quality is almost perfect . However , when closing the case , a small amount of jiggling is required to make the top seat on the bottom properly . Just a slight push-pull motion will allow the top to snap in place , then everything is as it should be . The case fits my A-type mandolin perfectly , and provides the protection needed to safely transport it in a car trunk or other place where it will be bumped around . The slight mis-fit of the top and bottom is not a big enough concern to warrant returning the case . It serves its purpose well , at a reasonable price .	1
Does what it says it will do and it does it very well . The connector is a 3/8in female slot so make sure whatever it is you 're buying can connect to that . The mic/boom stand I bought and the on desk stand were both 5/8in male so I had to buy 2 cheap adapters ( 6 $ each ) . I also am having some issues really `` locking '' in the Audio-Technica condenser mic to the shock mount . So far it stays in , but is n't `` super '' secure ( wobbles just a little if it 's moved ) , but maybe I 'm just doing it wrong . Aside from that , though , great product .	1
First wax I have bought . I usually do n't wax . I tend to use cleaning sprays . I am going to be waxing now on . Gerlitz makes this wax easy , not greasy . This tin should last a lifetime . It comes with an applicator designed for contours of guitars . I would use just the minimal amount and still get a mirrorglaze . Leaves no ffingerprints or smudges . My classical guitar sounds better after a dose of the GERLITZ GNO NO 1 CARNUBA GUITAR WAX ! ! ! ! !	1
Anyone who plays a lot know that strings are very much a personal thing . The tonal qualities , weight , feel , materials and all other qualities / variables combine to make strings your very own personal favorite . For me these strings bring it all together and are my string of choice for all 12 acoustic electrics I use to play what I consider rock ballads using my strumming-style of play.I love the feel and tone of these strings for my style of play and my equipment set-up . I do have some issues with these strings , but overall , I 'm willing to put up with the issues for the overall performance I get from the EJ26 strings . The issues include what I think may be premature breakage . I do not play & # 34 ; hard & # 34 ; , I play long ( playing several hours daily ) , but I play rock ballads using a somewhat softer strumming style . ( I definitely do not & # 34 ; pound & # 34 ; on the strings - I like to think of it as fairly & # 34 ; gentle & # 34 ; strumming . ) Yet , I seem to manage to break the high E & B strings on a regular basis ( by playing , not by over tuning ) . Some of this can be expected , but what bothers me is the frequency with which I 'm breaking G strings . I simply do n't think these wound G 's should be breaking at all with my style of playing . I 've noticed that the current & # 34 ; most helpful critical review & # 34 ; mentions this same problem . I change strings frequently so I do n't think this is the reason they are breaking.Overall , I am willing to put-up with what I believe to be some premature breakage ( especially with the G string ) , for the other qualities that draw me to the EJ26 strings . They sound great for my style of play , equipment , and set-up . They feel great . I love 'em and will continue to buy quantities of them for my 12 acoustic electrics . I just wish I had a better feeling about the premature breakage .	1
I bought this because my band 's primary PA mixer does n't have high-impedance inputs for a guitar pickup , and I do n't always want to bring my submixer for quick-change gigs . So , a small , cheap DI box seemed like a good solution.The PDC21 is a no-frills device . It converts a 1/4 '' instrument cable ( high Z ) to a balanced/unbalanced 1/4 '' or XLR ( low Z ) signal . It does a fine job . I do n't notice it coloring the sound ( i.e. , it 's not changing the balance of frequencies transmitted ) although it does lower the volume somewhat . That 's to be expected in a passive DI box , and it does n't bother me.I 'm using it with an LR Baggs M1A active soundhole pickup . The M1A spits out a fairly hot signal , and I do n't have any problem with the signal loss associated with the PDC21 . If I were using a passive pickup in my guitar , the results might be different.Bottom line : it 's small , fairly light , seems durable , and it does a good job converting my active guitar signal to the XLR inputs our PA mixer requires . It does everything I wanted , and the price was right . I see no reason to go shopping for a more expensive one .	1
I received my tuner yesterday very fast shipping , it looks great , the price is right , but most of all it works wonderful , very easy to use and small enough to carry in my guitar case .	1
Onstage makes well thought parts for mounting things.. I use these all of the time for small cameras that are stationary.. I put them on a mic stand and it takes much less room than a full blow tripod.. They ca n't hold a heavy camera very well but a small one they will hold just fine..	1
Although I purchased a Lanikai LU-21 ukulele some time ago , I have not had the chance to play it for hundreds of hours . Despite that , I 've been highly impressed with its quality and sound . As some reviewers note , nylon strings have a tendency to go out of tune pretty quickly and to fret sharp ; however , that 's more of a function of the strings than a function of the ukulele . The Lanikai frets well all the way up the fretboard , although as seems to be the case with soprano ukuleles in general , it tends to sound better and more resonant in its lowest range . The tuners seem solid and all four function consistently and the construction looks to be pretty solid as well . If I were going to be playing gigs , I 'd probably look for a more expensive and presumably higher quality instrument ( and I probably would not purchase it without trying it first ) , but for having some fun , this is a workable and recommended instrument .	1
This little box will give it to you . I personally play bass and I have a thing for long effect chains . I count in my little arsenal with fuzz , distorions , auto wah , a compressor , octaver , bass booster and a nice DI Box . The MXR EQ helps me a great deal to `` recuperate '' definition and clarity after this long effect chains that I love . A great little box.So if you are looking for clarity , definition and even a little extra punch for your sound the MXR EQ will do the trick.Cheers ! ! !	1
I have just gotten all the adaptor snow to make this work . Focusrite was very helpful will problems concerning this . I have only made a few recording but I am going to make a lot more . Very easy to use .	1
Well long story short this is my fourth Vox wah . Others have come and gone , some have been around longer than others but this one is the newest so im still working with it . sounds like the classic v847 but has the ac plug on it , that will come in handy . not as versatile as the JS big bad wah but far less complex and less likely to have issues with dust and dirt . it has a wide sweep and killer tone but im still looking for that sweet spot that gives that wah'o sound when doing solo work . so far so good not perfect but good .	1
Dont use the cheap fog liquid as it smells bad and gums up the system if you leave it in too long.I got this last year for a small party and had the smoke alarm going off in my basement within seconds . This beast puts out lots of fog and does a nice job.It does get hot and drips at the front if you spray for too long but it does do what it 's supposed to . Also note that the cap on the machine does n't seal well and will drip if you angle the unit too much.Keep it away from walls and floors as the oil will collect on them and leave you with a mess to clean up later . It 's best on a stand 3-4 feet off the ground.Overall build quality is very nice . Metal case , compact , nice bracket , lighted remote telling you when it 's ready.The threads on the tank are plastic as is the cap and can be damaged if you cross thread which is quite easy ...	1
A must for every serious guitar player . This is one of the easiest to use slides that I have ever owned & I have been playing for about 45 years . I play mostly classic rock & this slide is a handy gadget to have in your guitar case.This holds up very well because I have a way of abusing a slide . Dunlop does it again .	1
I used this one time so far w/my fishman stick and it served the purpose just fine . am looking forward to using it in the future	1
Leather tends to be stiff and not very flexible . Nylon has incredible strength but is n't very comfortable . In my humble opinion , cotton twill is totally the way to go . It 's comfortable and adequately strong . This strap is sturdy and robust , and it 's plain black . You ca n't go wrong here.Schaller strap locks are compatible with this strap . You should buy those too , they 're great.It gets five stars for being not only better than most other competing products , but also a lot cheaper .	1
Years ago I owned an original edition TS808 ; I loved that pedal and used it for years on stage . Eventually I sold it many years later , but I always missed that pedal , so I decided to give this reissue a try . My verdict : Awesome - It sounds just like I remember . The TS808 just has that 'certain something ' that really brings out a nice smooth overdrive sound , especially when it 's to enhance the overdrive sound you may already have .	1
These on my guitar as a replacement to some old ones and they work well . I have had no problems with them .	1
I was an Ernie Ball guy for a long time . But I was getting pissed because the Ernies kept corroding so quickly . So I tried these , and they seem to hold up better . There are coated strings that will last longer , but I do n't like spending so much on strings . And of course , they sound excellent too . Stock up ! !	1
Tons of useful information on this wheel . My only criticism is that the accompanying manual could be far more exhaustive and more clearly written . Seems like reasonably durable construction . Compact enough to stow it in a guitar case .	1
I bought these to beef up the bottom end of a Telecaster that came from the factory with a set of Fender 9 's that topped out at .042 on the low E , which is just too small for good twangy bass . I 've been using them for a few months now and have n't broken one even though I can bend the high E to touch the D string . I use D'Addarios on my other guitars but tried these Ernie Balls just for the hybrid mix and there is n't a whole lot of difference . D'Addario sells a similar set called EXL125 so maybe I 'll try those next but for now these are good .	1
One thing tho . When your guitar is n't in it is prone to being hit and launching picks everywhere . I am going to be finding picks in my files for years . Put it up on the table when your picks are not in it .	1
I have a collection of guitars that exceeds well over 100 . I have guitars that cost thousands of dollars and I also have some cheapies . Some of the best sounding and best playing guitars are the `` Cheapies '' I 've been dealing with Musician 's friend forever . Rogue is Musician 's Friend 's brand . Music 123 is a Musician 's Friend affiliate and they also sell Rogue guitars . I have several different models of Rogue guitars and I 'm impressed with all of them . The Rogue RA-090 is an entry level dreadnought acoustic guitar which is every bit as good if not better than the Fender Starcaster . Here 's the good part , the Rogue is about half the price of the Fender ! Many people think they want to learn to play a guitar until they get one . Once they realize it 's not as easy as they thought and it hurts thier fingers , they quickly lose interest and the guitar gets stored under the bed to soon be forgotten . If you 're not sure if you 're serious about learning to play , this is the guitar for you . Even if you 're an intermediate to advanced player , you still ca n't go wrong with this guitar . It has a deep rich tone like that of a much more expensive instrument . The finish and workmanship is also like what you 'd find on a more expensive guitar . They look , play and sound great ! Many people tend to shy away from Rogue guitars because of the low price . They figure a guitar that cheap ca n't be much good . That 's where they 're wrong ! You have to actually play one to understand what I 'm talking about . Once you play a Rogue guitar , you too , will become a believer . This is the kind of guitar you can take camping to play around the campfire . If it happens to get damaged or stolen you 're not out an arm and a leg . I love Fender guitars and they are among some of my favorites , but for an entry level dreadnought acoustic guitar , the Rogue is a much better value than the Fender and equal if not better in quality . The Rogue RA-090 comes in a variety of color choices . If or when you decide to sell it , you can usually get back what you paid for it.I give Rogue guitars my highest recommendation and promise you will not be disappointed it you buy one . I 've been playing guitar for 51 years so I should know what I 'm talking about . I do not own stock in Musician 's Friend , Music 123 , or Rogue guitars and I do n't get paid to endorse them . This review is my honest opinion .	1
I did n't do the sound quality test but i have another one of these and it works just fine . I just tested if all the plugs work and they do . If i 'll get some sound problems i will write an update but i 'm confident that it 's going to be ok .	1
I love these pick holders . They 're easy to get on and off . They hold a nice amount of picks . And you get that rock-star feel ( throw picks at the audience ) . A must for any gigging guitarist .	1
These strings are well packaged , and easy to unroll and string on my guitar . I 've had them on two guitars for a couple of months and they hold their tone well .	1
This is a good pedal overall , rare to see a stereo pedal at this price so I took the chance and I 'm pleased . As some have said , the low range has quite a steep slope to it , uncomfortable foot angle . But it 's a big pedal , and the pivot seems to be at just the right spot so I can go to lower ranges with my toes because the action is smooth . I wish the TS jacks were top/bottom instead of side by side , seems it would take 1/4 right angle connectors better . One gets in the way of the other . Or even better if it were a TRS jack so you 'd only need one input . I might modify it for that .	1
This string set offers typical D'Addario quality and value . I use D'Addario strings on all my guitars , mandos and my ancient old fiddle .	1
It might just be my pickups or my strings , but if you set the bass above seven or so , the bass gets fairly fizzy on the E string . The effects loop is useless , and it removes a lot of the character from the pedals , but that 's good news because with this amp you do n't need an effects loop because there is no built in overdrive . So if you ever do use a driven/distorted tone , you should just put a pedal in between your bass and this amp .	1
Costs about 2x as much as some cheap capos , and it 's worth every single penny . THis has a strong clip , yet does not damage my concert or tenor ukulele necks . It won ; t budge once you clip it , and it 's low profile . Made of metal , it should last a lifetime.I took off one star only for one thing : the hand clip portion of this does sometimes get in the way of fretting because it sticks out from the neck quite a ways . Some other capos , like this oneJim Dunlop 7828 Russell Banjo/Uke Capodoes not have anything that you can hit your hand on when fretting . Sometimes I try the Kyser on the opposite side , away from me , the player . But , it seems to still hit my hand on some chords , just different ones . That said , I can work around it , and it 's a lifelong capo of fantastic build and keeps those strings from buzzing at all on all my ukes . If one was to have large hands , as I do not , this interference may be even more of an issue to consider.C ya . Happy strumming . Mahalo .	1
Will hold any guitar that I 've seen . It holds the guitar on the wall safely without having to worry about it falling . It 's also very easy to install . It 's a great price ; and it 's definitely worth the investment . Not only do you not have to have your guitars on the ground , but you save space putting them on the walls , and not only that , but it make any room look even better .	1
I use the chair for guitar , bass , keyboards , ukulele and even cooking breakfast . Lightweight , slightly awkward , but provides good back support.As a right-handed player I practice , both classical and jazz style , with the guitar on my left knee . For the position I use in this chair it is necessary to use the On Stage FS7850B Guitar Foot Rest . I do this to keep my thumb in the center of guitar neck . I can report that I have been very comfortable for long practice sessions.As for the four out of five star review , the price does seem steep when you look at what you get for $ 85 . But it 's a nice design and thank you to the designer . I would recommend it to those who can afford it.As for durability ... .. we shall see . I have had it for three months now and it is still fine . I use it daily .	1
I purchased this when it was on sale during the Christmas season - I figured that for the asking price at the time I could not go wrong.My expectations were frankly low . I had heard nothing but horrible things about Epiphones , with the main complaint being they would not stay in tune . Other complaints included poor overall quality and terrible playability . What I received was the polar opposite : I received an instrument with a strikingly beautiful finish , and one that stays in tune ( amazingly it was close to being in perfect tune when I unboxed it . ) I am not wild about the strings that came stock , but I am a drummer and suffer the same disappointment about heads that ship with new drums . I guess guitarists expect to change strings on a new guitar the same way drummers do when it comes to heads . In the near future I intend to restring the guitar withD'Addario ECG25 Chromes Flat Wound Electric Guitar Strings , Light , 12-52 , which , while thick , should make the instrument jazz-friendly . I realize that flatwound strings will require a new set-up and intonation , but considering how good the guitar is and how relatively little it cost me , the new strings and work will be an investment.Out of the box , though , the action was reasonably low and the frets appeared [ to my novice eyes and fingers ] to be properly dressed . I have already invested in a good - but not great case : Guardian Hardshell Electric Guitar Caseto store the guitar ( I also uploaded a customer-provided photo on this page that shows the case and how well the guitar fits . ) For the record , I use the following amp , which I have also reviewed that is a perfect match to this guitar : Kustom Defender 15 Watt Class A Guitar Headthat I run through aKustom The Defender 1 x 12 Guitar Extension Cabinet for 5H Head.Bottom line : this is a great instrument for beginners and not a bad one for experienced players . The price is right , and the quality clearly shows that off shore manufacturers have made significant improvements over the past year .	1
Seriously , this is a great pedal . I ca n't improve upon what others have said , but I will mention a few points.1 . I use this after the preamp or dirt boxes for a lead tone , or to add more crunch to my Fender Frontman 212 when inserted in the effects loop . It 's run before time based effects ( delay , phaser , etc ) for me.2 . I sometimes use it before the distortion as a clean booster , while focusing one of the sliders to boost a few frequencies.3 . If it gets noisy or `` self oscillates '' after a while , change the battery to a fresh one . Better yet , use an AC adapter.I found out about the last issue after reading a few Harmony Central reviews . Otherwise , it 's been on my setup for about seven years . I take care of my stuff .	1
The One spot works very nicely for a pedal board chain . Everything needed came with the combo , making it ready to go right out of the box .	1
this little guy has help me record with my Apogee One voices and amps , to prevent air-flow shock on diaphragm ... wan na have excellent recordings ? get one !	1
I use this cable between my fender blues jr and a ditto x2 looper , it works great and the angled jack puts less stress on the cable and input jack	1
I got this for use with the Boss DD-20 as a tap-tempo . It does the job well , it 's a little big for what it is , but definitely worth having with a delay pedal	1
I have a gibson les paul that I bought used . When it arrived the fretboard was in good shape , but very dry . I first tried lemon oil and it would work , but in about a week the fretboard would feel dry and have an ashy color to it ( its rosewood ) . So I started looking for another solution and found the Gerlitz Guitar honey.I ordered it and applied it . A few hours later I restrung my guitar and started playing and did n't care for the way the fretboard felt . I think it is because the guitar honey is a little thicker than lemon oil and it felt a little slimy because it was n't completely dry . I decided to give it another 24 hours.The next day the guitar neck looked and played great . It is a darker color than any of my untreated rosewood fretboards and plays like a champ . Bends and slides are smoother than ever.Great product and one that I will continue to use . If you need a quick treatment before a gig or something , I would recommend lemon oil because it dries quickly . But I would use this in every other regular maintenance situation .	1
I like MXR products however I am always Leary of the metal button on pedals because of the possibility of the pop factor . The dyna comp does still equal out my sound from clean to overdrive . A must for pedal boards .	1
This is the new and improved Snark . The display is much more readable and after several months of use display is still bright . I found with other models that the display faded and was not renewed even with a new a battery . The only downside to this one is that the bars on the display are so thick that the string has to be more out of tune before it shows up on the screen . So the display is very readable but not as accurate as prior display screens . However the price makes them a good deal even with their minor flaws .	1
This fender mini guitar stand works great . It has cushin/ padding so my guitar is safe - it 's small but stady . All in all -- Good purchase .	1
I automatically put these on any guitar I own as soon as I buy it , I change strings and toss those white plastic pins . Makes any guitar look so much classier ! I swear there is a slight increase in the richness of the tone too ! Phenominal value , tons of bang for the buck They look SOOOO good on there ... Installed easily in 3 different guitars so far .	1
If you play 12 acoustic you got ta get this one . Just a hair longer on the padded area which is what you need . You can tell them from the 6 string version by the ridges being much closer together on this one .	1
This is a great tuner , I just wish that the clamp was a little bit wider since I mostly have classical guitars and the width of the headstocks can be a little thicker than steel string acoustics or electric guitars . Other than that , works great I like using it .	1
Nice strap for the money . I ordered black but got brown .	1
Its very useful . Looks really nice when you have an electric or acoustic on the stand . very durable as well .	1
It works for what I need ! It arrived earlier than I expected ! Really nice ! My guitar is safe now with this hard case !	1
I bought this to use with a Spider IV 75 Amp , so far it works perfect . Provides effect control , loop control , tuner control , also has volume/wah pedal that works great . You can plug it into the PC and customize everything.Recommended !	1
I am normally a guitarist in my band , but I have found myself at times needing to play the keys also . Having two instruments to play , a pedalboard , and mic stand is a lot of real estate on the stage , so this adapter made things MUCH better for me when I find myself back in that position . Works great with my On Stage Keyboard Stand . If you play keys and are also a vocalist , this is a must ! Worth every penny .	1
My first amp with EL84 's is a totally scratch built older single channel Trinity AC15 , which is based on a Lightning . Initially installed JJ EL84 's after reading so many good reviews about them . They sound great to me ( personal opinion of course ) , and are priced right . Thought about New Sensor Mullard RI 's or Sovtek EL84M/7189 's . Glad I went with the JJ 's , and not looking back . I 'm running 365VDC on the plates and 340VDC on the screens . First set , one red plated slightly . Bought a second set from Doug 's Tubes , Ruby EL84CZ 's ( select matched JJ 's ) . Performing nicely with a stock MIM Strat . Also using a Sovtek 12AX7LPS in the PI spot and a post-PI master volume , just like Matchless .	1
Spend a few more bucks and get a padded one . This one is comfortable for 10 mins then it 's cramp time . Just save yourself the hassle , this one is too cheap to return and while it 's `` OK '' it 's not great for long-term playing .	1
This is a very well made guitar stand . it is stury and strong and light wieght all at the same time . I bought this stand for my sons first guitar but I may have to order myself one as well . for the price this stand just ca n't be bet .	1
It 's really flexible on how you 're planning to put on top of it . The only small con is the top surface , you might wan na get a cheap Ikea board for it so you can throw anything . I put my guitar amp head ( around 40lbs I think ) , and two monitor speakers without a problem . Love it !	1
Great quality casters for the money ! Just as good or better quality than the ones that come stock on most amps . You ca n't go wrong with these .	1
This stand is designed to work on electric guitars , not acoustic or acoustic/electric guitars . The arms that support the guitar are short and not adequate for acoustic guitars . This is however perfect for my LP and SG guitars . I love its size and portability .	1
This is a great guitar for the money ! ! ! ! It has low action and has a truss rod in the neck for adjustments ! The built in tuner works great and plugged up this guitar has a very natural and clean sound . I would recommend this guitar to anyone looking at it ! ! ! ! !	1
Great deal for the price and very sturdily made . Easy to assemble and feels very solid . Way cheaper than I saw in Guitar Center . Im very pleased with this stand . I bought two .	1
I have enjoyed my Protec Strap . I was surprised how well made the leather harnesses are and I have had no issue with them stretching on the strap posts of my Dot Studio . One note would be that these straps are probably better for your lighter body styles - strats , teles , sgs - heavier guitars will tend to start digging into your shoulder after an hour or so . Having the pick pocket is a neat feature . I am just finishing up rebuilding a LP copy and I will be getting another for this guitar net week .	1
Very handy to have . Could peel paper off bottom and stick to guitar ( or something ) to keep your picks close at hand . I have n't done that myself as I do n't want to mess up the finish of my guitar but could see it being handy . Picks fit snug but slide out easily when needed .	1
These cables are flexible without feeling cheap , and have solid end connectors . And , they produce no electrical noise like my old ones do , which is why I replaced them . I suspect these cables will be a round for a long time to come , which was something important to me when making my purchasing decision . These mics cords have solid construction going for them , without the high dollar cost .	1
I 've used this mic with my Tascam US-800 Audio Interface , and PC , to record a high school chorus concert , and have gotten very good audio reproduction from this microphone . I placed one of these microphones as a soloist microphone , and one as a piano/instrument microphone , and have gotten great results from both . The reproduction of the sound was very good . The mic seems very solid in build , and able to possibly take a little abuse , which is good with a travelling recording system , but I definately would n't TRY dropping one , even though they 're a nice metal case , and metal grill . I 'd recommend these mics to anyone looking to get a good reproduction of sound for both vocals , and instrumentals , on a budget . I have yet to try these with micing guitar amps , but that 's my next step , as well as drums .	1
Dunlop slides are nice and smooth with rounded edges , they sound great , they 're indestructable ( so far ) and they 're supremely affordable . I own a few of them . I prefer a shorter one most of the time , but I use this one often , as well.Sure , you can spend more on a slide , but I see no reason to .	1
I have several Snarks . This one is the most basic . All are fast and accurate . I have many young guitar students and the Snark is the first tuner they have no trouble using . I also have purchased several red , blue and the new Super Tight tuner . The Super Tight is slightly faster , brighter and more accurate , but the speed , brightness and accuracy of all Snarks are very , very good . I own many tuners , and clip ons of many other brands . The Snark is by far my favorite . There is no close second .	1
This is the most I 've ever spent on a guitar strap . But I have to say it 's well worth the price . Very comfortable and looks great too !	1
This cable is built to last . Overall it is a great quality cable and it came quickly . What more could you ask for	1
Very versatile power supply and much cheaper than others . This is not true isolated outputs , but it is quiet and that is what counts . I have the Fuel Tank Chameleon and I end up using this because it fits the needs of the pedals on my board the best , mainly because of the 500ma output . Here is a comparison of the JP-02 , Chameleon , and the OneSpot . I have all three.T-REX FUEL TANK CHAMELEON ( 1350ma ) Outputs 1-3 : 9v/12v 300maOutput 4 : 9v/18V 150maOutput 5 : 9v/12v 300ma| -- -- Use 5 OR 6 only , not bothOutput 6 : 12v AC 300maJOYO SP-02 ( 1000ma ) Outputs 1-7 : 9v 100maOutput 8 : DC 9V Maximum output of 500mAOutput 9 : DC12V 100maOutput 10 : DC18V 100maVISUAL SOUND ONESPOT ( 1700ma 9v only ) Daisy Chain Power into 8 pedals not exceeding 1700ma	1
Small light and stays out of the way , it just works . Folds up if needed for travel . I use with Stratacoustic .	1
For the money , this one 's a no-brainer . It 's a one-trick pony , but that 's what it 's supposed to be , and it does its trick very well . Sounds better than the Ibanez or Boss models - warmer and less processed-sounding . Plugged into a solid-state amp , at its lowest drive setting , it sounds like you 're playing clean through a tube amp . Plugged into my '65 Twin Reverb ( not a re-issue , but the real thing ) - WOW ! I just got it a couple of weeks ago , but it looks like it will hold up to gigging without a problem . Do n't be a 'gear snob ' who looks down on lesser-expensive products - the sound is what matters .	1
these strings are great if you need practice changing your strings . these strings last 2 days and then they are dull and lifeless and need to be changed , the high e and the b string tend to break before they even get tuned to pitch , Ernie Ball strings are garbage , the only time I will buy these is if it 's the only thing available , most people like these because they are endorsed by so many musicians that are paid to say that they like this garbage , and even if they do like them they are not your average players that need more than 2 days out of a set of strings , Touring musicians have the guitar tech change the strings after they play their set , and they get an unlimited amount of these crap strings so their guitars always sound fresh , you can spend 4 $ for a set of Ernie Ball or D'Addario every 2 days or you can spend $ 7 for a set of DR strings and change them once a month , or you can spend 10 $ for a set of Elixir Polywebs and change your strings once every 3 months , It does n't make sense to use these crappy Ernie 's unless you are sponsored by EB and have an endless supply and a tech to change them for you like the rockstars ,	-1
it is ok as long as you do n't bump your guitar , else boom , it hits the floor . I do n't trust it and amazon has it way over priced . It will work if you put a nail in it to hold the holder in place .	-1
I tried with with my Macbook Pro with both Mountain Lion and Mavericks . Also with my Win7 x64 machine . I tried it with a variety of MIDI capable gear including trying to update firmware on FX hardware , sending and receiving MIDI PC and MIDI CC , as well as transmitting MIDI Clock in and out . I simply could n't get this to work most of the time . Active Sense used on most Roland products seems to kill it completely.In contrast I purchased the -MU 's Xmidi 1x1 Tab and it works flawlessly and without issue every time I use it.I should have totally returned this product . Instead it 's in a landfill .	-1
Some things are great values , others are cheap . The Behringer is cheap . The clips are cheap . The clip that holds the 9V broke after the first change . The clip that holds the pedal is also cheap plastic . IF you get stuck using batteries , plan on 3-4 hours worth of use . It 's also a noisy pedal . Like noisier than my Dyna Comp and OD pedals combined . Like you will not record with this pedal in your chain unless you want a mountain of noise . If you leave it plugged into your cables , even when powered down , it will eat your batteries.All of those negatives aside , you are paying less than $ 40 for a Reverb pedal that has several usable features . The 63 ' spring is great , the plate is also really good . It also has a worth-the-price-alone `` space '' feature . Also known as shimmer ( a synth playing behind your instrument ) . Paired with a chorus effect , you can get some really cool tones.The RV600 is not without merit , but it is a bargain effect pedal and it has some fun to use features . If you gig or record and need a reverb ... well ... you are n't even looking at this pedal . If you play at home and have a low watt amp that does n't have a reverb built in , this is a good option .	-1
I have had this tuner for about half a year and frankly , I have had enough.The main problem with this tuner is the usability.The tuner has a poor display , is extremely finicky and it does not display the octave of the key.Tuning with it can be condensed into one word - frustrating.The needle is very finicky and jumps all over when ever I pick the strings , especially so when the guitar is much out of tune.The poor display is dark , with no build-in light , and has poor visibility at angles too . Combine all that you have a terrible , accurate tuner.Yes , it is accurate but only as accurate as what the graph can display , which is +/-2 cents.Enough said , I bought a new tuner , the Seiko SAT800 , for a bit more money that this.The main differences between SAT800 and the CA-40 : SAT800 has a build-in light , CA-40 does not.CA-40 has a build-in stand at the back to prop it up to a 45deg angle , SAT800 does not.SAT800 has a auto and manual mode , CA-40 has auto.SAT800 displays the octave of the note , e.g . 1E , 2E , etc , CA-40 displays only displays the alphabet , E for all oactaves.SAT800 has a numerical display for the cents off , CA-40 does not.The needle graph on the Seiko is much more stable and it is just way more usable overall.I wholly recommend you do not purchase this tuner . I was fooled into buying it by the other reviewers on Amazon and I hope you would not be .	-1
I bought this to replace a cord I was using to practice my guitar . My first cheap cord was n't actually broken , but I did n't want any down time , so I had this just sitting there as a replacement . Fast forward some time , and I just wanted to try it out . Even though my cheap cord was still working fine , I really wanted to just try out the new cord.I really wish I had done that in the first 30 days . This cord did not work right at all . It seems like there is a short in it somewhere . I had to unplug/plug/ maneuver into place . Of course since it is for guitar , it falls almost immediately out of place again . So , I am back to the cheap cord that has n't failed , unlike this brand new bad cable .	-1
I guess the tension on these is more than my uke was used to and when I put them on the neck became severely bowed after a day or two . Sounded lovely for the first hour , that 's why two stars . Granted my uke is one of the cheaper lanikais , if you have a better built uke it might be able to take these but I simply ca n't recommend personally .	-1
First we have to realize this is not a $ 200 pickup or even a $ 50 pickup . It 's less than ten bucks.It has a specially-designed clamp that is good for attaching it to the sound hole of a guitar . As such it is not going to work for an instrument without a considerable-size sound hole . It also will tend to get in the way of those who play directly over the sound hole , as it is quite easy to hit and will pick up any contact noise.It is more sensitive than cheaper competitor devices . Unless you run it directly into the amp within a distance of 8 ft you are also going to need a 1/4 '' to 1/4 '' coupler ( to allow it to connect to an extension guitar cord ) . You will need such extension as this tends to have significant feedback issues if the amp is too close or facing the guitar.It is a passive pickup , so you will need either an amp with a passive-specific input or a preamp mixer or other preamp device . If you do n't have a preamp system , this will do you no good.So because of the limitations I rate it as above . For what it does though -- providing a passive pickup that can be quickly switched out between instruments , it does okay . I believe there are better pickup concepts out there for about the same amount of money , including adhesive-disk mikes . I would prefer to permanently mount a pickup of some kind and there are many low-cost pickups out there to choose from . But this is a slightly different concept ( removable ) that for the price is worth checking in to .	-1
I bought a set as they were recommended to get the tone I was looking for on my 7 week old guitar . Installed as usual and tuned them . They sounded good when played open but compressing them was nearly impossible . My capo could not even hold them . I set the guitar aside for a few minutes and heard the wood creaking . When I looked the face of the guitar was bowing up and the bridge was pulling up and back as if they were trying to pry it off . I released the tension on all the strings as fast as I could and left it . I returned them and got some lighter ones but to no avail . The body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now . Use at your own risk ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I personally would n't give a nickel for them .	-1
I recently bought a few packs of Jazz IIIs and I was shocked . They do n't play at all like what I was expecting . Under high magnification the edge does n't look the same as the old Jazz III either , and they do n't play the same if you turn them over ! ! ! What 's up with that ? I 'm sorry to give such a poor review to a great brand like Dunlop . Let 's hope this is just a short-term fluke .	-1
This product has almost zero documentation in the box or on the Akai Pro website . Technical support is also almost zero . Akai seems to not care about getting new users up to speed on their products . Customer service is basically `` If you have to ask , you should not buy this '' . I asked the Akai technical department which sequencer software I needed and they told me to go to a Music store ! This may sound stupid but unless you have a lot of MIDI knowledge and experience do n't buy this product . Try finding a MIDI tutorial that is usable . Good luck with that chore.Added 08Nov2010 : The keyboard arrived with one of the bottom rubber footpads missing . I sent an email to Akai asking for a replacement but they do not have any parts . I find that unbelievable .	-1
Bought this years ago . It was a nice long cable that I bought figuring it 'd be durable but it did n't last . Maybe it was my mistreatment of the cable but then again it should be built to gig ... If I was better with wiring I 'm sure it 's fixable but all in all it did n't last as long as I 'd hoped .	-1
This is an affordable copy of the Boss Harmonist pedal . I bought this mainly for the harmonist and polyphonic pitch shift feature . But was surprised by how much fun the trem bar and flutter mode was to play with.Anyway on the third day the tracking on the pedal suddenly started to have about a one second delay . And on fourth day in addition to the tracking problem , hitting certain notes caused a low pitch fluttering noise . Also the pedal just started oscillating a few times . I would have given the Behringer us600 five stars if it kept working , it tracked nice and did n't tone suck too bad .	-1
I bought this pedal new , hoping to get an electric solid body guitar to sound somewhat like an acoustic guitar on stage . I knew going in that it would not sound like a Martin D-28 , but I thought it would be good enough to play a couple of acoustic parts without having to switch guitars.Imagine my profound disappointment.Really , Boss ? ? ? This is by far the worst pedal I have ever used of yours . This thing has a terrible hiss when you turn the `` Top '' control higher than about 9 o'clock . At first I thought I must have a defective unit , but then I started reading reviews on-line . Seems like it is part of the design . It 's too bad because one can hear some promise in the faux acoustic tones , hidden beneath a wall of fizz . Totally unusable , as far as I 'm concerned . By the way , I tested it direct to a PA as well as into a guitar amp with a single coil guitar ( strat ) .	-1
Good for a cheap beginner strap used for sitdown practice.This was my first guitar strap i had ever bought . I didnt really care about quality i just needed a strap to get by . Over the 6 months ive had it i took it off my electric guitar and put it on a new electric acoustic I recently got and it keeps popping off . This is a problem is standing up playing at a gig or just around your house . The guitar could take that head dive of death , while one dive might not do too much damage a few might crack the neck or worse.My Advice : unless you plan to sit and play ( which you wont really need a strap anyways ) the whole time , spend alittle more to get a leather strap . Spending more on a leather strap will help avoid hole stretching and the popping off of the strap in mid play .	-1
I used to buy a lot of wire form these guys ... . However , you need to be careful and test everything you get from them on an XLR cable tester.I did n't believe it myself ... I read another reviewer had an issue with XLR cables being wired incorrectly from pin to pin . So I took my handy cable tester and went through about a dozen cables.I got through only 4 monoprice cables before I found one that was miss-wired . Now I will be checking all of them for sure.Not a good start though.Glad the other reviewer made that discovery and passed it on.I suggest everyone check their monorpice cables . The testers are very cheap and may show problems you were n't aware of .	-1
This does work as described . It arrives without any instructions whatsoever but its fairly obvious to figure out . The reason I only gave it two stars however is because I find it so uncomfortable ! Its quite hard on your collarbone . I have added foam to it and now it works well , but I suspect one might be better just buying a foam one in the first place .	-1
Here 's the deal with this pedal . It is inexpensive and you can get a better pedal with barely a bit more money and sometimes a little less money . In my opinion , for spending less than $ 100 for a distortion pedal , whether it is your first pedal or 700th pedal , a few more bucks will get you the MXR Badass distortion which has a much crisper tone to it .	-1
Buttons itself are fine , however when I was installing it the screw broke inside the guitar ( right above the thread ) . And I even pre-drill it . there is no way I can get it out : ( so had to find real screw and drill new hole next to it ( now slightly off-center now )	-1
I am very disappointed . The guitar was packed with its strings tensioned and the top detachment partially from the guitar body.It is unusable until repaired.Update : It has been several days after writing and attach photographs to the seller ( Amazon ) , and have not received any communication .	-1
It is OK , but it does not compare to the ergo holder.Which you may find here : Dunlop Ergo Pickholder.The main problem with this pickholder is that it is very difficult to get your pick out , and it is extremely fragile .	-1
I have always loved line 6 . This product sounded great for about an hour then total gave up . It went dead . I changed channels and it worked for like a minute then went dead . I am sorry to say that I returned it . My AKG wireless guitar bug has lasted years with no drop outs.I am really disappointed .	-1
I ordered one of these because I like my other Planet Waves Capo a lot ( I believe its the older metal version of this , not the & # 34 ; Lite & # 34 ; ) . However , this one just does not screw down enough to hold down the strings , especially down at the lower frets where the neck is a little thinner ( on a Martin jumbo acoustic ) . It will barely bend the strings down behind the fret but not enough to prevent buzzing . Your fretting hand will naturally push the capo back and out of position quite easily when playing open chords too.I 'm not sure why the plastic version has this issue when it appears to have an identical design to the old metal one . It does n't seem defective as no parts are bent or missing as far as I can tell . Unless I just happen to get one with a shorter than normal screw , I would n't recommend it for any guitar without a thick neck.My recommendation is the classic Kyser capo thats more dependable and quicker to apply and remove ( it also attaches to your headstock effortlessly when not in use ) . If you are looking for the screw-down style , I would look for the older version of this and avoid the & # 34 ; Lite & # 34 ; .	-1
I got these for a custom les paul 5 string bass I had built and one of the locks broke off after a month and a couple of uses . Also the locks were quite uncomfortable to use . I had never used strap locks before and do n't think I will again .	-1
This pedal is ok at best there are a lot better metal pedals out there the only thing this one really has going for it is it has a built in noise gate other wise this pedal is pretty thin sounding and has far to much gain then you will ever need . I would personally recommend the Electro-Harmonix Metal Muff over this any day it is a better sounding pedal for about the same price .	-1
Disapointed . The sensors are not providing a clear full bright sound . It sound muffled . I will have to replace it soon .	-1
Cable crackles when plug in jack is moved . GLS brand purchased at same time works flawlessly in comparison . Both have tweed jackets however the Hosa cable does not uncoil easily where the GLS cable does . I would recommend the GLS product over the Hosa product .	-1
All I got ta say about this product is that I get a volume/tone loss when it 's plugged ; that is a very big problem for me . Other than that is very well built , but the fact that it decreases my volume is a major issue for me .	-1
Not very bright . Not very flexible . Too big . Clunky . I really do n't like it . I wish I had went in a different direction .	-1
I bought these just to add a layer of sound in my blues tunes I record , the notes do n't bend easily ... if you think your will cheat the big boys harps , youll be dissapointed quickly ... these are little more than toys compared to $ 40 dollar harps , they feel cheap but have a decent sound ... i dont know if they will last , but to make harp noises without decent bends ... Ill use these sparingly ... Jim	-1
This arrived with one end of the security strap and metal part ... Broken ! OK ... I bought it on sale and returning it would not be an option ... it would cost as much to mail back as it did to buy it ! Obviously it was not the packaging which was more than adequate and there were no broken off pieces in the box.Of course , I could not recommend this product to anyone ... most disappointing purchase !	-1
Sorry , I do n't like these as they 're just too big . They stand out too much . They do work and they 're effective but they are too pronounced . There are many good alternatives ; strap gaskets , strap locks , undoing the pin and putting it straight into the guitar strap . Again , they work , but they 're not aesthetic nor elegant . I also got a gold set for my bass and now it looks like I should be wearing big purple platforms when I play . Not cool .	-1
if you go very high with the boost in frequencies , you will get noise in significant quantities . too noisy to please me for anything except experimentation . Pay the extra money and get something quiet . Others complained about this and they were right . If you want to experiment with equalization , its good and cheap . Some complained about each band boosting others . This is more of a user problem than manufacturing . If you want to isolate a frequency range , boost that range and then cut the ones before and after it and you 'll get a narrow range . In this respect , its like an MXR 6 band .	-1
These speakers worked great for 14 months . Last week ( 4/8/13 ) , one of them would n't power up all the way . The problem is getting worse every time I try to use them , and it 's just a matter of time before it stops working . It seems there is a problem with the capacitors that I did read about in a few reviews . I took a chance on the monitors anyway , and it was a huge mistake . I only use them between 2 and 4 hours per week . I contacted M-Audio 's online support system and was given addresses to two electronics repair shops . One on the East coast and one on be west coast . I 've since found many complaints about this same issue all over the Internet and on the M-Audio support site . M-Audio does n't stand behind their products , and I 'll never purchase anything from them again .	-1
My review ( s ) for this have changed a few times , but no more . When I first got it I liked the sound , though it did sound a little cold and digital , and this is from someone wanting to record shoegaze/dreampop , which by it 's nature is full of cold tones ( reverb/chorus/delay ) shimmering , a la cocteau twins , chapterhouse , lush , so at first I thought it was great . Then the fuse software was even cooler , all this customizing the sound , though it did sound noisy and needed the compressor to take some of the noise away.After all of that I finally realized I was trying to ignore the fizz/crackle/hair , it 's called a few things . Go to the fender forums and look it up , or search it on yahoo/google.The thing happening with this amp I think is a few things . Fender guitars sound best through it , which is silly if you do n't own a fender , and I do n't and refuse to get a squire as that body is so played out , I wanted ANYTHING but a strat body , unless I have a grand to pay for an older one , I 'm not going to get a rinky dink one , and I would only get one after I got like 5 other dream guitars first.so everyone has different problems with pickup quality and guitar quality . Also , playing into a modeling amp is like playing into a computer , that may be fine for some ( younger folks ) , but to a lot of people I 've read the complaints I was trying not to realize , as I did n't feel like having to pay for shipping to return it , BUT I DID ! And I am so glad I did . I almost got a peavey vypyr , and I am glad I did n't . This amp , to be fair , is really close to being really cool , but that sound problem , which I read on fender 's own forum/website , FENDER ACKNOWLEDGES IT EXISTS , BUT DOES NOTHING TO FIX IT IN FUTURE MODELS ! ! sorry , but that 's some big company b.s.I 've been reading of people saying it sounds cold and lifeless and all that and tube this and tube that , and I was like `` what music snobs '' and what have you . But I realized that I 'm a music snob ! I love the music I listen to more than anything , and feel like the music I create should have a life to it as well . So I returned the mustang 2 and ALMOST got a marshall mg 30 watt , cause I wanted an amp with a clean sound that did n't have that crackle sound , but THANKFULLY I caught myself before that return , as after that , it would have been final.The decision I did make I think will be great for me , as I 'd rather start with a good real tone , then get the effects I need . I kept reading reviews of these teenagers that had n't played for more than a year or two or so saying `` throw away your pedals , you wo n't need them '' and `` I was going to get pedals , but do n't need to now '' , that 's kind of the danger of these amps , they end up making everyone sound the same ! No matter what tweaking I was doing on the mustang , it sounded the same but in a different costume.I think this amp and modeling amps are best for beginning guitarists and I 've seen some old timers getting an amp for home use after years , maybe that 's for them , but I needed something to record with and practice and get the best , most real tone possible , so that means tube amp.I think if I played this at a GC I would n't of gotten it , and I just tried to make myself like it .	-1
Right out of the box , the low E string had a buzz and the intonation was WAY off ( fretted E note on the 12th fret too sharp ) . After the appropriate truss rod adjustments the buzz problem was solved . Next , I proceeded to adjust the intonation . I was able to get the intonation for the A , D , G , B , and high-E strings spot on . However , after bringing the saddle for the low E string as far back as it would go , the fretted E note on the 12th fret was still sharp.I also noticed that the bridge is slightly crooked ( the low E string end of the bridge is closer to the neck than the high E string end of the bridge ) - the bridge could have started out crooked or it could have shifted due to the high low-E string tension ( loose bridge ) -- which would definitely contribute to the defective low-E string intonation.I love the Red Burst design of this guitar ( it looks absolutely WICKED ) . Unfortunately , I 'm going to have to return it . I 'm going to get a Squier Strat instead ( with either aMapleorRosewoodneck ) . -- - [ Update November 15 , 2013 ] I ordered the Squier Strat direct from Amazon 6 weeks ago , but it was placed on backorder . I contacted Customer Service a week ago and was told me they would n't get it back in stock until December . Then , to my surprise , the Squier Strat was delivered yesterday ! Yay ! ! : D The happiness ! ! I was able to get the Squier perfectly intonated . It 's Red Burst like the Legacy ( Fender calls it Antique Burst ) . It 's a beautful guitar and and I 'm loving it !	-1
The Epiphone Les Paul guitars do n't particularly sound that great , but they stay in tune much better than the cheap squier strat you can get at the same or lower price . If your kid is serious about wanting to play guitar , but you 're not completely sure if they will stick with it , if you can spend another $ 100 and get a used mexican made fender strat or tele . The reason for this is because for 1 , if they decide it 's not something they want to do anymore , you can resell it at the same price you bought it for ( as long as it is still in decent condition ) and little no money is lost . Second , if they do decide to stick with playing guitar and eventually own a & # 34 ; better & # 34 ; or more high end guitar , Mexican made teles or strats are great back up guitars for stage use . I have a couple different high end guitars and I will not get rid of my Mexy Strat because it sounds great still . I 'll never pick up my first guitar which is essentially this .	-1
D'Addario , what 's up ? These did n't last long at all.I do n't play my Martin very often , ( too busy with electrics.. ) but these were trashed in a month.Guess your using recycled car bumpers for strings now ? Never purchase again .	-1
not so pleased with this , the seller is fine , no prob . there , its that this mic for my use is useless , it records tooo low , cant get enough volume from it	-1
This is a beautiful shock mount . However for the price it didnt perform . The mount doesnt fit directly to the blue yeti and it leaks wind and plosive sounds on P 's and S 's . Not worth the price .	-1
First time using item and it broke . The round back that screws onto the mic stand broke . I was really excited to have this and us it now that I transferred all my music sheet to my iPad . As soon as I took it off the mic stand the round piece came off . Would have rather contacted the seller than post a not so good review , but it only kept referring to delivery . I do like the product and it did hold my iPad steady even with a leather case on . Sad !	-1
I purchased 4 of these , of the four 1 was no good on arrival another failed after 2 short time uses . I will not buy more . The first one was returned after some resistance from the seller the second one had passed the warranty time before it had failed . Suggest thoroughly testing these upon arrival if you purchase these . For the $ $ $ should be more dependable .	-1
Unless you guys are receiving something I am not , how can you give this anything more than one star . My backplate is so thin and cut so close to the screws that you can actually see were the route begins on the back of my Fender stratocaster . This is inexcusable . All the other Fender backplates I have have enough lip to cover the route , but not this mint green one . I simply can not understand what Fender is thinking . I am seeing nothing but product after product like this coming from Fender and it is a clear sign they are simply trying to maximize profits at any cost .	-1
If you can read the tiny little screen , this thing records nicely . But it 's a pain in the Axx to move from one selection to the other . There were a couple of times I almost threw against the wall . It has a tendency to completely freeze up and the on/off switch does nothing . You have to pull the batteries out and reinstall them for the damn thing to work again .	-1
I play harp with some some that I perform . I found that all of these Harmonica 's the note 's are off and it 's hard to play , I have G Blues harp that I compared the G harp to and the notes were a little off . The C harp was terrible . That said the only thing I like about this order is the case . I going to see if I can return them for store credit .	-1
Do NOT use these to polish your guitar . It leaves tons of small fibers all over , and is hard to clean up . A total disaster . These are good for maybe wiping up dog poop , but not cleaning anything .	-1
Strings rust very easily , yield fairly poor tone and break often , though they have the same bending ability as .09-.42 .	-1
