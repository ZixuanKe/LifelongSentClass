i heard about this particular product from a deputy sheriff he loved it . he used it every day that he was n't on the job . so , i came strait home and looked for one . i found more on other sites just like this one for way more money . he himself had paid over $ 100 for his a couple of years ago . so , i had to have it . i love it too . it 's smooth as butter , but it does take a little to & # 34 ; brake & # 34 ; in to your fit . after that , you 'll never want another inside the pant holster again .	1
As the title states , only time will tell how well this holds up but so far so good ! I have owned this for a month now . The leather softened up and started to form to my body within a day or two . The retention was great out of the packaging . The hardware seems solid and adjusted easily . When not wearing this , the Glock slides in and out easily and the retention may appear too loose , but when IWB and secured between your belt and your body , the Glock is n't going anywhere ! The retention can be adjusted as well which is a nice touch . This fit a G27 and G17 without issue . I wear this about 3 O'clock and it disappears under a T-Shirt in most cases . 4 O'clock seems more comfortable but for ME it can print more so I stick with 3 O'clock . This is a very comfortable holster and I can wear it all day without issue . The only issue I have with the holster is n't really the fault of the holster ... I 'm not thrilled with the combat cut since I have to hike up my underwear to prevent the handle from rubbing on my side ( I use grip tape ) . This is not a big deal and I knew about it going in so I ca n't knock the holster . The holster is tuckable and a undershirt can prevent issues as well . Overall , this is a fantastic value and I highly recommend this holster ! I would definitely buy another one for future gun purchases ! I will update this review with future observations .	1
This holster is already absolutely perfect ! I got one for my Glock 26 and immediately fell in love . It does need a little attention and care to get it worked in enough to where it wo n't squeak when you 're going up stairs and whatnot , but other than that , it is perfect . Keeps the handgun very secure , but still very accessible and is also very comfortable when worn correctly , almost as if it is n't there.I have already suggested many of my friends get these instead of the Crossbreed holsters , as they are generally the same thing , just half the price .	1
solid , great deal ! Well worth the money ... Fits my glock like a glove and would recommend this to anyone ... tight	1
For the price and build it is the best holster in the market . I have one for my S & W Shield and Glock 26 . Makes it easy to carry all the time .	1
I hardly no it 's there on my hip . An its e z to draw an reholster . It 's a durable , well designed holster that will last a life time .	1
I carry everywhere I go . The only addition this holster does n't have that others that cost 3 times as much do is inner liner padding . If you are a veteran CC person , you can adjust the ride height to create a VERY comfortable ride . I have carried this holster 19 days straight without issue . The molded break away is awesome . After wrestling with a friend ( with an unloaded weapon of coarse ) he was unable to remove and take possession of my weapon . I will buy again , for my other CC firearms .	1
Great holster for the price . Glock draws easily and without problem and the holster retains it no matter what . Only issue i had was with the clips . They swivel too much and can make getting it on and off a pain . Not too big of a concern but it was a minor annoyance	1
The holster looks to be well made and fits the weapon well . It holds onto the belt really well as well .	1
It was pretty stiff when I got it , , and the leather on the inside did n't feel all that comfortable . Imagine unfinished leather against your skin . It is n't bad , but I wanted a greater level of comfort . So I broke it in by bending over the leather and smashing it in a vice until the leather got really soft . Then I went to an auto store and bought some chamois for $ 10/ ( The really soft leather that people use to wash cars with ) . I used adhesive spray mount and glued it on the inside . And now it is totally perfect ! ! Love it ! This holster is a great value and I would highly recommend it if you are willing to work it in a little .	1
I love this holster . I carry a 9mm XD . It works great but if you are overweight like I am make sure your pants are loose . My pants are snug so when I then stick this inside my pants the pants become uncomfortable . I would say that is no fault of the holster .	1
comperable to galco , crossbreed ( ect ) holsters . but way better price . leather is stiff at first but give it time and it will wear in . then its comfy . imprint is small to none . i wear my xd 40 subcompact with confidence . no fear of a flash at all . good quality and finish .	1
The holster came fast and so far the holster is perfect . Great cheaper version of the galco holsters . fits snug and retention was great . I have the XD9 Subcompact and it fits to my body very well . I wear it in the 4 o clock position . Im 6 foot and 145 pounds and the firearm doesnt print at all . I highly suggest this holster for anyone who doesnt want to spend the 70 bucks on a galco . This holster is great .	1
husband likes this .	1
Leather could be a little more finished , but as good as ones that take 2 months to get and cost more . I now have another one and will be getting a third .	1
She loves this for he personal protection . works just as well as a crossbread . ( still not as good as crossbreed but still a very nice holster ) you can adjust the angle very easy and is a great holster especially for the price .	1
I have had more expensive holsters like the cross breed and for the money this holster is the way to go . I would buy another one .	1
It should first be noted , before you read the rest of my review , that I do not carry every day , only occasionally , so my experiences may be different from those who do carry day-in , day-out.For $ 20-50 cheaper than other similar holsters made by bigger name brands , I find it hard to beat the value of this holster . Build quality is good , gun fitment in the kydex part is positive and secure , and the leather is breaking in pretty nicely . At first , of course , it was a bit tough , but after wearing it for just a couple of hours it started to feel a bit softer as it flexed . Whenever I wear this holster ( this is my first holster , and first time concealed carrying any gun ) , usually within a few minutes of walking around I forget it 's there . Purely by nature of this style of holster , the weight is distributed nicely on the wide set hooks , which works wonders for day-long comfort.My only `` issue '' ( if you can even call it that ) was that the edges of the kydex were a bit sharp ( not enough to cut your hand or quickly rip through fabric , just not smooth ) , so I took 2 minutes and rounded the edges with some 200-grit sandpaper just to make it all smoother.I would definitely recommend this holster ( and already have to a couple of friends of mine ) .EDIT 7/8/13 : After having worn this holster a good number of times over the past few months since I bought it I am liking it more and more , especially after adjusting the holster to get a bit more cant . My M & P ; stays put when running up and down stairs , going on hour-long walks with the dog , and anything else I 've done with it . The only thing I 'm noticing is the screws that hold the belt clips on occasionally have to be tightened a bit , but that can always be solved with a dab or two of thread lock . Overall I 'm really liking it . It 's easy to put on and has held its shape well so far . I 'll likely update this again later in the year .	1
OUTSTANDING holster . I have owned several other holsters with this same design feature for some of my pistols . I have always thought this style of holster was very comfortable and concealed better than other types . The biggest limit to these style of holsters is the costs ... then comes FOXX HOLSTERS . I was a little skeptical when I ordered the holster because the price was so low , however I have been very happy with it so far . VERY VERY comfortable fit , pistol seems to fit slightly tighter in the holster than other brands I own ( such as kingtut and white hat ) which I like . The cant forward on it is located at the correct angle , clips are good quality , and fit / finish is just as good as anyone else . The only thing that it does n't have is adjustable screws that connect the kydex and leather . I knew this before purchasing the holster and am ok with it after using it . Some of these type of holsters take slight adjustment with those screws in order to set the retention properly for your pistol . Mine did not need adjusting , which was nice . I fully recommend this holster for anyone who carries daily . Great bang for your buck : ) Hope this helped .	1
Very happy with it . Had purchased a competitors model on line and after 5 weeks ( company estimated 6-8 week delivery ) the order was not even started . Cancelled the order and ordered this one . Was half the price with shipping and was delivered in less than 2 weeks ( less than half of original ship time ) . Never had one from the competitor but can imagine what justifies it costing twice as much . If your on the fence about buying such a big rig do n't be . Little learning curve on getting the positioning and cant correct but after that its extremely comfortable and the gun disappears visually as well as physically feeling it .	1
I have been carriying my M & P 40C in this holster for about 3 days or so . at first i thought the leather was going to take a long time to break in . this was not the case was broken in by the end of the first day . this thing is amazing so comfy could carry it all day with no problums . retention is good when fully loaded you can flip upside down and it wont fall out and it is easy to draw . the only problums i see with this holster is that the clips are very week and flimsy have drew from it multiple time and it has not come uncliped from my waist but we will see how it works with time . so far so good ! ! !	1
I own a 40C & a 45C and it fit 's both perfectly . I own several brands of kydex & leather inside the waistband holsters and this is one of the very best ones . Secure hold , good adjustibility & really comfortable .	1
I purchased this holster for a Kahr Cm9 ... .Real nice holster ... Quality materials used , grest craftsmanship and great price ... I returned it though because Im just dont carry behind the back well ... I contacted Foxx Holsters with in the 14 day trial period and exchanged it for a Foxx Trapp IWB holster ... .I love the holster ! ... .Carrys great for me , draws and reholsters smooth and easy ! ... I 'm buying more for other carry pistols ... checkout their website ! ... ... Thanks Foxx Holsters ! ! ! !	1
I am very pleased with this holster for my Kahr CM9 . The kydex holster part tightly holds the pistol in place while walking , sitting or jogging . The leather is of great quality . I do suggest to rub mink oil creme to soften it up quicker . The adjustable hooks are a huge plus . Much cheaper than buying a Crossbreed holster and its the same quality . Will purchase for my future EDC weapons .	1
I have struggled with being able to comfortably carry my Kahr cw 9 . I 've had this holster for about 3 weeks and absolutely love it . It is adjustable and keeps my gun very secure even with out a belt on.I like this so much I ordered another holster for my Glock 26.Like the headline says & # 34 ; Quit Looking and Order It & # 34 ;	1
After adjusting the tilt , using locktite on the screws and heating the form fit plastic and letting in cool properly , it works great , comfortable and for the price , I 'd buy another if needed . The one I bought for my glock needed bother , was perfect right out of the box	1
Having read the existing reviews , I felt confident about taking a chance on this product . I was n't disappointed.FoxX holsters appear to be well thought out and constructed of quality materials . As an IWB holster , it 's not going to be seen by anyone , so the next comment is strictly subjective and my opinion only . I would much preferred the rivets black chrome instead of silver chrome plated.That aside , there 's little to fault here . Materials are top notch and so is the quality of workmanship . I used to make all leather holsters myself until I found that customers expected to pay the same amount of money they would pay for cookie cutter stamped out rigs . I know quality when I see it and while I can see some room for improvement I do n't see it at the price FoxX is charging . This opinion admittedly is based one only one holster ( the one I bought ) but judging from other reviews , I 'd say I 'm not alone in my opinion.This is a darned fine product for the money and to be honest , is worth every penny and then some . I would n't hesitate to recommend this company to other people ... ... friends and family included .	1
Had this for about 4 months now . Works great does its job . My kahr cw9 fits snug . Need one for my xd 40 next . I do recommend this . Great price and fast shipping .	1
This suit looks great . I used it for a Halloween costume , and now I have one for my prepper gear . Everyone needs one of these .	1
is quite easy to use , comes the pants , shirt with buttons , the head covering is a kind of thinner fabric to see through it and also comes with a smaller piece to camouflage the m4a1	1
I have been wanting to buy ghillie suit for a while now . I had a suit that had some leaf like attachments and it worked fine and was really light and easy to carry . Unfortunately on one of my hunting trip it must have fallen out or got left behind so I found myself without any 3d camouflage for spring turkey . I was really thinking that the more expensive one was the way to go and had to be better given that it also is almost twice as heavy as this one . But the penny pincher in me decided that the added effectiveness it might afford was not really justified by how much more it cost . Also I had just purchased a lot of things for the house so my budget was pretty stretched . I read the negative reviews and thought Oh well perhaps they are things I will find to be negative but decided to give this suit a try.When it arrived it was stuffed in its carry bag inside out which I thought was a good idea to protect the strands of material . It only took a few moments to get everything out . It was more full than I thought it might be and it actually had 4 pieces so you get the gun cover too although I have no idea how you are supposed to attach it to a gun that allows you to operate your gun if you had too . I have yet to fluff it up yet but even without doing a thing there were no significant areas where the backing material was all that you saw . The head piece allows you too see well but mouth calls might be an issue as their is no simple way of getting to your mouth . I Thought it would be more like a boonie had with cammo hanging down but it really does not compare to a hat in any way . It will perform its function but the material that is used to go on your head looks to be scrap materials that they use up in making it . Not really the prettiest thing you will see but it works just fine.The snaps are kind of cheap plastic ones that I can see might be an issue . The few times I used the suit they have worked so maybe my concerns are unwarranted . No matter if they did break a few pieces of velcro and some clothing glue would fix the problem pretty quickly and easily.I can see that this lighter one is still going to be a little warm in hot weather so I still might go out an buy a leafy suit for hunting in the summer months . The also are much smaller and easier to carry . Oh I think some posts talked about material falling out . I did not see any and none came out as I tried to detangle the threads on the front part of the suit . I also did not notice that any fell out after using it for hunting.Ultimately , I can not say that this is as good the more expensive suites . I would have to see them side by side . But I think this suit is excellent at this price . I usually carry my camo in and put it on very near where I plan to hunt so I can not say if this would work if you are someone who likes to stalk hunt . It did pick up quite a few leaves and twigs from the area I where I hunted so moving through bushes and trees certainly would get you tangled at some point . I am 5'10 inches and 230 # and the suit fit over a light jacket . Not sure it would work over a winter coat for me but it is big enough to fit most people I would think .	1
During testing of this ghillie suit , I was successfully able to hide from people actively searching for me from distances as close as 15 yards , and I 've managed to lure in coyotes so close you could almost reach out and touch them.One severe drawback is that these very , very easily get entangled with twigs and debris , and cleaning the junk out of them is a chore and a half .	1
haha , this ghillie suit is great ... a lot of fun.. ( used it for Halloween , scared some people ) looks good ( once fluffed of course ) covers head to toe , light , and if you where gon na be using this for airsoft/paintpall/war ? you can easily roll in your woodland area to pick up natural debris and really C.Y.A . ( cover your ass of course ) fits into a camo mesh bag ( supplied ) the size of a small ( er ) pillow.if there is no breeze , and its 60+ degrees , you are going to be HOT ! ! ! ( a slight breeze cuts right through the cheaper quality 'mesh ' and the strands ( sewn on ) over all ? cheap ( er ) and affective would buy again . ( just for the laughs/scares i got out of this product alone where worth the money to me )	1
My son wanted to be a sniper for Halloween , and after looking at some other options we decided on this ghillie suit . He 's small for a 10 year old ( now 11 ) so I was a bit worried this would be too big for him . Upon arrival my son tore open the box and started to put it on - it looked great ! It fit him just fine , and he has room to grow into it.We decided to go outside and see how well it would blend in with the fall colors of New England . I gave my son 5 minutes to hide , and I would then seek him out . After discovering he could n't just lie in the yard and magically vanish , he got the hang of hiding close to trees , bushes , and other natural plant life and was able to elude my detection on several occasions.Since Halloween , he has continued to wear the ghillie suit when he plays army with his friends . They all love it . With a bit of face paint and some gloves he really can disappear into the woods . The description does n't list this , but I believe it also came with a thin section of cloth meant to wrap around a rifle . I took this for myself.My only complaint is that the threads sometimes come off in small clumps after use . I find the threads all over the house . I have n't seen a bare spot form because of this , so it 's a minor complaint .	1
It fit me like a glove . I wish there was more layers of yarn though , a couple of spots where the yarn doesnt cover as well . after a couple uses it started too lose some yarn but its ok i just added some leaves from the ground	1
Ordered this for my son last Halloween , OK it is a bit much but that is what he wanted and believe me he has warn it several times airsoft hunting as well and it is holding up very good for a 11 year old ( kids are not easy on things ) . The unit looks great and fit good on him , it is long enough it would fit me as well , good buy .	1
Have n't used it yet , thank fully . but the sound is terrifying enough . I do feel safer with it even if the fallacy involves close contact .	1
I will be ordering more of these.I have n't had the chance to actually use one , but the sound of the electricity is a little menacing.Kind of thick for an actual I-Phone but a cool device never-the-less .	1
My girl friend loves it , although she is scared of it at the same time .	1
The device arrived expediently , it appears to be of good quality and except for the thickness really does look like an iPhone . It comes with a nice leather case that you can put on your belt if you need to that I did not expect.My only criticism is that the instructions are in a tiny , micro booklet that I actually had to get a magnifying glass to read . Other than that it appears to be a good product although I hope never to actually have to test it in the truest sense .	1
I have n't had the oppurtunity to use this holster . But I love the functionality . It is fully adjustable and can be change for right or left or double carry .	1
This is a really nice fitting shoulder holster at a really great price . Shipping was prompt as well . I would recomment this item to others .	1
Do n't get me wrong . This is a superb piece of work . It has great weight , and is made of durable ABS plastic that has protected my head from powerful airsoft weaponry . On the down side , it is a little large for your average head . This really is n't a major problem , as the helmet is highly adjustable . The main problem is the buckle . It is relatively fragile , and one of the outer teeth broke off the second time I accidentally dropped the helmet . The helmet still buckles , but it became even more fragile and is very liable to unbuckle at the average jerk of the head . Besides this problem , the helmet fits very securely onto your head after adjustment and is a great helmet .	1
Fit 's nicely and is adjustable . Has a chin strap for a better fit . I recommended for airsoft and paintball players	1
i ordered this to use as a prop in my movies and videos 1:1 scale replica the package came on time in perfect condition no complaints as for as how the it operates in the field i dont do airsoft battles ! i will do business with this company again in the future ! thank you -- -- - > DramaVisionS & lt ; -- -- --	1
got these for myself and my husband to use during air soft matches . they fit nice and do their job as described . would pruchase again .	1
It is a good product . A little large , could use more padding , and the chin strap was too long for my 12 yr old sun . He uses it for affect playing airsoft . He enjoys it , but since he can not strap it on tight it tends to shift during play .	1
This helmet does not only look cool but it functions just like the real thing , I 've been taking it into battle a lot an it has always served it purpose .	1
The Packaging was n't exactly fantastic but it arrived undamaged none the less . It looks just like the real thing ( real thing as in the one made of kevlar and not a durable plastic ) and it fits on comfortably . The only thing wrong is the chin strap , i just do n't understand it . Perfect for airsoft or paintball .	1
I bought this for my air-soft military get up . its great and it fits my head perfectly the only complaint that i have is that when ever you move around you have to hold it up because it will slip back and forth .	1
Fits 11 y/o son good . Provides protection for airsoft . Would recommend and buy again . Does what it 's supposed to . Buy	1
It does what it was meant to do.Protect your head from bb 's and Trees or whatever place you are playing in.I use it for airsoft and it is pretty good.Cheap too !	1
My daughter has grabbed mine for the last time . She now has her own when she goes paintballing , and she loves it . Just put her name on it and away she went . She wants to become a SWAT Officer like the ole man . God save us all . G.Goff	1
I was worried this was going to be & # 34 ; toy & # 34 ; quality for the price.I was happily surprised at the quality of the manufacturing . The fit of the webbing , and the overall appearance.Better than expected in all aspects !	1
Not really a kevlar brain bucket . But with the right cover no one knows the difference . Planed on using this as part of memorial to a fallen friend/hero .	1
I bought this helmet to play airsoft in . It works well and looks pretty legit . up close however , you can see that the bottom rim was glued on messily and the chin strap came undone and has been a pain in my ass since . overall i 'd say this helmet is not the most well assembled helmet but it does do its job so it 's all good . 4/5 for being of somewhat low quality , but since it was n't expensive I ca n't complain really .	1
Getting hit on the head with a paintball is no fun and this lightweight helm will protect you from paintball head aches .	1
works . the leg straps are a little small if your 6 foot tall and 250 lbs . holds xd-40 with light well .	1
I ordered this to hold my Colt 1911 , first generation . Fits nicely with adjustment but I do n't think it would fit anything smaller . Everything except the leg straps and hammer strap are hook and loop fastener , everything is decent quality and fairly heavy fabric . I only go shooting once a month or so , so I 'm betting I 'm going to get a very long life out of this holster . The upper strap is a little on the short side and I 'm not a & # 34 ; larger & # 34 ; person . Overall , money well spent for the price !	1
I like it . Not perfect , but very versatile . My only complaint , is it seems a little wide for most pistols . I suppose that makes sense though , as lights/lasers may be wider than your slide .	1
I have big thighs and wont go buckle on top leg strap	1
For the price this holster is crazy awesome . It is made of thick nylon material , totally adjustable , spare mag pouch . Top notch .	1
Great product with a great price . fast and free shipping , it 's a super duty knife and fits in my hands really well . it 's sooo sharp that you need to be careful , it 's like a razor . I 'm absolutely satisfied with this product and seller .	1
I bought this knife at first because of the way it looks and the price . Once I received it I was very happy with quality compared to the price . For 10 bucks you cant really go wrong ,	1
I 've been adding to my tactical/survival knife collections recently due to all of the great high value buys available through Amazon . I selected this product based on an over all evaluation and the fact I prefer a multifaceted tool like this at about 10.5 inches maximum length . I actually do carry many of the knives I own finding them very useful . This HK-1036S fit the bill in all respects , meeting the description to a T , very comfortable to hold , solid , good weight distribution , full tang with a very comfortably cushioned hard rubber handle.Of course , like all online knife orders , it had to be sharpened to my standards upon arrival . This knife takes a good edge with very little effort if using the correct tools . The nylon sheath is rather substantial and almost 'heavy duty ' in nature , yet at this price a very good value . I am very happy with this purchase and the performance of the seller through Amazon . I highly recommend this company and the product for multiple uses short of hacking your way through a jungle .	1
I am not a & # 34 ; knife person & # 34 ; as many others on Amazon seem to be . I can say that this knife appears to be solid and sturdy . It 's sharp , no doubt . I have it with emergency supplies in my car . If I 'm lucky , I 'll never need it , but I 'm glad to know I have it , just in case .	1
This knife is very light , the handle feels like it will break easy . Not a bad investment for 10.00 bucks . It will work for what I want . I was just hoping it would be better than in the picture . I 'm still glad I purchased it.I need to retract what I said above . I took my knife out to test it and it really handled extremely well . The blade was very sharp right out of the box . It actually cut through rope like a knife through butter . This is a great starter knife for a young adult learning to use a knife . I would reccomend this knife as I have shown it to my friends and the are going to purchase it .	1
For the price this is a decent knife . At first I was surprised by how light it was ... I have some much heavier duty knives such as the Becker BK2.However this one does have a comfortable handle , do n't know what it is made of , some sort of hard rubber or rubber coating . Not sure if it is & # 34 ; full tang & # 34 ; or not but I have thrown it against a tree a coiuple dozen times to see if it would loosen up and it has n't . I like the design , not sure about the durability.It came surprisingly sharp.The sheath is probably the weak link with this , they should have at least put a plastic insert in there but again for about $ 8.50 including shipping it 's a bargain .	1
Received my knife today . I 'll have to sharpen it . Most of these knifes are n't sharp . The knife feels pretty good too , in my hand . After a few slaps across my sharpening stone , I may have a sharp knife then . Today , I 'd recommend this knife to everyone ! If this changes , I 'll be back to change my review .	1
I took it to Big Bend NP , small enough to fit on my belt . My son wore it the last day on the trip . Now , it 's his !	1
greta little knife for the price.If you like knives like me this is a great one.its pretty durable i ` ve have taken on fishing trips and camping it ` s awesome for the price	1
This is n't a $ 100 knife so did n't expect it to be . For $ 10.53 freight paid you ca n't go wrong . But if you require a top notch knife and have the extra cash to spend this will not be for you .	1
This knife was a very nice knife for the price ! It has a nice feel to it and it can hold 's a nice and sharp edge ! !	1
It 's like they fit the knife for my hand . It fit perfectly and my fingers automatically when in the grooves . I have n't field tested it but it came very , very , very sharp . I like the look of the blade and the top part of the sheath is hollow and you can easily slide your belt through it . I recommend getting it .	1
While these did take a little while to arrive ( 3-4 weeks perhaps ? ) their low cost makes them worthwhile . They are wider and softer than other headbands I 've purchased at sporting goods stores and do a fine job of soaking up sweat .	1
Very effective . I use these biking . They are thin enough to fit under the helmet without effort , but absorbent enough to stop the sweat in the eyes problem that a hot day will produce . They seem strong enough to permit many reuses and washings and the price is perfect . Recommended !	1
I ordered these before I read the reviews and I was concerned . First of all , yes , they do n't fit out of the box , but it 's not because they are not the right size . The area the needs to be ground down slightly is just the last 1/4 inch on each side of the clip . These are stampings that are then bent , so it does not take much brains to figure out that the very ends bow out just slightly due to the stamped piece being bent . Take a dremel with a sanding or grinding tool and even the edges out near each end of the clip ( only takes a few seconds ) and they will fit with no problems . They strip fine into the gun , but may stick a little at first because they are not used . Give them a good cleaning , then coat in gun oil and wipe off excess and they will load , no problem.The people who are complaining that they flat out do n't fit and are horrible are just too lazy to do a few minutes of work on an item that will probably outlive the gun you are shooting . The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because I had to do some light dremel work ... not a real big deal . Expect to spend 10 to 20 minutes to grind , clean and coat the entire set in oil , and the product will work fine .	1
This rack worked great on the top shelf of my safe , but was too wide for the second shelf . I had to cut the magazine orgaziners off of the ends for it to fit on the lower shelves.The the coating is good , does n't leave any marks on the pistols and does n't scratch anything . The spaces are a little wide so all of my pistols lean in the spaces which can then be a little tricky removing a pistol in the middle without touching either pistol sitting adjacent . If you are real particular about dinging your pistols together , just be careful . The grips on the bottom of the rack prevents the whole rack from sliding around which is good.The Mag organizer is good for 1911 mags , but useless for double stack mags in my opinion.Overall , it is what I wanted so I am okay with that .	1
I like these and use them to hold a few guns while out on the range competing . They 'll also hold 2 magazines on each end and just make things more organized . Their lite weight and easy to carry around when its time to move stuff or pack up.They also work well to organize things in the safe.Their a good quality product . Buy em and you 'll be happy with them .	1
The scope is very nice - no distortion and the sight lines are perfectly perpendicular which I 've found to be a problem in other scopes . The laser , though , is the bomb . Why even use the scope ? True story : I snapped this on the Picatinny rail on my modified Ruger 10-22 , took it outside , turned on the laser , put that little green dot on a knothole in a tree 30 yards away , and pulled the trigger . Dead center without even zeroing the thing in . Fluke ? Nope -- tried it again from about the same distance and a different target -- dead center . Where that laser pointed is where the bullet went .	1
I use this on my small game gun ( Savage 64 ) . Out of all the scopes I have , this scope was one of the easiest to mount and Zero .	1
def worth the price . the laser is very high powered . can see it for wuite a distance . Id get another one	1
Everything works great . Laser is viewable in bright day light up to 20-30 yards . Really bright . The Scope works well.The only thing I can say negatively about this is the lens optics can be better . I can tell the view is not AS sharp and clear as my Bushnell scope . It 's not that you ca n't see clearly what you are aiming at . It 's very usable . But side by side with my other scope , you can tell the difference with the quality of the lenses . But for this price , I 'd buy it again .	1
The magnifier works great on my S & W ; M & P15 ; , however I too stripped out one of the mounting screws and the rail mount comes loose after just a few shots . Good eye relief . I was able to position in front of my magpol rear flip sight and my ACOG style scope.I will be looking into a flip to side mount to replace the stock one .	1
I mounted this on my Steyr AUG with my Aimpoint Patrol Rifle Optic ( red dot ) on a flip-to-side mount and its a great addition to my rifle . The optics are not amazing though - it will not replace a real scope . There are some parallax problems that require you to adjust your eye relief when changing magnifications , and the light collection is fairly bad . That being said , I can hit soda cans at 100 yards with a red dot sight , so for the price I am very happy with this !	1
Setup with a NCStar red dot ( setup w/cowitness ) . With the magnifier flipped down , the cowitness is gone and actually darkens the overall sight picture . IIRC , I was able to adjust the red dot to center of magnifier via magnifier ... which is great ! The parallax on this is terrible and the eye relief miserable ... the Eotech magnifiers I have used are better for both , but not hundreds of dollars better , IMHO . If you are buying EOTech , you are buying for a number of reasons ... most of which there is n't a dollar figure you can attribute . For hobby shooting , this does the job ... but you 'll need some patience .	1
I have a great ankle holster with positive retention and fleece padding , but with my large calf and weapon weight , the holster would become 'unconcealed ' without this device .	1
I 've had a time cutting the velcro excess material but otherwise it 's very helpful . I wore the holster for a few days without this strap and then with it to compare . No doubt I like it better with this strap . Less rocking , gets it off my foot . I just wish there was even more velcro all the way around somehow .	1
Bought this to go with the Desantis ankle holster . The picture of the ankle holster shows this strap in use , but it did not actually come with it . The holster was simply falling into my shoe ( I have large tapering calf muscles ) . I bought this strap and have worn the ankle holster easily since . The strap gets wrapped around the top of the calf so that it is hard for it to fall . Holds everything in place fine . FYI there is a preferred wrap direction to prevent skin irritation by the plastic buckles , etc .	1
i 've had a few sets and these are by far my favorite , loved em so much i got a an extra set.easy to throw , stick well , look cool	1
I was also very surprised with the quality of these knives and percision they had for the price . I was a bit sceptical but I think they work great and might buy another set so I do n't have to retrieve them so often when I use them .	1
Theses are great , very easy to throw . They are very sharp and pointy . I really like this set , it another must have . I will purchase more in the future .	1
I bought this knife because I love the rainbow alloy . It is heavier than I expected , which is a good thing . I love the color and the blade was quite sharp , but I have since sharpened it . I love to use it , but do n't be offended if your friends and family wo n't because they think it 's too pretty .	1
I have no regrets about this purchase , The picture shows exactly what it is and it looks great . Awesome knife . Modern	1
.I was a tad skeptical of tac force knives as they are so cheap [ 8.00 for this one ] but i had bought a similar one , the police rescue version and was highly impressed at its durability and ease of sharpening , . This is no exception , crazy razor sharp out of the box a little slow on the deploy true but more i use it , faster it gets . the blade is beautiful a blue , green red look depending on how you turn it , blade is 440 stainless steel handles are aluminum , window breaker is nice as its made a part of the liner system much stronger than my other Tac Force which is held in by screws holds in aluminum handle as seen in picture allow you to even see the spring mechanism , all and all a good daily use knife , for work , and outdoors , and if you loose or break it . no biggie i did say it was about $ 8.00 good buy for the money	1
Came on time and well packaged . the shine was great , and the sharpness was beautiful . there was one little nick in the blade where the oxide did n't go through , but that did n't really matter to me . however , i usually take my knifes apart to remove the spring because it is technically not legal to carry a spring loaded weapon in my area , but the screws that are used for this knife and basically all tac-force knives are of terrible quality . that 's my only complaint .	1
What a beautiful knife ! easy to open . Make wonderful sound when you open it . cheap in price but not quality . If you like to play with the knife like I do , this is the one to own .	1
A small and mobile knife that fits perfectly in your pocket or bag . The knife is very sharp . 5 stars for me .	1
Nice looking , well made sturdy , sharp as a razor and looks like it will do the job . I had several , single-purpose knives in my vehicle ; now just this one and the dinky thing with the scissors , nail file , etc . The opening & # 34 ; assist & # 34 ; is very close to switchblade mode .	1
i purchase this knife and has great weight works good and is really sharp .. this knife for my needs is perfect if you bought this and says that is not to good well your probably stuck in a forest you need a chain saw or a machete .	1
The knife is very solid , sexy , and sharp ! You should buy a sharpener though , since it 'll wear down in the future . I already bought one since they were like $ 2 off on Amazon recently , so I grabbed the deal right away.The knife is smooth , you can feel the assisted opening very well.You should also oil the parts where the knife comes out . Use a paper towel and oil it with some oil for guns and other stuff , and smear it around the mechanism where the blade switches out . It 'll make it smoother.Thanks for a great item that is affordable !	1
Riding in an undisclosed country in South America every weekend I needed protection for a 'just in case ' situation . The spring assisted opening needs some practice . What I can vouch for is the little glass breaker tip . Worked perfect on a door window and a mirror . This happened in a ultimate personal defense situation where I had to react quickly while urban bike riding . Will buy again .	1
I purchased the knife as a gift for my son who is an EMT . The window point and the belt cutter are two fantastic additions to an already great knife . The assist open works great and does not open unless needed .	1
I purchased this knife for my wife . She is an EMT , and I thought that this would be an excellent addition to the arsenal of equipment that she carries . The blade is sharp , and has seemed to hold up well . The serrations are nice to have for cutting , and the spring assistance is great for one hand opening . The locking mechanism keeps the blade open without any problem , and it is easily disengaged to close the knife . As for the seat belt cutter and glass punch , she has not used those as of yet . They appear as if they should work . Would definitely buy without any reservations . The price is great , and so is the quality .	1
It 's a nice , solid , good looking knife . It opens with a nice loud clink . But very hard to open with the useless thumb tab . But easy to open with the index finger switch . looks like a expansive knife .	1
I ordered two as gifts , they were nice looking and unique . Well , when I opened the first box , I decided I was going to have to order more . The first one is mine.These knives are well built , with good heft . The action is smooth , the blade is stainless Steel , takes an edge very well , and so far it is keeping it . A drop of oil on both sides of the hinge , and it snaps open with ease . The liner lock is consistent with its locking the blade , I have placed the blade against a desk and tried to push it closed overpowering the lock . It did n't budge ! I have already bought 4 more . as friends have seen mine , and want their own .	1
These are nice little knives . The plastic case holds it firmly in place . The knife is sharp enough . The & # 34 ; paracord & # 34 ; is junk but you can easily remove it . I just remove the cord and leave the knife bare .	1
Holds a good edge . Handy holster , stays put untill you need it . Grip needs to be wrapped with heavier cord .	1
This is a must for every backpacker as a backup knife and for a prepper if you are one . Small , sharp and very utilitarian .	1
Nothing fancy , but was n't looking for fancy . I was looking for protection . I put this around my neck and my husband was in the bathroom and I said see what happens if I get attacked , I spray them with pepper spray first and if they keep coming at me I , Then I put my hand under my tshirt and pulled out my knife and said then they get this ! ! ! Any questions ?	1
Ok so this is an inexpensive stainless steel knife . Nice deep blade . Should be an acceptable skinner . Nice sheath too .	1
this is great quality for the price . i bought one mtech knife , and LOVED it for the price so i bought these 3 more . with free shipping , all 3 knives were $ 38 total . this was the priciest at $ 18 but one of my best purchases made this year for sure , going to be hard to beat.it seems hard sheathed but its secureX so you just have to remove it in a fluid , straight motion.its VERY solid and the blade thick as hell . youd have to really do something insane to break this thing.i like wearing the sheath around my neck or over shoulder . very convenient for regular or cross draw.very sharp as well .	1
LOVE ME SOME MTECH KNIVES , LOTS OF KNIFE FOR MEDIUM MONEY , HAS MTECH QUALITY ! ! !	1
First it arrived early , very happy about that . Second it is a beautiful knife . Although , as people have said , the string comes off pretty easily . So far they are wonderful training knives for a novice such as my self . I do recommend these for first time users .	1
Knife really sticks well , little heavy not the average weight of a throwing knife . I like the finger hole of the knife handle grips well and easy to rotate and do tricks with . Just use caution when playing with this knife very sharp not a toy . The knife carrier is also awsome as well , holds all 3 knifes perfect in its place for safety when you carry . I am a professional knife thrower and you can get at least 50 feet out of this knife and still be able to stick something . Have fun but most of all be safe	1
I am not a competition knife thrower.. That said these knives are pretty cool to mess around with ! ! I have destroyed my dart board with them ! ! Oh well ... Fun little knives ! !	1
These should not be thrown like an ordinary throwing knife . You do n't want these things flipping through the air . You actually want to minimize the amount of rotation with these because they 're designed to be thrown more like shuriken.Due to the weight I would compare these to a form of Teppan shuriken . These were mid weight projectiles designed for more moderate distances , however they are effective close up as well . Each one weighs approximately 40 grams.The sheath is very heavy duty , the tips of the throwers are very sharp , ( some of the sharpest ) strong , and they do not stick through to the other side of the sheath , at least not for a wile and as long as you do n't shove them in there.This is a good set for the advanced knife thrower looking to learn something new , or anyone into shuriken-jutsu looking for something more advanced to practice with.Also , the knife and sheath design I absolutely love . It 's great to carry on your belt.I say pick these up , they 're well made , and look mean . Plus other knives at this price do n't compare . These are probably the sharpest throwers ( and I mean the tip of course ) that I have ever bought.After more throwing , I will add any more info to this review that I feel could be helpful to buyers out there.Other reviews on similar throwers of high quality on my profile page may be helpful to anyone looking for more options .	1
So fun for beginnners !	1
I love these throwing knives they hit hard into wood and stays in very deep . My arms didnt get tired from throwing them , my arms got tired from pulling them out . lol I have never put this much force into any throwing knives and because of its size , its usually a 80 % chance it will be point in . The tip are durable , they stayed sharp after hitting the ground multiple times . I just love them . I even bought a second triplet so I can have 6 : D buy these ! ! ! ! ! !	1
very sharp and accurate within around 20 feet . it has a hand grip so i can hold it comfortabley . good overal	1
Very sharp and light . Made for long distance throwing . The tip is vulnerable , especially if the target is missed . Only use if you have some experience throwing knives . Highly recommended otherwise .	1
Have never thrown knives before . Was sticking on first throws into plywood . They penetrate deep so you have to really wiggle them out of the wood . You have to throw straight on and they fly like an arrow . Ordered more and great price to start learning how to throw a knife . Of course larger ones I am sure would be thrown differently and do more damage , these work great for practice . and small enough to carry on belt for quick defense .	1
I throw these with my brother every once in a while . We like them . Obviously the tips bend when you hit concrete but the straighten easily.The nylon string on the handles comes off easily but you can CAREFULLY melt the ends and press them to the handle to secure them for good . WEAR GLOVES	1
Just what I wanted , The knifes are Unsharpened , but very pointy and perfectly balanced , Great purchase for knife enthusiasts . And the Finger is alot more fun then I realized .	1
Be aware these are not TOP quality knives , but they could be . I am a new be knife thrower and so fare these have exceeded my expectations . They are well balanced , it is sleek and black , and comes very sharp , and forms well in the hand ! The only problem so far is because they are dark and sharp I loose them in the grass and dirt ... . a lot . HIGHLY recommend .	1
Very nice I really like these they are awesome lighter then what I am used to but still amazing.they are sharp but not extremely sharp they throw really wellI 'm kind of new to this knife throwing thing so I think they are great	1
They ( we ) like them , they do chip off paint some after bouncing of the ground some , mainly the corner edges . We are just learning to throw , so bouncing off target not uncommon , lol They are a little light but have nice feel/balance and stick with probably below average talent at this point .	1
Spent all day throwing these after christmas ! Only issue is losing them when you miss the target ... .may orange handles would help .	1
Like other reviewers , I can say these are excellent for learning with . They come shipped in the sheath : a three-tiered slot system . Unfortunately , they 're shipped with all three blades in one tier , which distends that part of the sheath . So , you 'll have one tier-slot that is looser than the other two . Once you get to practicing for speed-of-draw , you 'll really need to figure out what mounting system you 're going to use regularly/permanently and get a sheath-system ( made or bought ) that you 're going to be using/wearing throughout the future.Balance , in my opinion , is about right for throwing ; with weight a little heavier towards the point . Everyone has a preference , you need to figure out what your 's is . Unless you 're very talented - or a savant - with throwing knives ( a talent many only *think* they have ) , then practice , practice , practice , is the only thing that 's is going to let you improve . When you get skilled enough to hit your target point-first 80 % of the time , *then* go for the set of knives that are going to be more expensive , and which will be the ones you carry with you throughout your future . Until then , these are good for that & # 34 ; practice , practice , practice & # 34 ; part.For most of us , realists anyway , these are just fine . Throwing knives are NOT going to be a main weapon for anyone but those savants I spoke of earlier . Throwing knives are best used as : ( 1 ) a threat an opponent must respect ( if you practice/are good enough not to make them laugh when you throw it ) , ( 2 ) a distraction that can buy you the necessary second - or two - you need to save yourself through ... whatever : grabbing a better weapon , escaping , dodging , hiding , etc , ( 3 ) a device which , if it damages an opponent , can help to wear them down.Throwing knives are *not* great as tools like a pocket-blade is : they 're too fragile/light to handle any sort of pressure . They are not great as a second-hand weapon for defense : too fragile/light , again . They are not supposed to be a main weapon , unless you *really* are a savant in using them : and even then , I would n't recommend it . But , throwing weapons ( knives , stars , darts , et al ) *are* useful in many ways , you just need to be smart about them .	1
I 'm a beginner knife thrower and wanted a set to practice with.I liked these ones since they were decently long and had a more solid handle ( they did n't have a ring type thing at the end of their handle ) .The knives came pretty pointy , which was nice ; and the edges were quiet dull , which is great for people who like to throw half spins , and nice for people that like to throw full spins as well ( they do n't have to worry as much about cutting their hands ) .After about two hours of practicing with a cardboard target the end of one got a little bit dull but the others stayed sharp ( the downfall of cheap knives , they dull fast ) The only other gripe I have is that the outermost pocket of the sheath is fat , so one knife is pretty loose , that and it looks a bit weird.Still great beginner knives !	1
keep in mind i am not a god gifted thrower or a trained proProsnice and biglow priceone solid peice of metalConsno wrap on handlecrap sheathpoints were easily bendable	1
I did n't think I would like this as much as the other ones but it seems to be these are my favorite . They are very easy to throw and have an exellent point . A must have !	1
Nice quality , heavy and balanced . Throw nice and stick deep . Perfect size . Adequate sheath , although , I 'm going to buy another set and make a nice leather sheath for them . Can not be beat for the price !	1
I just started learning and have chosen the no spin throwing technique . These were a decent size and weight for me and have held up pretty well . The only time I broke the tip off of one was a missed throw striking asphalt . Now that I am a little more comfortable with throwing I will likely try something with more weight , but these were perfect to get started .	1
Some of the best knives I own , due to the size . The bigger the knife , the easier it is to control the spin . They are fairly sharp ( yet dont really need to be ) . The case is about as good as it gets when it comes to nylon cases . They throw really nicely and stick well . Very good for beginners . I would defiantly buy these again .	1
Great knife for a beginner such as myself ! Feels good in my hand , very balanced and releases well .	1
Good weight , very sharp , big enough to slow down the rotation and heavy enough to stick firmly .	1
No complaints . Highly recommended . These were my first pack of throwing knives and they are still sharp and fun to play with . I have a log in my basement and it still has no problem puncturing the wood .	1
Bought one to attach a sling to a rifle with picatinny rails , worked 100 % as expected . Biggest problem people make is not following the & # 34 ; tight is tight , too tight is broken & # 34 ; rule . DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN ANYTHING ... EVER !	1
This adapter is excellent and compact . Installation is quick and easy as would be expected and the swivel itself seems to be of excellent quality and all metal . Would gladly recommend to a friend .	1
This tool does the job perfectly . Do n't misuse it by applying a lot of torque . The front site must be held in with Loctite and when it is time to remove it the Loctite needs to be warmed.I would not have needed this tool if the store that installed my night sights had known this.You do n't want your night sights flying off unexpectedly because someone forgot the Loctite .	1
If you own a Glock , you 'll need this to change front sight . So easy change front sight in seconds just make sure to put a drop or two of lock tite .	1
Exactly as advertised , I 'm surprised how tiny it is for $ 10 but when your front sight comes loose and you need it ...	1
Application note , consider applying some blue loctite to your front sight screw and to the bottom of the front sight blade itself when mounting .	1
This is a high quality tool that does exactly what it is supposed to . Very nice tooling and good grip for ease of use .	1
This is intended to screw in front sight screws for Glocks , but worked for an aftermarket trijicon sight for my Walther PPQ . Works fine . Trouble is that it 's really expensive for a screwdriver . Unfortunately , normal screwdrivers do n't fit in the available space so you 're stuck buying this one . Buy amongst friends and share .	1
It fit fine removed the old front sight and installed the new one . Also cost one third of the Glock factory wrench . I have a wide selection of tools for various jobs , and realize that there is often a correlation between cost and quality of tools . Here I do not see this as the case .	1
Out of all the thousands of dollars of craftsman tools I own , I could n't get to that front sight nut ! ! As I own more than one Glock I had to buy this lil tool . It really works great & is the right tool for the job .	1
Nothing magic about this tool , and it 's nothing you couldnt make yourself out of an appropriately sized pipe or piece of barstock . Depending on what your time is work , $ 10 for this tool is well worth it .	1
Bought this tool to change my Glock sights . Used it on my G26 and my G30sf and worked well both times . You ca n't change a Glock front sight without one and this is a good one . There are more expensive tools out there but they do n't work any better or do anything this tool does n't do . Good buy .	1
I used this tool to installWalther P99 3 Dot Front And Rear Night Sight Seton my PPQ . Tool worked great for me .	1
Very specialized tool that does the job . It does leave a mark on the blued finish though . If you 're sensitive about small scratches get one made of brass .	1
If you 're going to change your front sights , you 've got to get this tool ! I have some sockets , nut drivers , etc . but the walls are too thick to do the job . There is minimal clearance from the head of the screw and this tool fits perfectly , I do n't see it wearing out or stripping , and it does n't cost much ! What 's not to like ? Now if we can find a rear sight tool that 's not ridiculously priced , we 'd be good to go .	1
These seem like really good quality tent stakes . They are nice and bright so they wont be lost easily and they came in a good sack to keep them stored in .	1
I used these up at the Kern River in the lower Sierras , so it was mainly loose sand . They went in extremely easy and navigated around rocks that would have certainly bent the cheap ones that came with the tent . I have n't tried the MSR ones , but these worked great .	1
These stakes are lightweight and have a nice finish . I was really surprised how hard they were to pull out of the ground , they really hold well . Recommend .	1
The stakes are great . Exactly what you 'd expect and want in a Y-beam . The puller is a bit odd . Not sure why I 'd want ultra-light stakes , and then haul this silly puller along . The included rope pulls work just fine ! If not , use the loops on your tent to yank the stakes out .	1
This is a set of eight ( 8 ) light strong stakes . Not as sexy as MSR groundhogs but they get the job done for less .	1
Pack of 8 Aluminum Tent Stakes Y Beam Design with Pull Cords ( Red , 9 & # 34 ; ) , does what its suppose to do , , gravel , sand , after 1st set I bought a 2nd set , , it got here b4 its ETA , well packaged , its a good buy	1
... more like a sirloin . A little less money then the best but also a little lower in quality . It all depends what you can live with I guess . I have MSR Groundhogs and I have these . Neither have failed me . I like the Y design . From a lay-mans point of view they look stronger than the j stake . So I would buy these again , no worries . More than adequate to get the job done .	1
So far , these are great ! We live in an area with rocky soil and , so far , I have not had one bend on me . I 've even been using my foot to push them in . Great value ! ***Update**First bent one last week . I was my fault ( i.e . rocky ground and me a little too enthusiastic ) . I intend on buying more in the near future as these are really nice stakes.More thoughts : the cord ( string ) that comes attached to the stakes is not the highest quality . While I have n't had it bread yet , I think I 'll replace it with some tech line for my own piece of mind.the paint is now wearing off but who cares ...	1
Awesome tent stakes	1
Yup . I took these out of the bag the next day after they were delivered and pounded them into a rocky shoreline on the Willamette river and they performed better than the [ shorter ] stakes that came with the tent . The metal is tough , the pull cords work great , and the anodization takes a beating and stays on the stakes . The carry sack is a nice touch too . Buy these . They are good .	1
I just ca n't stand the stock stakes that come with most tents and shelters . I 've been switching all my gear to these type of stakes . Maybe it is the places I end up camping but these always seem to hold up well and are super light weight . The only issue I have with these is the notches in the top . For guyline staking these are great , or if your tent as guyline loops or steel rings at the bottom of the stake points , but if you have 3/4 & # 34 ; or 1 & # 34 ; strapping at the stake points these may be a little challenging to work with.Several of the red string ties were completely off their associated stakes when I opened the package and the others had very loose knots that all needed to be retied .	1
Perfect , light , and were a great addition to my backpacking tent and camping supplies ... totally replaced the steel pins that came with the tent originally !	1
I live in Arizona , we have very hard rocky soil especially up north in the pines . Standard tent stakes never make it past the first use and resemble pretzels . These are the only way to go !	1
Experienced camper here , but by no means an expert . We 've been camping for the past few years near a beach and the ground is loosely packed sand with pine needles and tree roots and the occasional rock or shell . Those ridiculous little plastic stakes that come with most tents are useless for anything other than firm moist dirt . Last year we had a little wind and even our 9 inch plastic stakes kept coming up with the wind and anytime one of us nudged the guy line or tent . So this year I did some research and took the chance with these after more experienced sand campers recommended them - and some reviews in here too . Even after repeated trippings over the same guy line ( not on purpose , someone removed the glow stick ! ! ) , the stake did not come out or even budge . We did pound these deep into the sand at a 45 degree angle away from the tent so that the tops were not visible . We purchased the 9 inch length and though they look thin and weigh next to nothing ( perfect for backpackers ) , they worked wonderfully ! ! I 'm buying some more to have on hand in the event some get lost or forgotten . While these are great for guy lines , there is one minor possible issue with using these for tents - those little web strap loops , be sure to get them wedged into the little notch at the top of the stake as you hammer it in . Great price , great product and thanks to all the other thorough reviews on these !	1
Easy to install and sturdy . Installed in less than five minutes . Works well in the front pocket but I do n't use this method for a permanent , every day carry . I do n't carry the LCP very much - usually only in the summer with shorts and t-shirt , but it does work well . I do have some safety concerns , but I hope common sense would dictate that your finger always stays clear of the trigger , and nothing else is in the same pocket as the pistol . Again , this is not a method of carry that I would use every day - it 's just an item that helps if I need to throw the LCP in a pocket fast , and it works well for that purpose .	1
This was fairly easy to install and works quite well . The only drawback is that I can not use my Hogue grip with this installed . The clip itself is a great fit and works as advertised .	1
This clip is very excellent ! it is strong and will stay clipped on to pocket or waste band . It does not get in the way of shooting or operating the firearm and fixes to the gun very tight , no play at all . Clips over belt too but I clip mine under the belt . I recommend it to any one who has this gun .	1
Simple to install . IMO is a safe carry option since even though trigger is not covered , pull is so long and significant on LCP that ca n't believe gun could discharge inadvertently . Great concealment , less than a wallet or set of keys . T shirt , shorts , no problem . Not as quick draw as IWB holster , but still easy to access .	1
I got this as a gift for my buddy and had it engraved . It looks amazing and is super functional and a great design . Be sure to have a tube of ( blue ) locktite for the set screw to keep it from backing out .	1
I usually do n't carry a gun only because of the hassle and weight of it on my belt . I have found this to be a good alternative . IN addition to buying a smaller gun or course . Fits nicely in jeans pockets and on the belt line of sweatpants . ( something I never would do with my Sig P229 .40 cal . So I now carry most days	1
Extremely handy product . Much better than having to strap on a holster or pocket carry . Well made clip , fast shipping and good price . I bought one for my S & W .380 bodyguard also .	1
This gun clip attaches easily to the Ruger LCP .380 . Installation took approximately ten minutes and has a very secure fit to the weapon . It in no way interferes with the gun 's slide and it does not get in the way of handling the weapon at all in my opinion . This is a great alternative for those who wish to set their holsters aside and opt for complete concealment in your pocket . If you do not use any magazine grip extensions , the weapon can be easily concealed in one 's pocket . If you plan to use the clip with a grip extension , the weapon can still be easily and completely concealed in cargo pants pockets . The clip allows the weapon to fit very snug inside the cargo pocket or any pocket for that matter . In addition the Ruger can easily be un-holstered and re-holstered into a nylon holster . This is a great addition to any Ruger LCP .380 .	1
I love this little clip ! It installs within a few minutes even for a rookie like myself . I live in FL so all I have to do is throw it in my short 's pocket !	1
gift for father in-law he likes this a lot . I have carried his gun with the clip , as well . the clip and the gun are now on my list of things to get for myself .	1
I ordered one for my LCP to use for more concealed carry options . I use to carry mainly in my front pocket with a Galco pocket holster but wanted more options . I could not find a comfortable inside waistband holster , they all added too much bulk- I live in a warn climate and dress light and in basketball shorts a lot of the time . This clip makes the gun super comfortable to carry- just be extra careful as it leaves the trigger exposed.My only gripe is that it 's expensive for what it is- just a simple stamped piece of metal . I think you can easily modify the clip that works for the Kel-Tek P3AT which is much cheaper , but I got this one so I did n't have to jury rig anything .	1
The Venum Challenger 2.0 Boxing Gloves are a better than decent pair of boxing gloves for the amateur boxer , krav maga , student , or anyone else wanting a 16 oz . pair of gloves . In fact , they are a very good pair of gloves , especially for the price . The gloves are made from synthetic leather , have an attached thumb , and a wide Velcro wrist strap that secures the glove and gives decent support to the wrists . I have not discovered any problems with the quality or workmanship of these gloves.These are 16 ounce gloves , so there is a little size to them , but they are not big balloons either . You definitely feel it when hit with them , and they do a good job of protecting the hands when punching . Obviously , wearing hand wraps inside of the gloves provides better protection and is recommended if you are doing serious training or boxing . There are a few small holes for ventilation in the palm and thumb , which help a little when sweating inside , but not a lot . ( It 's not like the gloves breath , they do n't . ) With that said , the lining is a comfortable kind of nylon or something and is still comfortable when sweating . We 'll have to see how they hold up over time.You can see in the pictures that they have VENUM very large on the glove and then the snake head and Venum again on the wrist wrap . I have the black pair with white lettering , but there are other color options . I personally would prefer a smaller logo on the wrist strap and nothing on the main part of the glove , but that 's just me . I like plain and simple.If you are looking for a pair of 16 oz . boxing gloves , the Venum Challenger 2.0 Boxing Gloves are a good buy for training or sparring .	1
I 'll admit , I 've never really worn boxing gloves . I 've been practicing various martial arts since 1997 , so I 've mainly used gloves for karate and most recently , mixed martial arts . My little brother has gotten into it recently as well , and got a nice pair of Venum MMA gloves for Christmas last month . They were very well-made , and while I did n't like the way they felt on my hands , I could see that this is quality stuff up there with Hayabusa . When these Challenger gloves were up for grabs , I figured I 'd give them a try . Training with gloves heavier than what I usually wear is a good way to improve speed . Plus these wo n't be wearing out as fast as lighter gloves.First things first- these gloves are made of PU leather , as in synthetic leather . They are NOT made of real leather . It 's listed in the product description above , and is obvious as soon as you feel them . That being said , the gloves are pretty stiff and well-padded . There 's no denying that getting hit with one of these , even a quick jab , is going to wake you up . Being new to the boxing glove style , I was surprised by the size . They 're not as big as I expected ( that 's a good thing ) and I liked seeing multiple holes for breathability on the palm side . The velcro closure wraps around once with one large square of velcro . Normally , I would be against this because two or three is ideal to make sure there 's nearly no risk of the gloves coming off during intense training . But you know what ? These guys have a snug fit , and are as tight as a nun when you 're wearing hand wraps too.The overall design is pretty good , although I 'm not exactly a fan of snakes ... or venom . Still , it works and there are other colors available . I 'm really big on that green scale look that is n't listed here . The gloves look exactly the same as they do in the stock images above . No worries about them showing a prototype here.I 'm taking off one star for two reasons- one kinda silly and the other for a more reasonable issue . Another reviewer mentioned that they had a rough spot inside the gloves along the fingers . One pair I got had this same issue , and closing my hands was very uncomfortable . I got another pair and everything was fine . As usual with fighting gear , or sporting gear of any kind , try it out for yourself in a store if you can before ordering . It 's better to pay a few extra bucks for something that you 're comfortable with rather than having to send something back and risk getting the same problem again . My other , small gripe , is the 'Designed in Thailand ' on the glove 's tag . It 's even printed right there on the velcro strap under the Venum logo . & # 34 ; Designed in & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; Made in & # 34 ; are two very different things , and as I expected , the gloves are made in China ( look on the tag inside the gloves for yourself ) . Come on guys , what are you trying to do ? Seem more hardcore because Muay Thai fighters are some of the toughest out there ? Just drop the act and be more upfront.I ca n't see anyone being disappointed with how these gloves perform . I 'll definitely keep them around for sparring partners of mine who do n't have their own gloves . Great for sparring and bag work , these are solid gloves worth the money .	1
I am no where near a pro , or even an amateur , however I do hit the gym for at least 6-7 classes a week . The gloves have held up great . When they arrived , they are stiff so be prepared to break them in . However once you break them in they are good to go . Tons of padding , and the Velcro ensures a snug fit . These are NOT real leather gloves and so they have a very strong vinyl type of smell . If that is an absolute deal breaker for you then go out and buy the $ 100+ gloves . As for me , I will continue to use these .	1
These gloves are firm , heavy , and pack a mean punch . They are made of a heavy vinyl that looks like it will hold up well . They fit an average-sized hand . I 'm certainly no expert on boxing gloves , but these seem like a good pair for the price .	1
I did not get these to fight with , I am a lover not a fighter . I did however get them to decorate my office with because I work in a hostile environment and I wanted these ladies to know I am not beyond putting my dukes up . That said , they are so well made , and fit on even my small hands comfortably . They are sturdy material , breathable , and workable to your hand shape .	1
I , and my family members are using these gloves to workout or to punch away stress and anger with a heavy bag.These are comfortable . The wrist straps are velcro and help get a good fit . This allows different people in our family spanning 35 years in age and young teen to adult man and adult woman to be able to wear the same gloves.The logo on the glove is showy but I do n't take issue with it.I rate this product 5 stars = I Love It .	1
Although these gloves are not leather , they seem very sturdy and durable . They have good knuckle protection and sturdy wrist wraps . The only thing I do n't like about them so far is that they are extremely stiff . It will definitely take a while to break them in .	1
These are great set of starter gloves . They are of great quality . Excellent work on the stitching and materials . Due to the synthetic use of materials these gloves do have a strong smell . Just air them out in the open air outside and they 'll be fine . The fit is excellent . I do n't have large beefy hands . I can wrap my hands and still be able to put these gloves on . They are fairly easy to put on due to the velcro and the large wrap that goes around the wrist . It holds tight and does n't loosen as you use the gloves . The velcro is really tough and strong . They are the best breathing gloves in my opinion . I do tend to sweat more . At first you will probably get blistered up if you never used gloves . After your skin toughens up and gets used to the beating you will be fine and dandy . The cushion is great on these gloves too . They are firm and not soft . The gloves are really great for those starting out .	1
These gloves are made of synthetic leather and not real leather . They are made of polyurethane which allows them to make a more reasonable priced boxing glove . It also gives a great option of colors and the ability to make these wicked looking gloves . These are full size 16 ounce boxing gloves with a thick and strong Velcro strap that holds them securely in place . They are n't coming off your hand once they are strapped on . They are very padded and have small ventilation holes at the palm of your hands and on the thumb as well . The interior of the gloves have a black colored , smooth , cool and comfortable lining . They feel nice on your hand and very professional . The exterior is black and gray with Venum printed down the glove . On the Velcro band there is a sweet looking snake head with Venum printed on it . They have an intimidating look to them . It has a thick wrist wrap for protection . I would imagine that almost any adult or young adult could use these gloves because they are pretty much one size fits all . I love both the look and feel of these gloves and I enjoy wearing them a lot . They also seem like they are good quality to me and I think they should last a long time . The only negative thing that I have noticed about them is the strong smell . I know that is typical of synthetic leather but it has a very strong smell when you first take them out of the bag . It took several days before most of the smell went away . While the smell was strong it went away and did n't influence my opinion much on these gloves .	1
These Venum gloves are good for boxing , sparring , MMA , etc . For me , I use them for sparring sessions in my Krav Maga training . In this case , the sparring is more to get used to moving around , regulating breathing while in combat , and learning to take hits and keep fighting . Boxing gloves work fine for that ( ca n't use them when practicing actual Krav moves like palm strikes , grabs , escape moves , etc ) .I have a medium build and these fit just fine . I 'm able to get them on and off myself , without using my teeth . I can hit a BOB sparring dummy full force and not feel anything on my knuckles , and I can spar with a partner and not break his/her jaw . They certainly are a worthy addition to my overall training bag .	1
I have using boxing as a way to exercise my arms and get some toning in my arms and upper body . I have an Everlast heavy bag that I have been using these with and they are the best boxing gloves I have ( I also have a pair of Everlast Pro Style Training ) . These gloves are great for the heavy bag and offer great support for my hands . I would not say they were a great choice for sparring for fun ( training ) , since the front of these gloves are very hard ( getting hit by these would hurt like crazy ) . However , for the heavy bag or a well protected practice round these are great . They fit my hands perfectly and my fingers go in perfectly and can easily form the proper shape in the gloves . The fingers are in the glove perfectly , but I do have some movement in the thumb ( not much ) . The gloves are super high quality and feel really high end , they also look pretty cool with the Venum logos . The gloves have Velcro that wraps around the wrist which is much easier to get on and off compared the the Everlast that just wrap under the wrist ( these actually nearly go all the way around , making it easier to put on and off [ more to grab on to and pull with ] , even with the other glove on ) .In the end the these are super high quality gloves . They fit and look amazing ! The longer Velcro holds them on nicely and makes putting on gloves easy . I wear these over Everlast EverGel Hand Wraps and they fit perfectly . The gloves are harder on the end which makes hitting the heavy bag a stronger workout , but if sparring with someone ( on a friendly level ) you could really hurt them ( these are not as cushioned on the end as my Everlast Training ) . However , for an actual fight these would be great ( I mainly stick with the heavy bag ) . These are really nice and highly recommend these ! ! ! I have been using these almost exclusively ( not using the Everlast anymore ) since these offer a better fit and the longer Velcro makes these easier to get on and off !	1
From the Mixed Martial Arts & related close combat sports company Venum comes the Venum Challenger 2.0 boxing gloves.I 'm not really sure of the difference between the first version and the second but I do know that these gloves fit snug in my hands , they are well padded with PU leather and triple density foam , and just one knock to the chin with these gloves , just barely and you can feel how these gloves pack a wallop.The stitching is very good on these gloves and a large velcro strap definitely holds the gloves in place.I have big hands but they fit good and snug via the 16-ounce version . Even if I taped my fists up , it would fit nicely with these gloves.And for under $ 50 , these gloves are very well-designed . For those who want breathability for their gloves , may want to look into Everlast 's ProTex2 Evergel 's ( which are a little cheaper ) but in terms of holding power , the Venum Challengers are a very good fit and once again , price , comfort , the padding and how good the hold is thanks to the velcro make these gloves really worth owning , if you are on a budget.But no matter how well padded these gloves are , it 's always important to note that despite the padding , it 's still important for one to wear cotton wraps or gel wraps or ( gauze/tape ) to protect your muscles and tendons in your hands/wrist and it provides additional support to the wrist ( you 'll often read people who use gloves without these and somehow injure their hands ) .Otherwise , for those with a bigger budget and wanting engineered-leather ala Vylar and years of research in terms of materials and are on a bigger budget , then the Hayabusa/Tokushu gloves are the ones to go for.As for Venum Challenger 2.0 boxing gloves , for gloves under $ 50 , these are well-constructed and are recommended !	1
First off : These are BOXING gloves and not MMA gloves . However , if you are attending KICKBOXING , then you should definitely consult with your instructor to see if these are allowed in your class . Some schools require a certain type of gloves , so you should always ask before shelling money out.Venum challenger are indeed around 16 ounces ( They were lingering between 15.8 and 15.9 on my scale . ) These are also very well padded , so when you punch , you will feel that extra & # 34 ; oomph & # 34 ; of power , which should give you a feeling that your punch is harder than it really is , which ultimately should raise your confidence . These gloves have velcro straps , so you can adjust them to your comfort level . Finally they also look very stylish with that rattlesnake design , along with great color schemes . You should also air these out or buy a spray because once the sweat is inside , it is very hard to get rid of , so take care of these and they will take care of you .	1
These are comfortable and work well for training . I have smaller hands so they 're not as tight a fit as I 'd like them to be . For the price , they seem to be a good value .	1
These gloves were great as I strapped them on the day I received them . I let loose on the 100 pound bag and it felt great . They fit my hands perfectly it felt as it did on my uncle , brother and such . They felt good and light enough and worked for the work out , great pair of gloves .	1
There & # 8217 ; s a lot to like about these gloves -- how they feel and how they perform.These gloves are secure feeling , even without tape under them . They have a solid feel and are well padded , enough to let me hit longer than normal . I really like the way they feel . My old gloves are hand-me-downs and they have definitely seen better days.The 16 ounce are still lightweight that they didn & # 8217 ; t bother my arms or make me tire more quickly . I never would have chosen the 16 ounce on purpose , but I am glad to have them at this weight . It all combines to let me hit harder.My old gloves were kind of old and damaged and I needed to use a lot of tape under them to avoid hurting my hands . These are an amazing replacement . I even like the design . I am like a dragon wearing them !	1
The Venum Challenger 2.0 is a professional high quality glove . Designed for use in MMA , these are not the traditional boxing/sparring gloves with the majority of the padding bulking up the top knuckles of the gloves . As you can see in the item picture , the Venum Challenger has slim curved padding over the knuckles . The stitching is tight , the construction is perfect , no flaws visible . Quality materials . The Venom is closed palm and the inside of glove is a nylon material over foam - comfortable and no smell so far !	1
When I took these gloves out of their box , a very strong scent of petroleum products overwhelmed my senses ... I hope this smell will wear off because it stinks ! Apart from that , these gloves are good looking.The feeling is not that great for my hands , specially the part where my fingertips are meeting the glove . Not that comfortable.I will indeed have to see how the gloves fare on the long range .	1
I bought these for bag-work . I also punch things with them.They are a comfortable and stylish glove . I 'm not a professional boxer , but I am a martial artist and they protect my wee precious hands for pad drills and bag-work.I have n't hit anybody in the head with them yet , but they seem well suited for that . I 'm not sure if they 're regulation , or not , but they sure are nice for training . They are extremely durable , so you should be able to keep them around for many many rounds of sparring .	1
These boxing gloves are a one-size fits all ( youths and adults ) made of synthetic leather and are full size 16 ounces in weight , with a good strap to hold them in place . For the price the durability and intimidating colors ca n't be beat .	1
I & # 8217 ; ve always had an interest in the martial arts and use a punching bag for exercise/stress relief . When I had a chance to order these gloves I took advantage of it.First , they are not real leather , but very durable and well-made . I & # 8217 ; ve dealt with badly made gloves before . These aren & # 8217 ; t. In addition , the Velcro straps work very well . I & # 8217 ; ve never had any sort of slipping and they & # 8217 ; ve never come undone.These gloves certainly pack a punch . I can go full throttle on my punching bag and barely feel a thing . In addition , the heaviness of the gloves adds more to the workout . I & # 8217 ; ve never tried them in a sparring match ( since I rarely get the chance ) , but I & # 8217 ; m sure they & # 8217 ; d be great.I & # 8217 ; m a pretty little guy , so the gloves are pretty big on me . But , even then , they still fit well . I just have to pull the Velcro a little tighter.Also , they look really cool . And , that matters.A friend of mine , who has more boxing and fighting experience asked to try them on and test them out and loved them enough to go buy a pair too.Overall , they & # 8217 ; re great . If you want reasonably priced , durable gloves , you won & # 8217 ; t be disappointed .	1
I really like these gloves . I have fairly large hands , with about nine and a half inches around the knuckles . Insertion of the hands is initially snug , and once on , the tip of my thumbs felt squeezed tight . With just enough room between the thumbs and index fingers for the bulk of the wrap , and after initial break in the squeeze in the thumb eases off , and the gloves eventually came to fit perfectly . The combination of firm padding and the ridge along the exterior of the palm just below the knuckles provides enduring protection throughout sessions . With no interior play whatsoever , these come to comfortably feel like a natural extension of the hands.I love the sick-looking graphics , and the embossed Venum logo on the wrist strap . The construction quality is excellent . These are awesome gloves for the price . I highly recommend Venum Challenger 2.0 Boxing Gloves . They not only fit remarkably , but also perform wonderfully . I am completely satisfied with my selection .	1
These gloves have been in use at my household for about one month now . I got two pairs of gloves and my 11-year son has had a grand old time boxing anyone he can - his sister , his friends , me , etc . My pair of Venum Challenger 's is the 16 ounce version and my 11-year old son reports they are very comfortable when he wears them.The quality is good - they appear durable . They are attractive looking . My only gripe is that they are on the firmer side ( ie , you feel it more when you are hit ) - our second set of gloves is a different Venom model and they are softer . Still , these gloves are more than adequate for bag work or boxing with light punches.At $ 50 the price is reasonable for the quality - overall I rate 4-stars in consideration of price/value ( 5 stars if they were a bit softer ) .	1
I had been toying with the idea of picking up some boxing gloves as I was thinking about incorporating a little more fight training into my exercise regimen . I 'm not a serious fighter , though , or even someone who can consistently stick to a regular work-out schedule . So when I looked at the price point of most commercially available gloves , it seemed like a hefty investment for something I might or might not use . For me , the primary selling point for the Venum Challenger 2.0 Boxing Gloves , therefore , is its reasonable price point . For about $ 50 ( current non-sale price ) , these are solid and effective gloves.I have the black gloves in the 16 oz size . I like to think my hands are average size , and the gloves fit securely over the fist with a velcro strap to attach around your wrist area . Perfectly snug and comfortable . I find the gloves to be lightweight and yet still extremely powerful . I would recommend wearing them down on a bag , though , before attempting them in a friendly spar . When I first got the gloves , my friends thought their impact was rather punishing but I suspect that this is only natural . Working on a bag , however , this reinforcement really does protect your hand.I 'm not going to rave over these boxing gloves , but I am perfectly pleased with their performance , their price , and their fit . As I 've never had a pricier model , I do n't have the ability to compare them to higher end gloves . But for everyday workout needs , these fit the bill ( in more ways than one ) for me . KGHarris , 2/14 .	1
These fit a bit snug but not too much , depending on how thick your wraps are . They 're well made and will probably last a good while . For the price , they 're a good starter glove , if perhaps a little thin for some beginnners.My main qualm is that combined with the tiny little vent holes , the synthetic leather does n't breathe at all , and after a few workouts , my usually not too sweaty paws got these pretty damp , even with wraps . And since they do n't breathe even when not on the hands , they get smelly pretty darn fast . Yes , most gloves do , but real leather ones breathe far better than these , and do n't seem to make my hands as sweaty . They do n't get as stinky so quickly either.For bag work , these will do fine . And perhaps for ring work , they 'd be good if you can get your hands near your opponent 's nose , and hold them there for a second. & # 34 ; Winnerrrrrr , in the first rooooound , by SKO -- -knock out by smell -- -it 's Kid Funky ! & # 34 ;	1
I 've been using these gloves for the past few weeks at kickboxing class , they fit well and by the end of the class I really feel the weight . These also work well for bag work , but be aware these gloves are very hard and I would n't want to get hit by them . Keep this in mind if you plan to spar with anyone , I 'm certain they wo n't appreciate it if you wear these gloves .	1
Since I started doing heavy bag workouts in my basement , I 've been using the Everlast gloves that came with it . They 're great gloves , but I had the opportunity to try out the Venom Challenger 2.0 gloves , so I gave them a shot.Out of the box , the first thing I noticed is that are probably 30 % bigger than the Everlast gloves . They are BIG gloves . However , after wrapping my wrists , I found that the gloves were pretty snug on my hands , so much so that I really had to work to get them in the gloves . I 'm a 5 ' 11 & # 34 ; guy , but I have pretty small hands , so make sure you get the correct size for you . One think that separates these gloves from the Everlasts is that they come farther down your wrist , but there 's foam padding around the wrists for extra support . As someone with chronic tendonitis , I really appreciate the fact they implemented this feature into the gloves.The gloves themselves appear to built to last . The construction seems well done and I ca n't imagine them wearing down over time . As others have noted , the logo is VERY large . It 's not a deal-breaker by any stretch , but I love the Everlasts for their simple , classic black design.After using them for several workouts , I think I 'll go back to the Everlasts , but only because I feel the Venom 's are too large for my physique . However , try them on if you can and see if they fit right for you . They 're certainly well-made and affordable .	1
I go fitness kickboxing with my wife ( when I 'm not training jiu jitsu ) and up till now we 've been using super-cheap RevGear and Title gloves.Compared to those , the Venum Challenger fits about 2 & # 34 ; further up the arm to give better wrist support , it 's a bit stiffer ( the 12 oz . RevGears are so soft you can literally open your hand all the way , which might contribute more to injury ) , the thumb feels more secure , they feel more durable and they sure look a lot cooler ! I got the 16 oz . gloves for the extra padding and better training potential ( heavier weight = better workout ) , plus they 're better for sparring.They felt a little tight around the index finger for me , but they 'll certainly be my go-to gloves for my training ! I love them !	1
These Venum Challenger 2.0 Boxing Gloves are lightweight , easy to wear and seem to function just fine . They were a perfect fit for me and I have no issues with them . Recommended .	1
Size : I 'm a female and when I buy gloves , I buy the large female size . These fit me about right . The velcro wrist straps binds tightly but I have to use small wraps because there is not much room inside for wrapping . If I 'm going to be punching a lot , I switch gloves so that I can have the support of normal wrapping.Weight : I love the 16oz . Allows me to build some arm muscle and gives a nice workout.Construction : These are made of faux-leather . They are very sturdy . They are well-padded , but the padding is hard , if you want to spare without pulling punches , these are not the gloves to wear - unless of course you are seriously training - of course , those training for competitions would probably be using a more expensive glove.These are well made gloves . Well-padded and the fit is good . I wish that there were more flexibility in the fingers - I like to be able to roll my fingers most of the way into a fist when punching . I use them in a Muay Thai class and by the end of class my hands are soaking wet . In order to keep them from smelling , I have to blow dry them between uses . It would have been nice if they had been made of something more breathable .	1
Right out of the box , I noted all the updates and evolution from the old school gloves I 'm used to . I 'll try to cover everything I see and feel with these . . . . These are black 16 oz gloves with bold white `` Venum '' graphics and some white accent trim on the cuff straps . I like the design on the straps , which is actually embossed into the vinyl . I 'm not as wild about the flashy Venum work that printed onto the body of the gloves . I prefer things a little more understated . There is also a small script on the cuff , `` Designed in Thailand '' . The gloves are Made in China.These gloves are not leather , but rather `` synthetic leather '' ( i.e . some type of poly/vinyl ) . That said , they seem tough and durable , and so far there are no damage issues . The material is plenty pliable and I do n't think there would be any injury issues either . Other reviewers have complained about the smell , but I really do n't have a problem with these . Although they lack a wonderful new leather smell , the odor from the synthetics is neither strong not disagreeable , and remotely evokes a `` new car '' sensation . With use ( sweating ) the scent has dissipated a bit , but nothing negative has developed.The striking surface is all smooth with no seams . The thumbs are tethered to the side of the palm . There are a few small ( pencil lead sized ) ventilation hole in the inner palm/thumb , a total of 9 . More about ventilation later.Putting them on . . . My hands are medium large ( male ) and these gloves are a pretty good fit . A little room is still there for a wrap or maybe slightly larger hands . If you have meaty big man 's hands , these gloves are likely too small to wear comfortably or even get on . They fasten via a single wide wrist strap incorporating elastic and Velcro . I like it . Fastens easily , stays put , and the gloves are on securely and do n't move around . Complete inner lining of a slick nylon type material . These gloves are very firmly shaped to the fist . Feels a little disagreeable while slipping them on , but once in place it 's a pretty nice feel . There 's a bit of extra padding in the palm for your hand to roll around . I have two fit issues worth commenting on ; As I said these gloves are firmly formed to the fist . However , it 's not quite a fully closed fist . I feel like I 'm expending hand energy keeping my fist closed . Becomes tiresome and it 's not `` breaking in '' much . And , the thumb compartment seems a bit too roomy . My thumbs move around way too much and I prefer they were held more snugly.The workout . . . I have n't sparred with these so far , just bag work . The highlight of the gloves is the padding on the strike surfaces . Dense and firm . Great hand protection . In sparring/fighting , these would definitely ring an opponent 's bell . Maybe even a little too dense for casual sparring . Again , the protection seems great . Personally , I like the 16 oz weight . It 's all I 've ever had on , so maybe it just feels natural to me . Plenty of protection , and affords a little extra arm workout . And finally , my last complaint - In addition to the closed fist and thumb fit issues , I sweat A LOT in these gloves . I 've never used synthetic material gloves before , and they just do n't breathe ( of course ) . The sweat actually seems to pool in there and the 9 little vent holes just do n't make up for it.In all , a well built glove affording excellent protection . In my opinion , the synthetic material causes a bit of a shaping nuisance that may not wear in quickly , and a breathing deficiency that will always be there . Should prove to be durable .	1
These worked fine and fit comfortably . Not much else I was looking for in a pair of boxing gloves as this is n't something I do a lot .	1
My 5'4 daughter trains with professional fighters and this pair of gloves fit her perfectly . They did not slide around without wraps , with the full wrap they were perfect . One star down for the & # 34 ; obnoxious & # 34 ; huge logo on the face of the glove . Placing it on the Velcro was enough . The weight and stiffness were just fine for her . Her 6'5 boyfriend could not fit his hand in even without wraps . The thumb was way too tight , the ridge fell in the wrong spot and the whole thing felt like squeezing a watermelon into a grape skin . So , if you are small frame , like to spar hard with full contact , and do n't mind a little brazen advertising on your gear , these gloves might be a five star . If you have meaty hands or are tall these might not work at all .	1
I 've purchased other DeSantis Scabbards and just like the others this was a quality holster . Weapon draws nice and the holster fits nice . No re-adusting every two seconds .	1
On summer days , I put this holster on when I carry my S & W Shield in 40 SW . The fits is perfect and the angle of the draw is perfect .	1
THIS IS A PERFECT FIT WELL MADE QUALITY MATERIALTHIS A HOLSTER THAT YOU CAN WEAR ALL THE TIME AND NOT FEEL THE GUNWITH THUMB LOCK YOU WO N'T DROP THE GUN AND IT RELEASE 'S FAST	1
I was lucky enough to buy a S & W ; .40 cal shield then I could n't find a decent holster . My department said I needed a retention screw and thumbbreak . This holster did the job and more . Rides nicely on my belt , easy to work the thumb break . And above all my .40 cal Shield fit perfect in this holster with no break in period.Absolutely the perfect holster for a S & W ; Shield . Now I want a brown one too .	1
This holster fit my M & P 9mm Shield perfectly right out of the package . I carry OWB in the winter because of coats and extra layers . I highly recommend this holster .	1
Usually I use the 2 loop OWB holsters , but I thought I would give this a try.It is very well made and holds the gun close to my side . The advantage I found with this one over the 2 loop style is if you need to move this one slightly you can . It dose n't move on it 's own but you can slide it a little if you need to . It 's also faster to put on then the other style . Overall I 'm very pleased with this purchase .	1
Got this Holster fast . Just what i was looking for to fit my Smith Shield . I have purchased my last 3 Holsters on Amazon and very satisfied .	1
Holster fit perfect with no break in Needed , I do n't have eleven words left to add to this revied & # 34 ; Ended .	1
I purchased this phone to upgrade from my LG Optimus V , purchased a year and a half ago . I decided to purchase the HTC One V instead of theHTC EVO V 4G Prepaid Android Phone ( Virgin Mobile ) because I do not have 4G available in my area . If I did , I 'm still not sure I 'd want to pay the extra for it , as the 3G on the HTC One V is quite quick ! I bought aOtterBox 77-20718 Commuter Series Hybrid Case for HTC One V - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Blackto use with the phone and will be doing a separate review of it , but suffice to say it provides excellent protection for the phone with a few small issues that can be overlooked in order to get the phone protected.What do I like about the HTC One V ? It 's very lightweight , sleek in its design , super responsive with the Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich operating system and it has an excellent GPS . The screen is bright - too bright for me on 100 % , and the 5.0MP camera with zoom takes excellent photos even in low light thanks to the built-in flash . It also takes great 720 HD video and you can snap up to 20 photos in succession while video recording ! Very cool feature.Transferring contacts from your old phone to the HTC is super easy thanks to an icon on the phone that gives you the option to do it over Bluetooth . I did it and after turning on the old phone and the new one , both with the Bluetooth on , the whole process took only a few minutes to transfer over 200 contacts.Watching YouTube videos over the 3G connection ( Sprint network for Virgin Mobile ) is great on this phone . The LG Optimus V never did it for very long without bogging down , but the HTC One has the power to do it and quickly ! Facebook and Twitter uploads of photos are also speedy with this phone.Call quality is excellent , and voice dialing a breeze . Google searches via voice , and even emailing and texting via Google voice is great ! The Beats audio is noticeable even withSkullcandy Titan In Ear Bud S2TTDZ-033 ( Black/Black ) , but would be that much better withBeats by Dr. Dre Tour High-Resolution In-Ear Headphones from Monsteror another Beats product . I enjoy both my own music on a microSD card ( not included ) andTuneIn Radioon this phone.I appreciate the features of this phone at the low price point and no-contract . I use the Beyond Talk $ 35 plan ( I had the $ 25 plan , but they would n't allow me to keep it when I changed phones ... ) and have 300 minutes , and unlimited text and data . An outstanding value that can be truly appreciated with the speed of the HTC One V.What do n't I like about the HTC One V ? Not crazy about the battery life . I 'm sure that once I figure out how to turn things off to conserve it , that will help . For now it 's about 4 hours with heavy video , Facebook and music useage . About 10 hours on standby . The manual says to charge the phone when not using it , indicating you do n't need to wait for a full discharge of the battery . Time will tell if that 's a good or bad thing.I wish it had more internal memory . You can add up to 32GB on a microSD card , which can hold videos , music and photos , but large apps wo n't necessarily work on this phone . You may find you need to get rid of some to add others.The HTC One V is a definite step up from the LG Optimus line . I think the operating system is the main reason , but perks like the 5.0MP camera with a flash , HD video , superior GPS and Beats audio for the same money as theLG Optimus Elite Prepaid Android Phone ( Virgin Mobile ) make this a 9 out of 10 in my book , even with the lack of internal memory and battery life.No , it 's not an iPhone , nor is it 4G , but if you 're paying $ 35- $ 55 on the Beyond Talk plan for Virgin Mobile and not under contract - this is a sweet phone and in my opinion , the best of their current sub- $ 200 phone offerings.As an added perk to this phone , you get 23GB of FREE Dropbox space for 2 years with this purchase . Nice for storing video , photos and large attachment files from emails.Free Apps you might enjoy : Scanner Radio , Zedge ( wallpapers and ringtones for free ... ) , Pinterest , Amazon Price Check , Gemini App Manager , App2SD ( send apps to your storage card versus leaving on internal memory ... ) , and Cozi Family Organizer.Do n't hesitate to get this one if you want to enjoy Facebook , YouTube videos , taking great photos and video , GPS navigation , and enjoying your music , as well as making and receiving clear calls on the Virgin Mobile ( Sprint ) network.UPDATE : 9/11/12The camera on this thing rocks ! Lots of tweaks possible with panorama , portrait , HDR , group portrait , whiteboard , landscape , close-up ( macro ) , low light and auto . You can also turn off the flash or put it on automatic . It has a self-timer , you can change the ISO , make exposure , contrast , saturation , and sharpness adjustments . You can change the white balance to incandescent , flurescent , daylight , cloudy , and geo-tag photos . It has an auto face and smile capture detection , and an auto upload feature . Continuous shooting is very cool , with up to 20 frames in a row possible . You have up to 1080x720 HD video quality possible with the camera in this phone ! That alone makes it for me . You can adjust the image resolution downward from 5MP ( 2592 x 1552 ) , but why ? ! Awesome camera ! So much more than expected . I love it . Boosting the review from 4 to 5 stars . This phone has it all and does it very well for less.UPDATE : 9/25/12The initial poor battery life has been replaced with AMAZING battery life . What happened ? I took the advice of another reviewer and let the battery completely deplete itself with normal use - YouTube , Facebook , photo and video taking , texting , GPS use and calling , and then fully recharged it.The phone learns your useage patterns and optimizes the battery accordingly . I could n't believe I still had juice in this thing after five days ! I 'm not a power-user , but with the LG Optimus V I was lucky to get 1 days worth of use before a much needed charge.Kudos to HTC on this beautifully functioning Android phone ! UPDATE : 7/8/13Virgin Mobile addedVirgin Mobile - Apple Iphone 4s 16gb Memory No-contract Mobile Phone - Whiteto their line up a month or two ago , so I switched my service from the HTC One V to the iPhone . There 's a noticeable boost in performance ; even using the same 3G network , but I 'm keeping the One in reserve . It 's a good phone which served me well.I still recommend it for its Android performance and features .	1
I just got back into the smart phone world and things have changed while I was gone.I did a lot of reading on phones and carriers and making a decision was a hard one.In the end , the phone I wanted was the HTC Evo V. It was the perfect phone for what I want ( note : want , not need ) but it carried a $ 300 price tag.Another phone I considered is the LG Optimus Elite . That is a perfect phone for what I need and only carried a $ 120 price tag.Comparing them , and also looking at this phone , I get a good compromise at a compromised price.Also factoring in is the fact that I was buying multiple phones for my family and I ended up buying the LG Optimus Elite as well ( so you can check that review too ) . The last factor was a sale where this phone was $ 150 instead of the standard $ 200.So what do I think of this phone ? It is really nice . I am extremely happy with it.The screen is excellent . Seriously excellent . Bright and deep colors , and a clean resolution that makes using it so much better.One reason I opted for this phone is Ice Cream Sandwich . Is this version of the OS so much better than previous ones ? No . But it does have some really nice features such as being able to combine items into folders.The phone is quick and responsive , and I never seem to have any issues or lag with it.Battery life seems mediocre . Not bad , not good . What I would expect from any smart phone . I make sure to use a task manager app to kill anything I am not using to extend the power.I seem to be able to get a day 's use on a charge with no heavy usage.There are two physical features of the phone I really was leery of before buying.One is the obvious slant at the bottom of the phone . Style wise I did n't really like it but was more concerned with how it will fit in my pocket etc ... In reality , the slant does n't bother me one bit . Sure , I would n't have designed it that way myself , but it does n't get in the way or annoy me.The other thing is that the screen of this phone is slightly raised from the body.I really did n't like that at all and thought it would collect a lot of lint and dust on the edges . This also does n't really bother me . My case covers the left and right sides so it is n't an issue , and the top does n't collect anything at all . The bottom does a bit , just because of the slant of the phone , but it is n't bad and in using the phone I do n't even notice the screen is raised . So my two biggest hesitations are not really issues at all.End result : This is an excellent mid-range phone these days . It has nice , strong specs , but nothing so super that it blows other phones away . For a mid range price this is a great phone .	1
I bought this as a gift for someone who had the same model but broke it . After trying 8 different stores it was nice to find it online . The price is even lower then that of the store I originally purchased it from the first time . She loves it and uses it a lot . My only issue is it is kind of an underpowered android phone . Much better ones on the market but she likes it and that is all that matters .	1
One of my best purchases . I got this when it was on a lightning deal for about $ 50 . I feel I got a steal . Great product as well .	1
I 'd been stuck with a Droid X on another big carrier for nearly 2 years and my X started acting wacky , and since the X was out of warranty my options were to buy an expensive upgrade or walk away from it . Since I had Virgin Mobile phones for my wife and kid I took the leap and walked . Happy I did.I 'd gotten my wife an Optimus Elite a few weeks before and it is definitely a nice little phone for the price , and was thinking about getting one for myself , but I was leaning towards going the power route and getting the Evo V 4G . Luckily - just in time , as they just came out - I ran across the HTC One V first . After a bit of research and weighing the options , I decided that I was tired of carrying around big , bulky phones , and that I really did n't need the extra power and capability the Evo has , so I picked up a One V. I do n't talk much , use texting more , so the $ 35/month plan fits me perfectly , and at that price and for only $ 200 up front this is a steal . Now , to the phone itself ... It is a very compact phone , very light , yet does not at all feel cheap . No plastic backing , this one has a real aluminum unibody that both looks and feels great and offers much better protection than cheaper plastic units . It has Gorilla Glass on the screen as well , so right out of the box this phone is more solidly constructed than most of the competition . I dropped it my second day ( my hands still being used to gripping a big-screened monstrosity ) and it took quite a tumble before it hit the floor , picked it up and brushed it off , not a scratch and kept walking . It has a no frills appearance to it that I find aesthetically pleasing as well . Slides right in and out of the pocket , do n't even notice it 's there . I like that coming from a big phone that you have to struggle with to get out of the pocket.The screen is nice and vibrant . Not the best out there but it is crisp and very responsive , with every indication of quality . Decent viewing angles . I find the 3.7 '' just small enough to still be easily usable and easy to type on , and still big enough for some gaming and video . Big screens are nice for those things , but I think they hit the sweet spot with 3.7 '' - big enough but not so big as to make the phone itself too big.The ICS operating system is very smooth , noticeably more refined ( and simpler , once you get used to it ) than previous versions . I do n't even care if this phone ever gets Jelly Bean or not , I am perfectly happy with ICS . App compatability has been very good so far - nearly every app I had loaded on the X ( and every single one I use regularly ) works fine on this one , which is surprising since this one is so new.Under the hood this one has similar specs to what my Droid X had : a 1Ghz Snapdragon processor and 512MB of RAM . Higher end phones nowadays are sporting dual and even quad core processors paired with 1GB of RAM , but really , what do you need that for ? Pretty much newer graphically intense gaming , which I do n't really do with my phone ( I have an Acer Iconia Tab A100 for that ) . I do light gaming on the phone , and for that this works just fine ( although even this one will play many of the higher end games like Shadowgun , it 's just not as smooth as the S3s of the world ) . As for other apps the hardware in the One V runs everything just fine with very little to no lag , so I 'm not missing those extra cores and extra RAM . Note that if you intend to do serious gaming on your phone then this one is not for you , but if you are just a casual phone gamer then this works just fine.The GPS is possibly the brightest spot on this phone - it is simply phenomenal . I toggle the GPS on , hop into GPS Status and *immediately* acquire 8 satellites - indoors . Then open maps and see that it has located me to within about 3-5 meters . I sometimes had to wait up to 5 minutes for my Droid X to get a position , this one took about 5 seconds.The camera is not bad at all . The Droid X had an 8MP camera , this one a 5MP camera , and I ca n't tell the difference in quality . It does , however , have a neat little function where you can hold down the shutter button for a few seconds and it takes multiple pics rapidly , and lets you pick the one you want to keep . This is VERY handy for capturing stills of moving targets . Also , there is little to no shutter lag , which also helps.Battery life has been pretty good so far . After about 10 hours at work doing some browsing , light gaming , some tunes , fiddling with GPS a bit , and no recharging I get home with anywhere from 20-40 % remaining . That is perfectly adequate for me.Cell reception seems to be quite good for me so far . I get decent 3G signal and download speed even when walking in an underground train tunnel and in areas where other big carrier phones do n't . I had expected worse from a no-contract carrier , but am pleasantly surprised . I understand this will vary greatly depending upon location , but where I live it is very good . Call quality has also been good on both ends.Wifi and Bluetooth work fine . I was even able to tether my tablet using FoxFi and run it off of Bluetooth ... To save my data plan I turn on Wifi whenever I have access ( like as soon as I get home ) . The 3G is for when I am out and about , and I should have no problem bumping up against VM 's throttle limit of 2.5GB of data . That would only really be a problem if one was streaming lots of video or music , which I do n't do.So , in conclusion , is this a top of the line phone ? No , if you want that then you will get a contract with a big carrier , and you will pay alot for it . For me , and I suspect for most users out there , this phone does what I need it to do , and it does it well . If the Galaxy S3 is top of the line , and say a Droid Razr is runner up , then this one would place third . But I am factoring the cost into my evaluation , and the cost for a One V from VM is *much* less than those types of phones , and you get a platform that does pretty much the same stuff for the vast majority of users out there . And the monthly bill is far easier to swallow . Even if you get the $ 55/month unlimited everything plan and add the $ 5 insurance ( worth it IMO ) it 's still far less than you will be paying on any smartphone contract . As an example , our 2 smartphone contract with the old carrier with 700 minutes cost us just under $ 200/month , while 3 smartphones with VM with 1800 minutes total cost us $ 120/month . More phones + more minutes + lower monthly cost = Win every day of the week.And one of the best things : you are not stuck with this phone . Phones become obsolete quickly , generally long before the 2 years is up on contract . About a year into the contract you 're sitting there fiddling with your phone looking at the cool new stuff everyone is playing with and thinking `` Oh great , I 'm stuck with this thing for another year ... '' . You have no easy ability to upgrade ; you either pay a huge penalty to do so or you are just stuck with what you have , which will certainly be obsolete after the first year . With these you can just toss the phone and upgrade easily any time you want , and the new phones are n't that expensive . That is probably my favorite feature of all.So if you are in the market for a decent no-contract phone and do n't need the bells and whistles of the Evo or want it 's size and bulk , this is a fantastic choice . The phone itself is not a 5 star phone , I 'd give it 3.5-4 stars in today 's environment - but realistically that is perfectly fine for 95 % of the users out there . Most people do not actually need the uber-cool hardware of the latest release , they just need something that works , and this one does . Factoring in the cost and the flexibility of going off-contract is what gets it to 5 stars . And if you are looking at the Optimus Elite I 'd recommend considering the One V ; it 's worth the extra $ 50 . The OE is a nice little phone and worth its price , but this one is better ; my wife is already bugging me to get her one ... Oh , and BTW - Otterbox already has a case out for these , and it is great . Amazon has them , too.UPDATE : So , been running this phone for a few weeks now , and I am still liking it alot . A few comments : Battery : most Android phones take a week or two to learn the user 's patterns and optimize themselves , and this one is no exception . During the first week or so I had some days where it almost died on me , but now it knows me and is sipping juice . It 's not abnormal for me to get home with close to 50 % battery left now , which is quite good , I think . The inability to remove the battery will not be an issue , as by the time this battery goes bad ( they all do eventually ) this phone will be obsolete and it will be time to replace it anyway . Tough it out through those first couple of weeks and you wo n't be disappointed in this battery.OS : ICS is running very smooth . I had a couple of FCs at first but as with the battery , it smoothed itself out and is running nearly to perfection now . App compatibility is still phenomenal for a relatively new phone.Cell signal : During the first week I had 3-4 instances where the phone lost 3G signal , but I do n't fault it much as I was deep within a heavy metal structure building and buried under lots of concrete . It has n't happened since , and when it did it found the signal again within a minute , so not exactly a big deal . I have since traveled across state ( TX , a big one ) and found cell reception / 3G to be quite good pretty much everywhere . I never noticed any areas where I could n't get a signal . Running on Sprint 's network I did n't expect any problems in this area , and have n't really found any ; they have a very well developed network and their expansion is ongoing . Also , as more people move onto 4G networks it makes 3G easier to ride.GPS : the GPS continues to impress me . It is n't always immediate as in my first review , but it is always fairly fast ( generally less than 20 seconds for multiple satellite lock ) . It is most definitely a real GPS , too , and not just some AGPS tomfoolery . It works fine in Airplane Mode and where there is no cell signal ... Just know that you will need preloaded maps or have one downloaded via Wifi for it to be of any use if you are going out of network ( there are several good apps to do this with , I personally like MapDroyd and Backcountry Navigator Pro , respectively , for their given applications ) .Camera : I am still liking the camera , too . When trying to snap photos of moving objects/people just hold the shutter button down until it 's passed and then select the pic you want to keep - very handy function . The quality is not great , but not bad either . Perfectly acceptable for a phone camera . The only issue I have with the camera is the zoom - not very good there . But fine for anything close up.The wife is bugging me every day now to get her one , do n't think I 'll be able to hold off much longer . Taken as a whole , this phone and the plan price tag is a fantastic value , and it does everything I need it to do . Still highly recommended.Oh , and Trident now has a nice looking case out for these . They are generally on par with Otterbox and offer another alternative . Mine will continue to wear the Otterbox for now , as I am happy with it.UPDATE 2 : After uninstalling a few apps , I am now coming home with 60 % battery or so . I NEVER came close to that with the X. I took off some widget apps and just run with the stock weather/clock widget ( which is actually pretty good ) , took off Sonic 4 Ep 1 and the Alarm Clock app , and voila ! One or more of those apps was running in the background ; the phone also does n't get hot anymore unless I am REALLY pushing it ... It is smooth as silk now.I ca n't say enough about this phone , or the fact that it only costs me $ 40 a month with insurance.UPDATE 3 : After a couple of months I finally broke down and got the wife one . Ordered a Trident case for it . Like I said in the earlier review , one of the great things about these no contract phones is you can upgrade anytime you want . So the wife upgrades from the Optimus Elite to the One V , and the kid gets to upgrade from an Optimus V to an Optimus Elite . Everyone wins.And mine is still running great . It 's probably the most problem-free smartphone I 've seen so far . Still highly recommend it.UPDATE 4 : Quick status update , it 's New Year 's , 2013 , and this phone is still going strong for both me and the wife . Still a great deal , especially at the prices it 's been selling at lately . I bought it for twice what it 's selling at now ... I 'd do it all over again at the original price . That is how happy I 've been with the phone.UPDATE 5 : All good things must come to an end . One of the great things about the VM line is that it 's easy to upgrade whenever you want to since you 're not on contract . I tried out an EVO V 4G for awhile , and it 's a decent phone , but I 've finally found the sweet spot with the Samsung Galaxy Victory 4G LTE . It is using Sprint 's 4G LTE and it 's simply a quantum leap forward . Price point is not bad at all either , and it 's on sale right now for less than I paid for my One V ... The One V was a great phone , it did everything I needed and functioned well . But the future lies in 4G LTE networks . Jump on VM 's next big ship and take a ride , you wo n't be disappointed .	1
Got this for the low price and current ICS system , without regard to if any decent roms are coded for it , seems most have gave up and moved on to other HTC devices , only one or two decent roms for primoc one v 's or you can try a gsm/cdma conversion , but so far not having luck with any decent roms besides jelly bean and I really like the sense ics system better for this phone as it is limited on the cpu resources and memory . also most shipped after early 2012 are hboot 1.53.00 and thus has no s-off option yet.. but can be unlocked and flashed with a custom recovery , kernel , etc..	1
This was brought for a teenager 15 years old . She wanted her own phone . Since she received good grades I thought this would be the perfect way to reward her . This phone is nice loaded with apps and easy to use . The music sounds excellent on here as a mp3 , or even when you hook it up to a portable speaker , I do not think its that sturdy one drop and its over for the phone . I am going to get a good cover to help protect it . Overall my daughter loved it and I like that it is a prepaid phone .	1
I just love this phone . My girlfriend had gotten an LG Optimus Elite for Virgin mobile last year and now wants one of these as she says it works more smoothly . The size is perfect and I actually really like the curved bottom ... it helps when you are in the car or somewhere dark and ca n't quite see , you can tell which end is the bottom . I have n't had one single issue with this . Plus you really really can not beat the price on Amazon , especially if you have prime.NOTE : If you want a good chuckle , read some of the 1 and 2 star reviews . Most are from people reviewing the wrong phone , and a couple are people who said they loved the phone but hated having to talk to customer service that sounded like they are from India ? So give the phone 1 star ? Yeah ... these people do n't know how to work reviews . I 've been a Virgin mobile customer for 4 years now and have nothing but 100 % positive experiences with the company . I 've save a ton of money as well . There should n't be any need to ever call into virgin mobile if you have access to the internet on a computer ... and what big company now days DOES N'T have their call center based in India or somewhere ? Anyway ... A++++ on this phone .	1
Picked up this phone for my bride to be ; it was on sale on VM 's site and looked pretty decent . She also wanted a smaller one than the one I have ( HTC EVO V ) . This model was n't available when I got mine , and honestly- despite the fact that it 's a lower end device- I like it more than the EVO.First off , this device is considerably lighter and more compact than the EVO , and I like the angled bottom . It makes it easier to hold , and despite its slender form it still has a solid feel.It has a 5 MP camera which is essentially the same as one of the two cameras on the EVO V. To be honest , I 've hardly used the 3D picture feature on my EVO so for all intents and purposes this is the same thing . The camera is also flush with the back , not jutting out.Performance is good , and while it has only 512 MB of RAM it 's really good enough for anything except maybe some 3D games . If you care about such things , then yeah- get an iPhone , EVO , or Galaxy . If not , this is really quite good enough . The device has most standard features : bluetooth , micro-SD slot , GPS , etc.The device runs Android 4.0 ICS and is generally very responsive . The screen is very bright and clear , and although it 's not exactly a retina display it 's fine for general tasks like browsing and email.The micro-SD slot is n't externally located , but it 's the next best thing . You pop off the bottom panel where the antenna is , and there it is . No need to power it off , pry off the whole back panel , and take out the battery . Internal memory has about 1 GB free.Oh , and on a sidenote , it is a 3G device- not 4G . However , I 've found that 4G coverage is so bad in my area that it really makes no difference . If 4G is a selling point for you , you should definitely check the service map before you decide on anything.In short , although it is n't the powerhouse that the EVO V is , I actually wish I 'd gotten this one instead . Aside from it being cheaper , it 's simply a much handier smartphone due to its size , weight , and shape.Pro : Is n't super-expensive.Decent performanceNice light , thin , angled-lip form factorVery nice screenGood camera and easily accessible SD slotCon : It is n't a handheld XBOX360 ...	1
The arrives as advertised and as expected . The weight is good , with multiple variants possible . It was a good price ( when we bought them ) , and good value . The screw-on ends seem to hold the weights well , and so far they have held up well - no rust , etc . Decent pair of dumbbells and worth the price we paid ( around two-hundred fifteen ) . The price does seem to vary , and currently is more expensive then we paid .	1
Anyone who can bitch about .67 a pound after shipping for steel has never lifted real weights and knows nothing . Back in the day they did not even paint them so a few flakes are like dumb to complain about . 30 years I have lifted almost the entire time and I have used all kinds of machines and free weights alike . Free Weight is what it is . Vaccum around your place every once in a while you pigs : ) enjoy my rating because I love them ... also yes I use standard lock jaw collars I bought with them because I seriously lift when I am lifting . warmups are a set of 50 reps with 30 pounds standard slow speed no one is in a hurry . It doesnt work that way .	1
The quality of the handles was great especially with the rubber seals . The weights were nice and overall quality product . I paid $ 235 total for this which is a pretty good deal if you live far from civilization . I fortunately found a place down the street that sells weight plates .70/lb which would be awesome if I had not already purchased this . I would of only had to pay about $ 160 so I will be going that route . So check around your area to see if you have any fitness wholesalers first . You must pay for return shipping with this item so make sure its what you want . I was able to return them myself because I live close to the sellers return address , but not everyone will be that lucky . The company was kind enough to return my money in full with no restocking fee .	1
Solid set , the threaded collars are machined well and the rubber collar & # 34 ; locks & # 34 ; are a great feature . As others noted , the weights are processed with some chemical that makes them smell very odd , but no worries , it could n't possibly be harmful ...	1
I bought these to have some dumbbells to add to my work out . I originally had a band work out machine on the door that said 100lbs of resistance . While the bands felt easy to do reps at . The weights were not easy . I do n't think my bands were a real 100lbs . I 'm currently doing exercises at 45lbs with the dumbbells , They hold together nicely and offer a great range of motion . I 've already increased the weight I lift at multiple times . The range of motion is also helping.Just holding the bar differently and doing the same range of motion works out extra muscle groups and I 'm liking the definition that my arms are starting to show.One thing to note these shipped USPS and in 5 boxes . I had to pick them up at the post office . The mail man just left a note at my door saying I was n't home .	1
They are ugly , but they get the job done For the money you really ca n't complain . Changing weights takes time with these type of setups , but If you do n't change weights often you 'll be fine . I plan use them for heavy chest workouts with my Bowflex SelectTech Adjustable Bench Series 5.1 .	1
Just recieved these today . Nice deep knurling on the handles and rubber washers to keep the nuts from spinning loose so the weights do n't fall off while lifting . Great for dumbell bench press or overhead press movements and they work fine for bicep curls , shrugs , triceps extensions or any other dumbell exercise you can think of . I still recommend tightening the nuts after each set or at least checking them for safety sake . Each dumbell can be adjusted from as little as 5 pounds to a full 100 pounds . A lot of potential weight combos and they do n't take up the room or cost as much as a rack of hex dumbells . It would take the average guy a long time to out grow these monsters and if you do just add a set of 25 pound plates to each and make them real beasts .	1
You 're looking for cheap , adjustable dumbbells because you do n't want to pay the extortionate costs of those special adjustable dumbbells from Powerblock and Boxflex . This is it . The weights and bar are sturdy , the crank comes off pretty easily.The biggest con is the black paint on the set , which WILL flake . Your workout room probably is n't the nicest room in your house , so just vacuum from time to time and you 'll pick up the sparkly little flakes that you 'll start finding . I kind of wonder why they even bother to paint it .	1
First off I did not buy this from Amazon . Just want to write this review to remind someone like me : At the first glance I thought it is really a good deal , $ 200 for 200LB with a pair of handle . But when I did some research I found you could get a more decent ( probably ) and more useful pair off Amazon.It seems that there are only two sets of weight from these sellers , 200LB and 110LB . For me , 200LB is way to much which probably I will never use , but 105LB just not enough as my bench dumbbell press is 50LBx2 and I am trying to put more weigh on . I think I can go 70LB 80LB or so finally but 100LB is out of my mind at least at this time.The tricky thing is the weight assignment of the weights : for the 105LB , it is 8x5LB and 2x2.5LB , which means if I want to upgrade , I will need to discard one pair of the 5LB weight and buy a new pair of 10LB one , because there is not any space for me to put more weight plates . So the options for me : either I buy the 200LB set and maybe put 40LB ( $ 40 ) away and never use it ; or I buy the 105LB set and need to spend more money to buy another 8x10LB , and put 8x5LB away and never use it.Several days before I did some research at local retail store , and just found that Walmart and Dick 's both has their weight plates on sell under $ 1 per 1LB , and the plate is painted and looks better than that sold here ( judging from the picture ) . Furthermore , both of them have a combo set , which include like 30 or 40LB weight and a pair of handle bar , for sale just about $ 10 more than the pure weight , eg , a pair of dumbbell with handle bar and 30LB weight is sold for $ 40 . Buy this combo , and then put whatever weights you really need , you are actually saving money . Like for me , I get 4x10 , 4x5 , and 2x2.5 , which gives me totally 65LB weight and 10LB handle , which is more practical for me , and I spend less money . Do your own calculation and see if this is really a good deal before you get down to buy it .	1
AS Multicam is the unoffical 'best ' camo out there now , this is an essential piece of gear for your loadout . From sweat wiking to breaking up your profile , this is a good piece of gear . Strong material and sweat wicking , drop your shemaugh and grab this !	1
I like the scarf and it arrived very quickly . It would be nice if it were a little longer but I think it will be fine as is . Nice color in the woodland pattern and I can see how this will have multiple uses .	1
works for me , not hot , itching or heavy , smooth , breathable and easy to manipulate , what a scarf , wished I used this in Iraq , when I needed it .	1
I really like this thing for the price , which I believe was around 10 bucks . It matches very well with my multicam armor plate carrier and the rest of my multicam tac gear . The opposite side is sort of a very light tan color , which works well for my Coyote colored gear . Its not very thick , and its more of a material that some athletic shorts are made of , so its not an issue with getting warm . Worth every penny in my humble opinion .	1
Ok I ordered the CAMO GREEN one NOT the Multi CAM . I layed mine out on the carpet did not stretch it but simply layed it out took a tape measure and it measured in 3 places 16.5 inches Wide NOT 18 inches Wide as described ; However , it also measured 64 inches long ! ! ! ! The described lenght is 60 inches . Anyway , it is a piece of cloth material but honestly I can not live without it just a really cool item . It is thin so in my opinion not much of a neck warmer but good to block off the airflow loss that does occur around ones neck but it is not thick material . You can see through it if you flop it over your head but your vision will be somewhat compromised but a cool item to instantly camo up and not be seen plus still have the ability to keep your head up and observe . Have not tried it as a towel I doubt this material is cotton so it would make a lousy towel in my opinion may make a good tourniquet or sling . But the thing is so lightweight I would just get yourself one and have it in your ensemble . I am glad Amazony sells this item . Would make a good gift it is an item for the person who has or needs to have everything of this type of item .	1
This is an excellent lightweight slicer . I use it as a neck knife and I do n't even know it 's there most of the time . Well-made , very sharp out of the box , comfy ( albeit somewhat toy-like ) handle and good Swedish steel ... For under $ 10 , one can not ask for more . If you want to strike a fire steel , grind down the spine flat a little ( it 's fairly easy with a file or Dremel if you do n't have a grinder ) and you 're good to go . Lots of mods on Youtube .	1
Knife is as advertised and Im happy with my purchase . Its sharp and appears to be well made . I would buy another one .	1
The obvious advantage is that a fixed blade will not fold over , as it slips under pressure . The guard on the bottom of the handle keeps your fingers from sliding up onto the blade . All this adds up no missing fingers.Carbon steel blade is razor sharp . Easy enough to maintain with aShun DM0750 Honing SteelandJapanese Sword Choji Oil.This is the perfect knife for a child . At what age ? You know your own kid better than anyone else , so it 's not a matter of age . I was about 6 when I got my first knife . I was taught safe handling , different grips , and how to maintain the blade , handle , and sheath properly . I used that knife for everything from cutting sandwiches , to cutting fruit , and even at the dinner table for steaks . Ever notice how you 're always having to open snack food packaging like chips and beef jerky ? With his or her own knife , the kids can do it on their own . Kids feel good when they can do things , or help an adult do things . With this little knife , they can learn responsibility and build self esteem . Your little one could be your sous chef . He or she could cut and trim the veggies for dinner , make mirepoix , and assemble your mise en place . And of course , let 's not forget the obvious , that this is a camp knife . You child , with his or her own little camp knife , could help with all the chores like setting up camp , field dressing and processing game , cleaning fish , and making the fire . This little knife could open up a whole world of learning for your child . Open your mind . You could learn right alongside your child , as you 're teaching.The standard test is slicing paper . This blade cuts paper , and a whole lot more . As a utility knife , you will look for these around the house , garage , and shop for a multitude of task . Paring fruits and vegetables . Cutting meat . Opening paint cans . Opening packages . Opening mail . Cutting rope . Cutting bait . Stripping wire . Bar fight . Pry open shipping crates . Cutting zip ties . Pry open a stuck window . Whittling . Collecting debts . Although there are specific tools to do all those tasks with , the idea to this utility knife is that you can also reach for this.Too many survival reality shows on television have romanticized the knife as a survival tool . Who would deliberately be under-equipped , then purposely get stuck in the woods , so that you would have to use your knife to chop wood and dig holes ? The only reason those guys on TV are in that situation , is because they put themselves there . You can stay in the comfort of your living room . If you plan a trip to the woods , BE PREPARED . Ever notice how none of those guys has a gun ? I would n't go into the woods without a gun . That is why you see these guys trying to build snare traps like a 12 year old trying to earn a merit badge . Bring a gun . Bring matches . Bring a lighter . Bring water . Bring food . Bring a sleeping bag . What the hell are you doing , going to the forest , without a way to get out ? If you look online , and watch home made videos , the big concern is what is known as batoning wood . What that is , is holding your knife blade up to tree or piece of wood , then striking the spine of the knife with another piece of wood . The action is reminiscent of swinging a baton . You are using your knife to do what you should be doing with an ax . I still do n't understand it . Why do n't you just use an ax ? Can anybody really offer an explanation for not owning an ax on your farm , and not bringing a camp ax to camp ? But if you do decide that you have to , this knife will hold up to batoning if you 're splitting small pieces of wood or cutting small trees and branches . You are not taking down a 200 year old redwood with this little knife . Little knife ; little tree.Plane crash ? If you 're lucky enough to survive , how did you sneak the knife past TSA ? Got lost hiking ? A compass , maps , & GPS would be more important than having this knife . A little planning before you go camping , hiking , or hunting , and you will have all the tools you need , including a camp ax and shovel.If you 're any kind of soldier , you would have more than this knife . Today 's soldiers are no longer in `` battle fields '' . Modern warfare is more often in an urban environment . Maybe you can open the enemy 's mail.This is a great little knife that you will find yourself reaching for . You will go from owning one , to buying several . You will want to keep one in the shop , one in the garage , one in your office , one in your kitchen , and maybe even have one in your car.One of my best friends , whom I also work with , is a bit effeminate . Actually , more than just a bit . He is proud of his orientation . So much that he goes to the Pride parade in June every year . He does n't own any knives other than the ones in the kitchen , but is always borrowing one of mine . I finally bought him one of these . He loves it . I love that he wo n't have to borrow mine . Now he keeps it in hisBrown Bag Company 31559 Alpine Mailbag ( man purse ) , and is warming to the idea of actually carrying it on his belt , or on a length ofParacord Planet Nylon 550lb Type III 7 Strand Paracord Made in the U.S.A.as a neck knife .	1
Sharp , sharp , sharp . Great price , ordered a few for my hunting buddies . Cheap appearence , but utilitarian , which I like . I use it for skinning deer , etc .	1
I was looking for a simple , inexpensive knife to use for working on walking sticks . I found this and decided to try it , and I ca n't believe I got this knife for so cheap . It 's sharp out of the package , and holds an edge well . The handle does get a little uncomfortable after continuous use , but not enough to really complain about . The case is n't something I would throw on my belt , but it is great for just storing the knife in around the house when not in use . Over all , a great knife at an unbelievable price . This would be a great first knife for anyone learning how to use and care for it . The price is low enough that it would n't hurt if you messed up the blade while sharpening it . Very happy with this purchase .	1
very comfortable fit and kept me dry all day though 8+ hours . i use it for costumes and it worked perfectly	1
I 'm a firm believer in Under Armour . I use it in the summer and winter . It works and keeps me cool . I love under armour .	1
This is my second one of these UA heat gears and I really do like them . It does seem to absorb the sweat very well and keeps it off my sweaters . The only thing I would have liked to change would be that they could be just a tad bit longer past the waist . Its good but would be best if just a little longer .	1
This thing is worthless , as soon as you hit even the smallest bump it shuts off . I 've tried tightening everything , using different batteries , etc , nothing helps.If the light actually worked it 'd be a great buy as it 's extremely bright , and the telescoping action is a very nice feature.Do n't trust your life or your safety on this piece of junk , spend the extra $ 10 and get something a little nicer that 's actually going to work and keep you alive .	-1
First of all , two day shipping should NOT take three days . It should n't take a whole day to 'prepare ' the product for shipping . I ordered it Wednesday morning and it should arrive on Friday and be ready for the group night ride we had planned for Saturday . No , it was finally shipped on Thursday and did not arrive until Monday . Serious disappointment . Then when I got it , I find it 's just a flashlight in a jig that connects to the handlebars , not a genuine headlight . It 's fairly bright , but the AAA batteries did n't last very long on the bright setting . It 's going back .	-1
0 Star , or better yet , minus 100 stars . I had to click on 1 star , because Amazon wo n't let me enter my comments.If I am not educated , I would certainly swearing in profanity . This `` Headlight '' can not possibly be brighter than 0.24 Lumen , let alone the claim is 240 Lumens . I got sucked in and bought 3 of them . Junks , do n't waste your money , and stop looking at it . I have never bought anything so useless.Oct 23 , 2012 updateTo be sure that I give the product a fair review , I replaced the batteries with brand new ones , and tried all three lights , they are all at about the same level of brightness . Not bright enough for biking purpose , in my opinion.I bought these lighte bsaed on all the reviews before me , `` too bright , ... '' I wonder what are they comparing to.I have bought single AAA pocket LED ( 60 Lumens ) lights brighter than this item . My comment remain the same after trying all 3 that I bought . They are only bright enough for inside a tent use , when dimmer lights are preferred.Product description need to truly reflect the product itself , exageration of the product performance is just fraud .	-1
I was hopeful with all the good reviews that this would be a worthwhile purchase . Wrong . This light feels cheap . Typical Chinese quality or lack there of . I have a 200 lumen light purchased at Costco as part of a three-pack . The Costco light is much brighter and more focused . I will give this a try on my mountain bike as soon as possible . Hopefully the mount stays intact .	-1
I bought this light thinking & # 34 ; How bad can it be for less than $ 10 ? & # 34 ; It was bad enough that I took the time to return it . The construction was shotty , the tail cap threads only caught for about half a turn , the lens was not clear , aluminum foil would have made a better reflector material , the AAA battery carriage would probably break if you looked at it the wrong way and to top it off this light could not be over 40 lumens.Spend your money on a decent bike light .	-1
Title says it all . This is just one of those cheap dollar store LED flashlights that comes with a cheap plastic holder to mount it to your bars . Its hard to get it to clamp tight enough ( because its plastic ) , so when you try to press the button on the back of the flashlight ( to turn it on ) it wants to pop out of the holder . Does n't provide all that much light . Spend more money for a real bike light - you will probably regret buying this one - I did .	-1
takes a month to get to the U.S.A cheaply made and as it 's maker not to bright in the lumens dept maybe 90 lumen ( and the buyer , me ) return cost more than the flash light .	-1
For under $ 10 , I did n't expect much - but I did expect it to last more than one ride . Worked great out of the box , but already dead , and I 've owned it for about 4 days . Pass on this .	-1

This item looks great on the weapon ( ruger mark ll ) , but thats it , at first itried shooting and none of my rounds would land on the target , therefore making it really diffivult for me to adjust the sight . Then turning the screw for the dot to go up made it go down ... No need to say further	-1
No way to adjust the reticle brightness , is ok in low light but in sunlight it is so bright that it washes out the target and leaves ghost images on your retina , , not good for outdoors during the day , might be ok for home defense , but with no on-off switch your battery might be dead when you hear something go bump in the night.. I would skip it .	-1
I bought this for my AR to mount on top of my scope for CQ reasons . It would not adjust to even get close for a 50 yd shot . I took the chance and failed . Now off to spend $ $ $ for the right one . Darn .	-1
While I really enjoyed this product for 6 months , it stopped working . This is my second finis mp3 player . The company has the worst customer service . I called them at least 5 times leaving messages with very little response . Response to them by email never went through . After 3 weeks of trying , I gave up and went with my warranty that I payed for . They were great and approved my claim without problem . I will never buy anything from finis again . Seems they give the run around to avoid having to refund or replace . I never give a bad report and this is the first .	-1
Do not buy this . I 'd rather drag my kayak across the beach without these than use them ... what a waste of money..	-1
I have n't gotten this to work for more than 10 yards . the clip on the strap broke on hour 1. yes the tires stink , but I put car wash on them and that fixed it .	-1
Okay , so I deleted my last review because I thought this might be an okay product but it clearly has problems.I installed this thing in my Saiga 12 and Romanian wasr-10 and it effects reliability substantially . The difference in recoil is pretty much negligible anyway , so I would avoid this product entirely . It sounds like a cool idea but it has its flaws . Perhaps the bolt ca n't move back far enough to get clearance for ejection and feeding purposes .	-1
I bought 1 , and it cracked in half , so bought another broke the same exact way , save ur money it 's a P.O.S .	-1
I just recieved this part and opened the package . The buffer seems cracked and there was a hole in the center . Now , I am not an expert , but this to me looks defective . Called the 800 # included with the packaging asking you to call them first if you have a problem . Service was unhelpful at the least and just told me to use the return process from Amazon . The person I talked to merely acted like I had no idea what I was talking about since I was not an expert . Basically , the part looked broken , and the company did not want to help me . Sent back for a refund .	-1
Wobbles alot . There 's no way to mount this to be stable with the included mounting clips/straps . You 'll definately need to sew this in .	-1
It never got to me . Said it did . But no hanger . So I ca n't say pleased on something I did n't get .	-1
I only gave this monocular two stars because it looks and feels like it should be effective . However , upon first use , I found that it would barely focus without coming out of focus instantly . It was hard to find the sweet spot where everything looked clear in spite of the 49mm focal length . I am returning it and searching for a better product . Do not waste your money on this one .	-1
None of the other reviewers mentioned this but on the scope I got the lens was a fish eye . Only the very center of the lens would be in focus with the remainder getting worse to the outside edge . The lens were in tight so I do n't know if it was just an odd ball or if no one else is mentioning it . Because of the very limited clear view , anything at distance was tough.It is also supposed to be a 16X40 . I have a 10X40 binocular that seems to zoom in almost as close . Maybe with the full lens working it may appear better or maybe something was knocked out of place during shipping . It 's hard to imagine this is a 16X.I will say I liked the size , it fits well in the hand . I liked the texture and grip of the case . It has to be tough , they ship it in a padded envelope and it survives.For $ 10 I would have kept it if only it was the fish eye . It would be great for general spotting if the lens was correct .	-1
Poor quality and would not last long . 16x is good but not the one I got . I do not recommend , would not buy again , and I hope this helps someone .	-1
The monocular is very average and does not here anything special . The magnifications is not that good , so I would say , if you want form good monocular , get something else .	-1
I estimate actual magnification to be about 7x . I compared to my 8x REI monocular and 9x Nikon rifle scope and the image is smaller than both . Also , image is just as bright and clear in my REI even thought it 's only 20mm . Seller was Goldjoy .	-1
Purchased to use at the range at 50 yards but had to switch back to binoculars because the image was so shaky i could n't see squat .	-1
If what you want to focus on is less than 10 meters than this will work for you . Otherwise , it is incapable of focusing on anything of real distance , which is precisely why one might want a monocular . It is compact but so is a small rock in your hand .	-1
Using it or not using it is almost the same . It enlarges very little and with not much clarity it does make very little difference . Wanted to use for 20yd indoor bow shooting , ca n't see arrows much better than without . Improves some 15 % only	-1
I wish I would have received the product to try . I ordered it and never received it and had to do an A-Z claim with Amazon . they gave me a 43.00 dollar credit and spent it with someone else since this company would not replace the missing order.. glock sells a nice upgraded recoil spring with an internal metal sleeve eliminating the problems with the old plastic design and its only like 17.00 dollars.. a much better deal than this .. and they shipped fast	-1
This thing SUCKS ! I put this in my G30s and in less than 100 rounds it bent at the base . I will never buy one again .	-1
Yes , these are very inexpensive ... which is why they were purchased . Screwlock carabiners typically have a stop that precludes the screw ring from going too far . These do not . The screw ring will screw right off the gate and jiggle loosely on the end of the gate beyond the threads and on the end of the carabiner . In this position , the gate still will not open ( which is why I rated this higher than 1 star ) , but since the screw bezel will not tighten down , it is not secure and can work back down the threads on the gate and allow the gate to open . In other words , being locked is tenuous and can not be considered reliable.Otherwise , these still function as carabiners just fine and if you do n't expect much more from them other than that , then the tenuous lock is a bonus .	-1
Most of the time you can say the stitching was insufficient or just poorly done . There is a section on this pack where it looks like it was never even stitched.It 's being returned for a refund before I even used it . Very pathetic .	-1
These lids do not work on all Klean Kanteen bottles . They seem to work on the shorter ones , but always leak with the 27 ozers . I should not have purchased these .	-1
The build quality and look this stainless steel Is amazing . However , it will make the most noise you 've ever heard in your life . The decibel level this stainless steel Been screwed on to the canteen is no less than a shuttle taking off into space . Unless you were simply going just for looks , I would strongly suggest that you stick with the original plastic due too it 's almost inaudible screw on noise level .	-1
I was very excited to get this bolt puller because of all the good things i had heard about it . However it does not in any way shape or form live up to expectations . It will NOT pull any arrow out of a high density target . it simply slips up the arrow as if it were greased and ruins the feathers .	-1
. I ca n't show you my detailed photographs ; because , I bought this through another site ; but what a bunch of slop welding this has .. this design could easily support 400 lb , if only it had real welding .. also , if you did reinforce it yourself , you might find the hitch was a problem : if you do n't have a quick release on your rear tire , it seems as if the bobbing weight wouldwiggle your axle bolt loose .. a ball & cup hitch is the way to go ; there is a bike trailer with such a hitch : the Cyclone Trailer by Radical Designs .. you can buy that hitch system separately too ; ( it 's not on amazon right now ... ) .. I 'm not sorry eno ' to return this trailer ; but I 'll need to do a lot more work to itthan I originally thought it would need .. holds up to 110 lb , but do n't go over 10mph ? 2 stars because they are n't kidding .. but if you really need it only for 25lb groceries , think of it as a 4-star item .	-1
All holes where pins go needed to be redrilled since nothing lined up . Both innertubes came with valves not even attached to the tubes so neiter tire could hold air . I 'm not quite sure what shape the rims are but they are n't round so the thing is going to bounce all over the place like a Harlem Globetrotter 's basketball . rim liners were as thin as saran wrap so they needed to be replaced . In one rim the liner was twisted and offering no protection to innertube . Overall , This thing was not even close to useful out of the box without some serious cobbling and it still is n't very good . Floor of the cargo area is cheap plastic which I give about a year and it will be shattered . Only real plus is the trailer rides fairly high off the ground compared to my old trailer.China has hit an all new low in their manufacturing sending out a pre-broken item . It used to be that things would last a few weeks after you took them out of the box . Mow they come broken and in need of repair/rework . `` Goor enough '' work ethics out of china is n't even close to `` good enough '' when the customer needs to fix the product before it can even be used.Update : Having no end of problems with the trailer . Going to post office it flipped and I had to drag it and the contents across a busy street which scratched it all up . On the way back one of the wheels flew off the trailer into traffic where it was hit by a car destroying my rim . I had to drag the trailer 2 blocks on one tire adding more lost paint to the growing collection of scrapes on the trailer from flipping the trailer and things falling off the trailer into the street . Trailer looks very used now due to the thing falling apart as I try and use it . Definitely a new low in Chinese manufacturing .	-1
This is just my opinion . Not easy to install , and can tell it 's cheaply made . I ended buying one from my local bike shop for about $ 20 more , had them install it and it 's a much better product . This is one of the only purchases made on Amazon where I would love to get my money back .	-1
This struck me as funny . The holster is advertised for the S & W Governor , but is packing the Taurus Judge ... ..I guess that 's good to know for Judge owners .	-1
The zipper pull was open on the opposite side because it did not match up properly . I zipped it up and it started opening from the closed end . The product looked nice felt it was made of quality material . But the zipper thing just blew me away . Oh , no tie downs in it and no shoulder strap to boot . Very dissatisfied . Amazon credited me though , give kudos for excellent customer service .	-1
DOES NOT COME WITH SHOULDER STRAP ! ! ! ! ! ! ! OR HAVE THE TIE DOWN STRAPS ON THE INSIDE JUST A FLIMSY CHEAP CASE ... NOT EVEN WORTH 10 BUCKS IN MY OPINION .	-1
***Update on 10/31/13***This bottle professes to be dishwasher safe . It says so right on the bottom of the bottle ( on the gray rubber base ) . However , in addition to the issue I identified in my 8/17/13 review update below , my bottle has now started to leak . The rubber O-ring inside of the lid appears intact , but somehow a very small amount of liquid gets out and trickles down the side of the bottle when I drink from it . This is a huge disappointment , given that I loved this bottle in the beginning . I am not sure what about the design is making it leak ( I 'm not an engineer or product designer ) , but this is not going to work for me . At this point , I think the bottle would only be useful for drinking clear water , which is not my preference . Drinking anything with color would put your clean shirt in jeopardy while drinking . Bummer . This product was almost great . My Aquasana glass bottles6-pack of Aquasana 18 Oz . Glass Bottles , on the other hand , have performed perfectly for me every single day for years now . They are a great value at the Amazon price , too . ***Update on 8/17/13***In their efforts to make this bottle idiot proof , the manufacturer put a blue ring at the top of the glass bottle that is exposed when the lid is turned just enough to let liquid pass through , but not so far that the lid will come off and the contents of the bottle will spill on your shirt . Personally , I think the manufacturer should have accepted that idiots will be idiots . People who spill beverages on themselves have more problems than can be solved with a blue ring at the top of a glass bottle . The problem with this blue ring is that it was adhered to the bottle with something that does not hold up well in the dishwasher . My blue ring is coming off and is rather unsightly at the moment . If I were a very picky consumer , I would return the bottle or stop using it . Instead , I will continue to use it and fully expect the blue ring to last just a few more washings in the dishwasher . It 's really too bad that they felt the need to add this unnecessary feature . If I am ever so stupid that I spill beverages on myself , I hope an asteroid hits my home while I 'm sleeping . ***Original Review Below***You might call me a water bottle enthusiast . Five days per week , I tote a glass Aquasana bottle6-pack of Aquasana 18 Oz . Glass Bottlesto work with me . I work for a company that actually sells water bottles , which makes me a real renegade , as I do n't use the ones that we sell . Why ? Because I swear by glass bottles . Even BPA-free plastic is not my thing . Drinking out of glass is just a whole different experience , and I have peace of mind knowing that there is nothing leaching out of my bottle and into my drink.When I was offered a opportunity to try this bottle as an Amazon Vine member , I was attracted first by the appearance of the bottle . While I like my Aquasana bottles , which look a lot like a Voss bottleVoss Artesian Water , 11.1600-ounces ( Pack of12 ) , my bottles do n't have a silicone , non-slip base , a contoured gripping dimple in the glass , or a cap that makes quite the statement of this Full Circle bottle . I must admit , as well , that I love Lime Green . Hence , this was my opportunity to take it up a notch , both in style and performance , and have something to compare to my everyday Aquasana bottles.The first thing I discovered upon inspection of the bottle when it arrived is that it had some kind of unique open/close feature that allows you to drink out of it without removing the cap . Very impressive ! That definitely knocks the socks off my Aquasana bottle tops . I had to try it about 10 times without water in it just to believe how cool it was . It worked perfectly , and it was very intuitive.The next thing I discovered about the bottle is that the opening to the glass bottle is HUGE when the top is removed . I love my Aquasana bottles , as they have a large opening on top , as well , which allows me to wash them inverted in the dishwasher without having to worry about whether they will get clean inside . However , the Full Circle bottle has even a LARGER opening , which makes it easier to put ice into the bottle than my Aquasana ( which requires me to sometimes pound cubes down into the bottle through the neck ) . As I expected , the Full Circle bottle washed perfectly in the dishwasher . I did hand wash the top , though I am sure it is dishwasher safe , too.Next came the test drive . I filled the bottle with ice , then water , then Crystal Light drink mix . I screwed on the cap , shook it up , and then twisted open the unique top that allowed me to drink without taking off the cap . It performed flawlessly . I love the gripping dimple in the glass , which makes it less likely that you 'll drop the sweaty bottle as condensation forms on the outside . The bottle has a solid , heavy-weight , substantial feel to it . The lid , even with its fancy open/close mechanism , is built to last.If I could afford it , I would recycle my Aquasana Bottles and replace them with a bunch of these . They are amazing . However , due to their much higher price , I will probably just stick to this one for now . If you are looking for a well-engineered glass water bottle with some unique features and style to boot , this one is a winner .	-1
I bought this at a local shop that was gong out of business . It is ok as far as water bottles , much better than plastic . It is easy to fill and drink from . It is nearly impossible o fully clean the cap because it is one solid piece with a silicon seal deep inside . There is no way to remove the seal to clean it . I worry about mold build up . The other thing is once filled fully and sealed , the cap must be unscrewed all the way , screwed back on and then opened to drinking position . It is kind of a pain . The last problem I have with this , it sticks in my car 's drink holder due to the base.Update : even with regular washing and drying , the top was full of mold . I guess that 's why the water tasted funny and I ingested occasional chunks of slime . There is no way to take a lid a part to wash it and dry it 100 % clean . Until they design a new top , I am never using this bottle again .	-1
This did not fit in my Type 56 SKS . i had to file down edges and shave a decent amount off . Once it was mounted my bolt slide was catching when i noticed a little bit of a bump from what looked like a ember from welding . I had to file it down and my bolt slide would still rub pretty hard against it . After getting it to fit i noticed the flat head screws holding the rail in place were very cheap , and loose . While tightening one the head of the screw just started tearing up and the nut was not even tight . After all that a few fires fro mthe gun re loosen the nuts making my scope no longer accurate . Would not recommend buying unless you have time to work with it a lot .	-1
I read all the positive and negative posts on this product before I purchased it . I had very high hopes for this as it is exactly what I have been looking for . The part was too long for my Yugo M59/66A1 SKS and needed to be filed down to fit . As expected , after filing , the part fit very tightly . The bore for the receiver pin was slightly off and had to be filed . The integrated rail screws are the real issue . They fit very loosely into the mount and rail had a slight wobble- even after it was fully tightened . This wobble is greatly accentuated with the scope installed . I had to use Loctite to keep the rail screws from backing out and to help the wobble . I am hoping not to have some of the bolt issues that I have read about . I have not fired it yet so this rating could be better or worse depending on if it holds zero or not and if it causes misfires .	-1
this product didnt fit . I figured filing would be in order but good lord i filed for hours and finally got the fit but then i couldnt rack back the receiver .	-1
I put new batteries in the unit and tested inside the house . All seemed to be working so I moved it outside to my front yard and pressed the baby crow distress call . I had hordes of crows circling low , landing in trees and making lots of noise within a couple of minutes . I would let some fly by then press the call and they would do an immediate about face . I was really excited and thought this thing is going to be awesome . 30 minutes later I turned it on to demonstrate it for a friend and it would not make a sound . I took out the batteries from the unit and the remote then re-installed them , tried the reset according to the instruction sheet but nothing helped . All the lights come on but it remains silent . I am sending this back for a refund . It may be a great call if you can make it work but the one I got was a huge disappointment .	-1
The sound is n't very clean . It sounds like listening to an old cell phone . It 's loud and the remote has good range . I 've called in a few Coyotes and a Fox but only the young ones that are n't as wise yet . Other calls I 've used have a better success rate , This is an okay beginner call but the animals do n't buy it very often . The remote batteries die quickly and are an odd and expensive size . The batteries in the call are AA and have lasted for a very long time . I 've tried it in AZ , UT and NM . It 's really not going to be your best bet but it 's better than nothing . A lot of the calls do n't really do much for you and are n't too useful . The Female Coyote Howl , Pup in distress and Cottontail Distress are the only 3 that seem kind of real . The rest sound like a guy in his backyard screaming . If it had a way to add custom sounds and/or came with better recording quality on it 's sounds it might be worth it .	-1
So far I am not happy with fit on the gun , it is not what I had hoped for but , to be fair I have n't spent even time to see why it does work like it should , the way the mount is made it is to far out of adjustment for me .	-1
This mount is not that great . Although the Mosin is an extremely old rifle and the company did their best to come up with a platform to offer people the opportunity to go with a scout-scope configuration , due to the straight-out bolt handle on the Mosin , this mount did not work that great for me . I mounted a long eye relief scope on the mount and could not zero the scope in at all . My friend pointed out to me as he watched me shoot that the mount had become loose , I looked at it and it did indeed have some play in the mount , even though it was as tight as I could possibly make it . I recommend either just using the iron sights , investing in a bent bolt , or doing things the gunsmithing way and remove the iron sight and mounting it directly to the barrel.I currently use iron sights on my Mosin now .	-1
If NcStar made these they would be sold for $ 20 ! And it 's the same chinese crap ! Sure , if I could get all of the pins out of my rifle i 'm sure it would hold my scope tight but it still would only be worth $ 20 .	-1
Used for an hour and one stopped working due to moisture ( sweat/humidity ) getting into the battery compartment - assumedly frying the circuit , and still visible in the reflector face . While I could try to dry out after runs with rice , etc , I really should n't have to for an outdoor specific device . Not sure if I got a bad one , but I do n't want to rely on something that appears to have a design defect of allowing moisture to enter , due to the lack any moisture isolation at the contact point ( sweaty hands ) , or prevents the environmental conditions entering ( humidity - dew point 75F on that run ) . I 'll go back to cheaper headlamps I use for work , strapped to hands.Update - the manufacturer was very understanding and refunded - please to have a good exchange with them . I would buy again IF this failure mechanism were addressed .	-1
Broke , after just a few uses . I would n't buy this ... keep looking . It 's basically a disposable light.I need to write 4 more words ... .	-1
I received the item and was impressed with the build quality . I read all the instructions and charged the unit per the instructions . The light was very bright and the stun gun was impressive . I left it alone for about 3 days then went to show a friend and it did n't work . No light , not stun , nothing . I felt it was odd for it ti lose it 's charge that fast , but I charged it again and now nothing , no light no stun . Needless to say I 'm quite disappointed that this expensive item is a piece of crap . I really wanted it to work but , hopefully the seller will refund me .	-1
that is all outdated ... and not effective enoughhave to be MOST POWER STOPPING at all cost , non lethal self-defense WEAPON , not a fancy toy1 million volts for stun gun - it is like NOTHING , we can easy find on the market 4-5 million volts stun guns , and 160 lumen 's flashlight - it 's a JOKE ! when we can find 8000 lumen 's fl ...	-1
After a while the clip wears out and once I tried to draw my gun the whole holster came out I would not buy it was good for the first few weeks but after constant wear and taking out holster and putting back the tension of clip has loosen do not buy please done make mistake	-1
No continuous on switch . You must press and hold the on switch to make it work . When you release the switch it does not stay on.Too bad it did n't state that little fact on the web page .	-1
This is a piece of junk . Did n't work when it arrived . Confirmed it was n't just a dead battery . Kind of a shame , because even though it was larger and bulkier than others in it 's range , it had a decent feel . I think the barrel mount might have worked out well if I was n't returning it .	-1
The body construction is preety good , but the whole sighting system is flimsy . The only thing holding the knobs from freely rotating in any direction they like is a little pin protruding on one side of the adjusting knobs touching the internally serrated housing surrounding them . The clicking you hear when you turn the adjusting knobs is nothing but the protruding pin jumping from serration to serration . The whole fixture is not strong enough to hold the adjusting knobs from rotating when you shoot a larger caliber rifle like a 270 and up . They need a locking ring or something . I have n't tried this laser sight on a 22 LR rifle but I 'm not interested on doing it.The other thing is that the red spot is not a circle , it is a line of about 3/16 inches long by 1/16 inches wide measured at only one inch apart from the laser pointer and the intensity of the red dot this thing produces is about the same as the one you can get with cheap laser pointers you can buy at any dollar store.Finally , the pressure switch is OK but the toggle swith is not such , it is just a cap that will turn on the laser when fully threaded in.The only reason I gave this review a 2 star evaluation is because the outside body of the sighter is preety good . I feel sorry for the design of the adjusting knobs is not good enough to withstand the recoil of bigger caliber rifles and the red dot intensity is not stronger.I am looking for a laser sighter that I can adjust to coincide with the center of the lines in my rifle scope and stay there when shooting my 30-06 Remington 700 . This is not it , I 'll return it and ask for a refund .	-1
Laser part of package seems ok , but I wanted an end push button switch option and this one does not come with that ! What you get is an end cap that turns the laser on , once you screw it all the way down tight . Then stays on till you unscrew the end cap . That may work for some people , but not me . Found the one I wanted on Ebay for a litter cheaper .	-1
made more for a bike than a car , sometimes they work and sometimes they dont cant see them going high speeds too	-1
the batteries died quickly , and the centrifugal switch only worked occasionally . I was very unhappy with these , and would recommend against purchase . There are other products that are much more reliable on the market .	-1
Truly a sub-optimal part . The screw can no longer tighten after I used it twice on a .223 AR15 . Thought I could get lucky on a $ 8 piece but I was wrong .	-1
This is not a workout short . It 's granny panty . See through . I would n't buy again or recommend for work out .	-1
Whoa , like my last girlfriend : good looking , really comfortable , but I ca n't last more than 30 minutes . This seat is HARD . It 's a great shape , looks good on my 10 speed , but I bike 8 miles to work , and I am happy to jump off when I arrive . I 've had worse , but it 's not suitable for any ride over 1 mile .	-1
This seat hurt my rear end , and unless you 're a 63 lb hipster , it 'll hurt yours too . In true hipster fashion , it looks great , but there 's not much to it otherwise !	-1
Really I bought these just because I wanted to see . I can not say anything more than I laugh too hard actually trying to achieve any exercise with this ridiculous gadget . It was invented by a man ... NO DOUBT ! But go ahead , you will definitely get you `` man handling '' training ! ... LMAO ...	-1
Tools look like cast iron . Do n't get it wet or it will vanish with rust . I have n't tested the patch and glue if it will work .	-1
The entire tool becomes extremely loose upon arrival and also immediately after every time you use it . Its huge , clunky , VERY heavy , and you always need another tool to tighten the bolts on this tool . It was inexpensive but I will never use it so any money spent on it was a total waste . Way too heavy to bring on a bike with you .	-1
I tried to get this to work right but i ended up just pulling it off . Planning on putting the money down on a non-chinese mount.I think i 've given this product a fair shot at staying together but it 's just failed . After tightening , and re-tightening ( at least 2x if not 3x ) it then sprung another problem.I do n't have it in front of me so hopefully i have this right ... There 's 2 small screws that fasten a plate that holds the lever in when tightened . After already struggling with the other tightening issues , this came up . I 'm sure i could loctite those little screws in but i 'm already at my end .	-1
04/12/2013Lost sleep in excitement for the bike ( light blue ) to arrive . Sprinted to the door when UPS man came by ! Right off the bat noticed that the box had a tear on it . I was a little disappointed with the lack of directions as well . Searched on youtube for a while to find a decent video tutorial . I noticed that in 3 different videos the box had a tear in the same exact location as mine . There were also some black plastic parts that were cracked/broken . I assumed that those black plastic parts were suppose be on different parts of the bike to make sure it was n't damaged ? Putting the bike together was frustrating even with `` 90 % '' already completed . I wasted hours trying figure it out ... Luck would have it that the end of the front bars that hold the tires were bent . Probably happened at transit since you 're not suppose to lay the box flat , I 'd imagine . I tried everything to make the tires fit into the bars , and eventually gave up . The handlebars also had some scratch marks on them . This is the first time something I ordered from Amazon was damaged so I am a bit skeptical on how returning works..I loved the light blue frame with the red and yellow tires , it was also super light ! So bummed that product was damaged . I can only hope that the next one wo n't have any problems.04/16/2013Once again I waited hours in the living room by the door for the UPS man . He arrived around 6:30pm..so I still had some daylight left ! Like a vision from the past I swiftly opened the door with open arms ! I gave him my old box with the first bike inside and as I went to grab the new one ... I quickly noticed that the same exact tear from before was there . I let it go since at least those `` black plastic parts '' were n't cracked this time around.I took out the bike and quickly began working on it with my girlfriend , whom might I add could not get over how beautiful the bike was . The first thing I did was put the front tire on . Absolutely no problem . Then the handlebar . BOOM ! Done ! Now to finish it off , the saddle ! AAaaaaaaaannd ... no ! The saddle rod would n't go in..I put some pressure onto it and it was JAMMED ! I swear..I ca n't catch a break . I could no longer adjust the seat . I again wasted hours trying to figure out and took it to a bike shop . One of them tried to pull it and right away told me they did n't want to damage the bike ? What ? I told myself , one last try.. I used their tools to open the seat to take a closer look but it seemed impossible to pull the rod out . I did manage to cut myself though.Daylight was gone and I was extremely frustrated . Plans with my girlfriend fell apart due to the amount of time spent on trying to fix this bike . I understand Critical Cyles is a small company and from the reviews..how amazing this bike is suppose to be . It just was n't meant to be . I wish I could go to a physical store of theirs.I would like to stress the fact that I have never returned anything I bought from Amazon before this . I am a prime member as well and buy almost everything through amazon . I hope companies can see that data with Amazon to check that fact . I feel really bad but I am way too frustrated to give them a third chance . My experience with the products left me very frustrated but the company was very responsive and caring . Amazon also did a wonderful job with the returns.2 stars !	-1
the bike aint all its cracked up to be . the rear wheel must have been put on with an impact wrench making the tool provided worthless needed a adjustable wrench with a cheater bar to get the nuts loose ! the rear hub had something wrong the rear wheel did not coast freely when i flipped it , returned it.P.S . do n't be fooled by this hand built crapolla makes you think it was made in USA ... not built in good old China .	-1
Ugh.You get what you pay for . In this case , two bad bikes and even worse customer service.The first bike I got was ok for about two miles . Coming home on the smooth , paved bike trail , both tires not only popped , but were absolutely bald.Sent it back , Amazon sent another , which arrived when I was out of the country for a month , which voided the warranty.The second bike was laughably better . There were actually reflectors for the wheels , decent appearing pedal cages , a visibly better brake , and visibly better tires . I actually had hope ! Until I learned the handlebars would become loose after any patch of bumpy road , and the chain would pop off only when I used the brake , meaning I was sliding through intersections.It had to go.I emailed the company , got a stock response asking for my phone number to call back , and I gave it . No call.Emailed again . Same response , gave my number , no call.Called the company , never called back . Probably blocked my number.Thank you , Amazon , for coming through when this horrible company could n't . I got a full refund , even though more than a month passed.Bottom line : Save your money and buy a decent bike . You get what you pay for , and you want to pay for a better ride .	-1
I wear a 71/8 fitted hat comfortably . I am keeping this around as a backup but the thing chokes out my brain . I am hoping it breaks in but so far no joy . If you have a big melon at all , do n't waste your money .	-1
I bought this for my SW MP15 .22 and it works great , easy to install and it holds a zero . Its pretty robust and looks bad ass . I like the zero magnification and its easy to adjust the brigtness and chage the reticle . It didnt come with a dust cover I am guessing due to the little shade over the lense which is fine with me as any old sunglass microfiber bag works perfectly and covers the whole optic instead of just the lense . Adjustments are easy and it just uses a little allen wrench so you dont need another tool like a star drive or something odd.CUT TOO 1 1/2 months later.it is n't robust at all and it looks good still but my 12 inch group at 25 yards looks like crap so not very effective . Within 3 trips to the range it was n't holding zero , by trip 5 it was bouncing around soo badly from the recoil its unusable . Even the pro at the gun shop was shocked at how bad it was off the recoil from a .22 . Its simply crap not even good enough to survive a .22 and trips to and from the range . I am sure the warranty isnt any good either so ill chock it up to a HUGE WASTE OF MONEY and buy something better . I could n't even find a company to locate or call about the problem SERIOUSLY WTF .	-1
I have had mixed result with & # 34 ; V & # 34 ; sharpeners . I spent an hour trying to sharpen a rapala fillet knife . Now , anybody who has a Rapala knows that they use good steel . After an hour I tried to cut something and my buddies were laughing at me . I am not amateur . I like my knives razor sharp , I shave with a straight razor and I know how to keep THAT sharp . I am so sorry I bought two of these based upon reviews . There is nothing like a good stone .	-1
& # 34 ; Constructed nicely , works about as good as any knife sharpener of the exact same kind ... not that great . I did like the rod for sharpening serrated blades . You have to be really careful while using this , knife has a tendency to strike the metal as drawing it out of the & # 34 ; v & # 34 ; notch . You 'll be lucky to cut paper after using this , lucky. & # 34 ;	-1
I got one of these as a present , and not only was the ceramic section on the angled side broken in two , but the ceramic rods showed signs that whoever packaged it decided to swipe their blade through it a few times before sealing it up over in China.Next - they wanted me to PAY postage to return it for replacement ! ESAD is my opinion on that !	-1
Thanks yakima ... Most people are convinced these racks are made in USA and it appears they used to be but no longer are so . Even worse is the labeling that states `` made in china-designed in USA '' They know right away how bad it is to have `` made in china '' on the box and actually think we will look the other way because it was designed here . Hilarious ! I understand the warranty used to be lifetime ... well no longer . Some legalize limited warranty mumbo-jumbo.Note the price has not dropped one cent . The higher-ups at yakima have obviously laid off USA workers , increased profits for themselves and not passed one cent savings onto customers.I base all this on a stack of 6 brand new boxes of this exact model just delivered to a local bike shop in El Paso TX.Right next to this stack were several brand new Thule Parkway racks . Made in USA Lifetime warranty . How can Thule accomplish this yet yakima can not ? I imagine some loyalty on Thules part and greed on yakima 's part.My advice.. pass on this model . china has a reputation for cutting corners on such products . You do not want your multi- $ 1000 bikes hanging off some cheap chinese made junk at 70mph ... do ya ?	-1
I try to use these when cleaning my pistols , but it seems like all the carbon is replaced with lint . It 's kind of annoying . Do n't get me wrong , there are a lot of patches and they clean well , but next time I will buy something else .	-1
Fair price for the variety of lenses , comfortable fit and good performance under everyday situations . I prefer eyewear that wraps my face since I use these mostly for cycling , and this particular style fit that requirement.My main gripe for the Tifosi Podium is how fragile the lenses are , especially at the nose bridge . I snapped one lens while removing the nose piece , and another lens when frame fell off with the lens hitting an edge close to the nose piece . Single-piece lenses all share this weakness , but due this being `` frameless , '' the lack of support is a big risk/flaw . I have one remaining lens to go and will continue to use them until they snap in half . It 's not worth buying replacement lenses for this particular frame since they all suffer the same inherent design weakness.Another Tifosi product similar in style is the Logic . It looks like it 's sturdier since there 's some frame over the top of the lens piece . It might be worth checking that out instead if the Podium 's design appeals to you .	-1
Order arrived a day early even though it was delayed in Mesquite , TX for 3 days due to Hurricane Isaac . Seller responded quickly when i inquired on status . Seller and Amazon gets a 5 star but the product only gets a 2 star . The m4 mag pouches are smaller than spec and it was tight getting the Tapco mag out . You almost do n't need the bungee retainer cords . Mag pouches worked better using metal mags though . I 'm trying to convince myself that this will work but i may have to return this one .	-1
Its was a gift for my sister.I see the reviews said `` its run small '' and i sort LARGE size.When she try put the gloves in your hands , '' '' SURPRISE '' '' its ridiculously small , tight , and dont have padding.This gloves is for a little hand child not for a women hand.I DONT RECOMMEND BUY THIS ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
I wish I could review this but I never received it . I was sent a holster instead . I bought it to use on a hunting trip . When I called customer service and told them my problem , they told me to buy another one . Awful .	-1
Yea , this is essentially a nylon strap . If you want to use it as a gun belt , you will need to take the buckles off to thread it through your holster . My Dickies leather work belt does just as good .	-1
I was not impressed with this holster . I was going to be using it for a full size P250 but putting it on my vest i realized you cant even grip the gun because of the back of the holster . Also the thumb release is all wrong and getting it back into the holster is a chore because of the velcro on the bottom is poorly made . Not worth the buy .	-1
2 start 2 big . out in the wild going to battle ! tried for airsoft and was givn away too a friend .	-1
Not impressed with this spotting scope at all . Was hoping for a much easier and clearer view and adjustment knob . I have seen others which are more compact with much better clarity and span .	-1
Too small and not enough string camo coverage . Will not fit a large 6 ft plus guy . Does'nt seem made very well . I ca n't see it holding up very long if used properly .	-1
Its nothing what the picture looks like . Its made and has the colors of military camo army fatigue . YOU WILL GET SPOTTED !	-1
ok not after one month it rip on the top strap on the double clip side . i guess you get what you pay for	-1
I 'm sure im the only one here who bought this to use for a REAL GUN . This is at best a novelty item more for a costume or airsoft . I was hoping to use this for a little while on my Ruger SR series because no one really makes a holster for it yet , after some serious adjustment it still fit loose and the main strap was of no use . Being only 10 bucks ill just keep it and use it for Halloween .	-1
cheap . these thinks are so cheap there is almost no fabric to absorb sweat . I wish I Just would have bought a couple nice ones .	-1
When new they look good but then you put them on , they are very thin . If comparable Wilson headband can hold 2-3 matches , this one is not enough for one match.It is too thin.It is soft and looks good , but after wash it becomes drab .	-1
Should have trusted the reviews here that they would n't work . Watched a YouTube video about how a guy made them work , tried his modifications on one of the clips and it BARELY fits and is near impossible to load . Do n't waste your money on ANY repro SKS clips , find the real deal or nothing .	-1
Do n't buy these stripper clips . They do not fit my russian SKS at all . spend the extra money and get surplus	-1
They look good , load good , are great condition but ... ... They dont fit your action.. They do not fit into the bolt of a SKS without taking a file to the edges . I have order 2 packs , told some friends , ordered 2 packs for them and 2 more for my self again . I then found that they dont fit my either of my weaposn or my friends SKS ... If they dont fit in 3 of 3 SKS 's , I doubt that they will fit yours unless you feel like a day of using a file ... ... .	-1
These clips are too wide . Judging from other reviews they do not fit any SKS.Do not buy these clips	-1
Holds Small to Medium Size Pistols only ( beretta nano , Kahr MK9 , etc ... ) Does not fit revolvers ( Taurus Judge and Ruger 101 ) would not purchase again unless you are only using for compact or subcompact guns.Also the magazine holders on the side do not hold any of the following LOL1911 Single StackGlockRugerTaurusBerettaSigKimberActually I 'm not sure they are magazine holders , I ca n't figure out what they hold LOL	-1
Just an overall lack of quality.The laser has a sec delay in turning on . I thought that was weird . Every laser that I have own came right on . I received the scope with a windage knob that freely spun with no adjustment . The light shines on a metal ret . It feels real heavy and flimsy at the same time .	-1
Eye relief is bad . Hard to see unless you are in the just the right spot . I use it now just to look at deer in my back woods by itself . Useless for the most part on my gun .	-1
I understand that at $ 9 , expectations are n't high . But I would not take this knife even if it 's free . Two problems with this knife makes it very dangerous to use : first , the liner lock mechanism does n't lock . The blade will close accidentally and you 'll hurt yourself . Second , the blade is brittle . Again , you 'll hurt yourself . If you have this knife , inspect the liner lock carefully .	-1
Too heavy and hard to sharp . Not a good EDC option . I will re profile the blade for a basic around the house utility blade .	-1
You could really use your money better on a different set of knives . These are very small and light , which makes them inconsistent even at short range . I found them very difficult to throw . They also bounce like crazy and could easily hurt someone even if they 're standing BEHIND YOU . The only thing they do n't do is bend and break ( that I 've seen so far ) .	-1
This is a solidly built but poorly designed tool . It is essentially too short to get a good grip on and ultimately fails to do its intended job . There are better designed tools which are longer and have better handles with which one 's hands can get a grip . I 'd return it if the shipping did n't cost almost as much as the tool itself .	-1
The little tool removed my stock front sight on my Glock 19 and when I went to install the new Ameriglo Night Sight , I had much trouble getting the little screw started into the hole on the new sight . The tool is too short to get a good bearing on putting or starting the little screw . Then the tool is too short to get a good grip to tighten the screw . I 'm not happy with it , but it is only $ 10 , so I ai n't out too much . Too short .	-1
Do n't waste your money this product is very cheap made , will not get proper bite on tap and is not long enough to grip	-1
A great idea , but ( a ) the screw hole did not line up- the clip is made of solid metal , as it was very difficult to alter , ( b ) the mount of the clip is not flush with the gun- I have n't caught a fingernail on it but I 'm sure it will happen , ( c ) the gun is well concealed but at the price of making it difficult to draw.Major Issues : I 'm hoping I will find a work around , but for now ( 1 ) my LCP ends up at different angles on my waist and even s***s a bit on the belt . In testing this has caused about a second delay in my draw and ( 2 ) because of the depth of concealment the easiest part of the LCP to grab on the draw is the trigger . I do n't carry chambered , but I do not want to muscle-memory train ANY draw by the trigger .	-1
Used this for my ID/Access badge at work for 6 months . Broke twice at the strap and finally where the strap is glued to the main body . Luckily I did n't lose my badge along with it . Needs to be redesigned to be more rugged for this price .	-1
I wound up returning this phone . It 's touch screen was very inaccurate and the phone was so slow , that I spent the majority of my time wanting to throw it up in the air and clobber it with a baseball bat . Spend a bit more money and go with a higher quality phone , if you can .	-1
Reviews on these cones have been generally positive . That is why I decided to purchase these cones from & # 34 ; Service Speed & 1 Year Warranty ! & # 34 ; and not the others . I liked how the listing says it comes with a carrier for the cones.But when I received the shipment , some cones had fallen out of the packaging and were just roaming inside of the amazon box . I noticed that these cones were on the thinner side and some had started to have slight curl to them . They were not as high quality and heavy duty as I had hoped . Also , upon further inspection , the carrier was not even included in the box ! So in the end , I received a poorly packaged item that was of low quality which did n't even include the main reason that I bought the thing ... the carrier ! I would 've given only 1 star , but since the return was handled quickly and without any problems , I decided to give 2 stars . I have since bought other cones on amazon which appear to be thicker and of better quality ( which is why I felt that these cones were not up to par ) .	-1
I wear 30/31 waist , so according to the sizing guidelines for these shorts , these should have fit me fine , but man , they were tight . I did some measuring and the waist band is around 24 - 25 & # 34 ; without any stretch !	-1
The reason for two stars is these pants are not good running pants . They 're a little too loose fitting , and the pockets are too deep . When you run , anything in your pockets flies around your legs and constantly hits you . I could see these being good for the gym , but I got them as running shorts and was disappointed : ( .	-1
This will mount onto a picatinny / weaver rail , but accessories will not mount to it . it does not have the width correct .	-1
I purchased this product for use on my Saiga 7.62 rifle . Although I eventually managed to adjust it to fit , this was no easy task . No instructions were included on how to fit the product to the rifle , and I suspect this may be the cause for some of the bad reviews this product has received . The mount will not attach out of the box simply by moving the throw lever to the attached position . It is necessary to slide the mount onto the receiver rail , and then tighten the screw connected to the throw lever . Although there are no visible threads , this will compress the spring for a tighter fit . When the screw is tight enough to retain the mount on the rifle , it will become clear that the label `` Quick Detachable '' is somewhat misused , as it is very stiff . However , after all this was resolved , a decent product because it allows you to eliminate the need for tools in the field in order to remove the mount should an optic fail . However , if it does not fit VERY SECURELY to your rifle , it may come loose after several magazines , leading me to suggest that one would be better suited paying the extra money for a higher quality mount from a better manufacturer like Arsenal .	-1
I do n't see what so many people are raving about . The convex surface distorts , therefore & # 34 ; images are larger than they appear. & # 34 ; If you have a large enough mirror , you can deal with this issue , but at the widest point this mirror is only 2 & # 34 ; across . I used this on one 10-mile trip and found it utterly useless for spotting cars . It 's simply too small , and the convex surface distortion only makes it worse .	-1
Yes , its ' lightweight and provides a large field of vision but cars look too small for me to feel safe with this mirror . It 's ok when I only have to look at 1 lane but 2 , forget it .	-1
Well , this may be my own fault , but i got this for a 20ga . The fit is VERY loose . Do n't suggest it so anything less than 12 ga	-1
I do n't really want to give this product a bad review . If the product description was better , it should have told me this would n't have worked on my 870 Super Mag . The Magpul 's website does have it clearly listed on their product page . I wish I checked that first . I blame Amazon 's lack of a comprehensive product description for the error . But the forend seems well built and light . I liked the fact you can attach rail mounts for accessories . My purpose was to add a Surefire flashlight . But now I will have to look elsewhere . Again , the two star review is really not a fault of the product , it is a fault of Amazon 's description .	-1
The quality is great , very nice fabric , the fit was fine , but I ordered the wrong color . I thought these would be a bit more khaki-ish , but they turned out to be a horrid not very dark brown . I stared at them and my wife gasped and said & # 34 ; You are sending those back ! & # 34 ; Returned them and ordered black instead .	-1
does not work the way I was expecting it to.I love the concept but the product does not easily load ammo . It jams and is a pain to use .	-1
I read the poor reviews of the magazine loader . I have other magazine loaders and thought that I would give this one a try . A lot of the usefulness of a loader depends on the user . After using this a couple times , I returned it for a refund . In my opinion , it is easier to reload a BX25 magazine by hand . I am now looking for something like an UPLULA . I have one of this and it is simple to use .	-1
Much smaller than I anticipated . Fits my little 3 year old perfectly though . She threw in some toys and after a few days some of the threading came off . I had to sew it back . Quality is poor . I would n't say it 's heavy duty if it can even stand some of my 3 year old 's toys . I do not write much reviews , but I had to write about the poor quality and workmanship of this .	-1
When I first got the bag I loved it . It looks great and the size looks a bit small when compared to a hiking bag , but I was looking for something compact for mobility . What you do n't realize though is how much this thing will pack . I just switched out this bag for another bag ( more on that later ) and I started realizing that I could contain more in this little bag than larger three compartment large book/laptop bag that I replaced it with . On this part alone I would have give five stars and it went beyond my expectations.HOWEVER , the straps were all a mess . The normal straps are usually stitched on to the bag and double d ringed to adjust length and such . This bag has it so that there is not real stitching connecting the straps to the bag . It 's all connected via D rings . And when you are not using the bag there is not enough pressure to secure these straps in place with the D rings . To make the matters worse the straps are not folded and stitched at the ends to catch the straps from D rings . The result ? You grab the bag and put it on and one strap completely comes off , one 's too long and only one is actually in place . Then you fix it and you put it back on and two straps comes off.I bought this bag to act as a bug out bag , but with the straps being this unreliable I could n't even use it to go on hiking let alone use it in emergencies on a run . I tried rolling the straps myself and used carabineer to secure the straps and I got it to stop coming off the bag completely , but the strap sizes are still freely changing . I just gave up and got another bag instead.Definitely would not recommend to anybody .	-1
I have a women 's bike so i do n't have the tube to put this on . Instead , I velcro it horizontally on my handle bar . The velcro strap is just long enough to secure it firmly . I have an HTC Sensation with a glove and it fits fine . My main purpose for this purchase is so i can use the GPS on my smartphone . unfortunately , this is no good for this purpose . The plastic film that covers the smartphone screen has a glare and you ca n't see the screen of the phone ... it looks pitched black ! So- pass on this product if you need view the screen .	-1
If you stand up to paddle , it will get in your way . I had to compromise by pointing my knees outward , and ultimately injured my knees . Returned it the next day.Also the velcro straps are too long and will not fit tight .	-1
The stitching is of such poor quality that the straps ripped out of the seam during my ride . I tried to use zip ties to keep it attached but I could n't get it to work . I returned it and paid $ 2.50 to return a $ 5 product . I asked for a replacement and I 'm going to try stitching the straps myself to improve the seam . The rest of the product seems of good quality so I am hopeful I can reinforce the seam to make the strap last longer . Update : the seller Jfly claims they did n't receive the returned item . So they banter back and forth over a $ 5 bag . Not worth the aggravation . I should have just tossed it in the trash instead of paying $ 2 to ship it back . The seller is overseas so I do n't expect much customer service . Buyer beware ! Update 2 : Amazon refunded the $ 5 . What a hassle over a cheap bag . I should have just kept it and sewn it back together myself .	-1

The one i received did not fit my galaxy s2 ( as in product picture ) and also it is lacking the headphone pass through hole and its the primary reason I bought this bag . it seems very floppy and not as structured as the one pictured .	-1
I will start of with the main issue of this mount THE LARGE HEX HEAD NUT ! As of TUE AUG 27 , 2013 . The seller sends me a mount somewhat like in his pics other then the nut that mounts this mount to your gun its a large 1/2in X 1/2 tall ! ! ! Not a small grooved thumb tightening round nut as showed in the seller pics . To add ever more probs to the mount it had TWO band saw cut marks right over the lights mounting screws ! At first glance I thought the rings mounting screw hole had cracked into I got it in the daylight and saw where what looks to be a manufacturing era due to it was painted over clear as day even in the shade RAY CHARLES could have seen theses cut marks . So now no matter what way I face the mount u will either see cut marks or have a LARGE nut in the way . The seller had to have seen this due to the fact it was in a small CLEAR zip lock baggy not a small box or anything like that then put into a yellow envelope . I contact the seller and ask how come the mount did n't have the right mounting nut and also the mount had cut marks . Id be ok with the mount if he would just send me the right nut . He replies would be acceptable if you return for refund ? Im think huh ? Do n't u think so ? But I was only ask for the correct nut . I never mention a refund NOR was I going to pay to return it or take time out of my day to go have it shipped back to the seller . I told the seller I skipped over a lot of theses type mounts due to the HEX head nuts and the only reason I bought this one from him was because it has the lower profile nut like I wanted . If I wanted something big a unsightly id stuck with the mount my light came with ! I let the seller know once again that I wanted the right screw on nut OR ! ! He would need to change his sells page and post pics of the correct type mount that hes selling . This guy clearly does n't care that hes wasting both of our time . I contacted amazon and made them aware of this issue and they agreed that it was misrepresentation on the sellers part and it would be handled and a full refund was entitled . I asked again that the seller sent me the right nut or changed his add and post true pics of the product hes selling . I would rate this mount with five stars hell its not the mounts fault it does its job unlike the seller ! Would be a great mount if it was n't cut in to a way it could break and had the right nut to make it were it did n't hang on everything like your sling !	-1
Fair , at best	-1
Ca n't find inexpensive light to fit it , I have tried a few 1 & # 34 ; and a little bigger and smaller lights . ended up buying a complete light and mount set . Not worth the hassle	-1
I bought two of these and the screws stripped out the holes . As soon as the screws started to snug down they stripped out . It was either weak material or a poor thread job on the holes . FYI I insert stainless steel screws into aluminum everyday at my job doing manufacturing and I know when something is not made well . Well these are not !	-1
Thought it would work better than it did . Does n't really work well on a Kel Tech KSG . It 's too short for the bottom rail and too high for the top rail .	-1
I purchased this blanket for $ 43.65 and man was I bamboozled ! ! The company markets this as a U.S. military blanket ; however , it is a Rothco blanket . It even has a Rothco tag on it , and Rothco blankets go for around $ 20.00 . This blanket is of terrible quality . I stretched it a little to see what kind of give it has and it began to tear , and now there is a hole in it . I never even got to take it out on a camping trip . I unpacked it , stretched it a bit around my shoulders , felt how poorly made it was , and to my disappointment it actually tore . This blanket is n't even worth the $ 20.00 it is supposed to be sold for.I am not a picky person , or a terribly tough critic , I had the most high of hopes , and I was entirely let down . Moreover , seeing as how I had already torn the blanket , I did a burn test on it . The results are in ... the blanket caught fire after only three seconds of exposure under the flame of a bic lighter . Moreover , my entire house smelled like burned hair for a whole day . I have thought about cutting up the blanket and repurposing it for something else but I do n't want any part of it . It will in all go to the trash can.Another thing to note . This blanket is not woven at all . It is uneven in the pressing . When held up to the light there are very thin and thick areas . Some of the thin areas are so thin that you can with very little pressure poke your finger right through the middle of the blanket . That is not the kind of blanket you pay money for ; whether you pay the ridiculous price of $ 43.65 that I paid , or the $ 20.00 every other seller charges you for.I hope that everyone in the market for a wool blanket stops at this review and makes another choice . Good luck in your search for a quality blanket . I know that I will need it ; for I am back on the market in search for one that can replace this piece of trash . I would like to note that I did recently purchase the italian officer 's blanket and am more than satisfied with it . It is an amazing blanket ; one that I know that will outlast me and my descendants .	-1
This blanket is huge ! That 's why I gave it more than one star . It 's also paper thin and not even close to 100 % wool . You can buy a better one at any Army surplus store for a fraction of the cost . I paid too much !	-1
The Amszon ad for this item , `` Olive Drab Wool Bed Blanket , Genuine U.S. Military Surplus ; NSN : 7210-00-282-7950 . '' The NSN this ad depicts is for a Northwestern Wool Mills genuine USA Military Blanket as sold for $ 40 by NWWM on their own site . This turns out to be a Rothco fake . I could have bought a Rothco fake for $ 20 rather than the $ 48 I spent on this blanket . There is NO NSN stamped anywhere on the tag or blanket that was sent . The tag says Rothco 70 % wool 30 % Synthetic fibers ( non wool ) . The real genuine USA Military NSN blanket is made of 80 % virgin wool and 20 % recycled wool fibers . There is nothing I hate more than a bait and switch . I was to depend on this blanket to survive winter camping and bush crafting campouts . I can not do this with the fake blanket that was sent . Youtube video review also to follow this review .	-1
This blanket unfortunately , is not an authentic wool blanket . It definitely has wool like qualities , but fully wool..uh , I say `` Nay-Nay '' . I actually purchased a truly wool blanket from a place called Faribault Wool Mill . These Blankets are legit ! ! ! ! ! ! Be warned , they are extremely pricey .	-1
This mug/cup holder can be a good idea BUT it SHOULD be done MUCH better ... .FIRST : see pic ( # 1 ) where you can detail the junction between the ring and the cup holder ... . mediocre ... .HORRIBLE , I do n't wa n't something on my bicycle that is out of tune with it.SECOND : The design of the ring of the holder is ILOGICAL , see pic # 2 , it is notched SO you CA N'T rotate it to match in a proper way the handlebar . That 's why there are many complaints about proper fit . It is impossible to make a tight adjustment over the handlebar.Probably it does its job but this one is not going to be on my Schwinn bike . I will pay much more if I find one that is well made.Thanks , if this review & pics were helpful , please v ...	-1
Cheap quality at cheap price . Most of my cycling clothes are by Perl Izumi and this cheap quality can not be compared . PERIOD ! this is a cheap copy with so many flaws ... padding are n't thick enough , material is stretched after 2 wash , Shorts can be pulled up to cover most of your stomach ( someone asked me if I was wearing a bib ) .	-1
I wo n't rate it one star because : it was n't broken , it functioned at it was supposed to and it does n't seem obviously harmful in any way.That said , I really do n't know why you would use it unless your arms are just incredibly weak . The reason being that it just simply is n't as good as doing push-ups ( even the half push-ups where you do them from the knee ) . You can get a far better work out from just doing different types of push-ups . I can feel much more in my arms with a regular push up and a regular push-up also works my abs and chest ( this one deprives of that because of allowing you to support your weight on the chest pad ) . The three resistance bands do make it adjustable , but even the `` highest '' resistance is n't as much as just doing a regular push-up.Also , this kind of hurts . It encourages you to support your weight on your chest . ( In fact , your arms get a workout by levering against the weight you place on the chest pad . ) I am a female ( with female parts ) but both I and my boyfriend found that the pressure put on your chest discouraged us from using it very long.On a related note , I do n't think it would support some one with a lot of weight ( fat or muscle ) . It 's sturdy enough when you 're on it properly , but if you shift back or forward a bit , it gets unstable . Also the heavier your upper body the more force you will place on your chest and the more uncomfortable it 's likely to be.Construction was easy . Agree with other commenters that the metal in some places seemed flimsy , though I was n't concerned it would break on me ... seemed acceptable even if not overly nice . But I did also have the issue of the red vinyl on the flat area below the chest pad coming up ( out of the box ) and being kind of a sticky nuisance.Other comment - it claims you can slide it under the bed for storage . Unless you have an abnormally high bed or are willing to disassemble it every time ( which I do n't think the lock nuts would survive more than a few times ) I do n't see how this is true . It most definitely is not even close to being able to slide under my queen bed ( not that that 's where I 'd put it anyway , but just saying )	-1
My husband and son were anxious to try the Push-Up Pump out . When it came , the assembly time was a bit long for the outcome . It took about 40 minutes to get the device together . Once together it just takes up too much space and there is no way to fold it or store it . Something to consider if you do n't have a workout room or extra space.The device itself is useless . Ladies , if you are endowed on top ... forget about it . There is no way to safely position yourself without causing damage to your wrists or back.For everyone else , I still feel this is a useless device . If you can do a pushup ... why do you need it ? If you ca n't , it is safer to work your way to push ups the old fashioned way . To build up to full pushups , push the Push-up pump aside and start with knee pushups . If that is too much , use the wall and stand up . You will still work your way up to a full pushup . You wo n't have something bulky taking up space in your home and you will probably have much better form.I 'm sure this is useful for some but I feel like it 's a huge waste of money . Do n't get me wrong , I love workout gadgets ( Thighmaster forever ! ! ) , just not this one .	-1
Great idea , but if you are a female with any real chest this can be very painful to even try . Even some men will find this to be very painful to rest their chest on the center piece . So a very great idea , but not or me or mine . Our chests are just too sensitive and not rock hard .	-1
The Push-up Pump , like most work out products , works `` ok , '' but has a painful downside.The Push-up Pump comes tightly packaged inside its box . After lifting the main frame out of the box , you 'll have to cut several tightly secured plastic straps that are holding the arms together . I had a hard time cutting these thick plastic straps ( with a knife and scissors ) and wound up pinching my skin twice just to get the thing ready for assembly . One of the problems is that the straps are too close to the metal supports , and therefore you ca n't get a good angle to position your scissors for maximum cutting leverage . After you hurt yourself unwrapping it , you 'll have to use a couple of nuts and bolts to get the arms in place . Sliding the arms into place and screwing the bolts on is another opportunity to get a finger caught somewhere . After that , you 'll have to attach the bands to each pole . The bands have a cheap plastic clip part that you 'll have to manipulate to snap onto the mini posts located on the inside of the arms and , once again , represents a fine opportunity to bust a fingernail . As some other reviewers have mentioned , the red mat material surrounding the chest piece curls up at the corners and requires glue to smooth down.Anyway , once you get the device put together , the included DVD shows you how to correctly perform some sets . I can routinely do 15-20 normal push up reps , but by no means am I a big guy , so I was looking forward to using this thing . Well , I got on my knees , leaned onto the chest piece , grabbed the top two foam covered bars pointed toward the chest piece and began to prop myself up on my toes to start doing push ups . While I propped myself up , the red foam on the left handle quickly slid all the way off and I banged my forearm on the metal bar . As you can imagine , this hurt like the dickens and I had a pretty sweet bruise that lasted over a week.I applied some super glue to the left handle and slid the red foam grip over it ( the other foam grips seemed to be secure after I tested them ) . After that set for a day I cautious got back on the push-up pump . Surprisingly , I kind of like the device . It takes some getting used to , but it does make push-ups a slightly more fun and I enjoyed the multiple grip positions now that the red foam grips were securely attached . By no means does the Push-up Pump provide a complete body work out , though . It 'll work your chest , triceps , and biceps , but you 're not going to feel much of anything in your legs or abs . Unfortunately , the resistance bands are a minimal addition to your work-out . Like I said , I can do 15-20 push up reps routinely , and I quickly realized that all 3 bands did n't provide as much resistance as I would have preferred . But the device lets you rip off fast , rep-heavy sets and will slightly tone up your chest and arms over time . Just do n't expect it to add a lot of mass or strength -- I think it does a better job building muscle endurance . The other thing to note is that some girls tried it out , but half of them complained it hurt their chest too much . The chest pad is harder than you think ( it 's not memory foam or anything like that ) .In conclusion , I sorta like the Push-up Pump and would recommend it to people who want to build some muscle endurance or for people who struggle to do 5 regular push-ups . Normally , I might have been inclined to give the Push-up Pump 4 stars . The downside is that you might end up with bruised fingers and arms setting this thing up , and thus the 2 star deduction . Just remember , if you do buy a Push-up Pump , be sure to check that the red foam grips are securely attached to the handles before you try it out !	-1
This is silly . Anyone can do pushups for free , w/body positioning & furniture : Knee pushups . Yoga prone back-bends-w/arms . Wall pushups . Table pushups . Chair pushups . Box pushups . Limited-range pushups from top position . Isometric holds from any position . Negative-only pushups . Planks . Soon you 'll be doing real pushups .	-1
This product makes me a little nervous , though I think it 's a good idea and could be a great product if a few changes were made . The three tension bands the Push Up Pump comes with help offer a variety of challenges to the user . The easiest band makes doing push ups a little easier than they normally would be without this product . The strongest band makes push ups harder , offering a good challenge to those who want to increase their limits . The middle band is in-between , making push ups about the same difficulty as I would have without the Push Up Pump.In theory , it 's a good idea . What I do n't like is that the machine is that it seems to want to tip forward when being used . It does n't feel sturdy enough on it 's base , and if I were to fall forward on top of it during use if it were to tip over , I think I could get a decent injury from it . I 'm concerned that the safety of this product is severely lacking , especially for users who may not be as in shape or are overweight . Falling onto this product if it tips could yield very serious injuries , I think.I would like it better if they lengthened the base so that it would NOT tip even if you leaned into it . If you are n't using it just right and balancing yourself well , it wants to tip . I watched this happen for my husband also , it was leaning forward a bit when he was using it and it made me nervous . He is an in shape person , too , who frequently performs push ups.One other thing that as a woman I do n't like is where you rest your chest . I 'm currently expecting and one of the side effects for many women during pregnancy and also changes in hormones during the month for non-pregnant women is a tender chest . True , this is n't an issue for all women . But if you are a woman who experiences hormonal changes that increases chest tenderness at times , then this is probably not a product you 'll enjoy using . It was VERY uncomfortable for me.Finally , while the rest of the product seems to be well made , the fabric padding on the flat surface , under the pad where you rest your chest during use , was peeling up upon opening the box . It arrived that way . While this does n't affect the quality or performance of the Push Up Pump at all , it does n't look food , with fabric peeling up.I think this product was a good idea , but definitely needs some work to get it to be a safe , comfortable machine to use . For now , I 'd recommend passing .	-1
Being an avid workout nut and weightlifter , when a piece of equipment like this comes onto the market I am always elated to give it a try and see exactly how they are `` revolutionizing '' the way people are suppose to work out.This Push-Up Pump rises to the task and accomplishes nothing new , SAVE YOUR MONEY ! EDIT # 1 : For clarity , I 'm 6'2 '' -6'3 '' , 235 pounds . The device feels wobbly under my weight . There is no mention to the maximum weight , so use cation . Also when using the device and I push the handles down my chest does NOT rest on the padded seat as intended due to the long reach of my arms.EDIT # 2 : After continued usage ( after all I do like to give everything the best possible chance to impress ) , a few of the bushings/joints have loosened up and I have had to retighten them . I 'm going to assume this is due to the weight I am putting on this device.Also I 'improved ' my unit by adding my own resistance bands . The stronger bungees I am using definitely adds more resistance and can feel it more so . Obviously I take all liability by improving/modifying it.The Push-Up Pump comes more or less preassembled out of the box . All you have to do is unfold it , tighten two bolts , and attach the 'resistant bands'.Using the device is straight forward . Put your chest on the seat , grasp one of the three handles and do a pushup.Having all three resistant bands attached for the most resistance , I push-up pumped myself for a solid minute and felt only a slight burn in my shoulders . Whereas if I do a wide grip NORMAL pushup without this contraption , I can feel it in my back and shoulders to a higher degree.Changing your grip while on this machine does engage different muscles just like they say ... BUT the same can be done without this device by changing the the position of your hands when doing a pushup on the ground . Place the tips of your pointer fingers and the tips of your thumbs together for what is called a diamond pushup which targets your triceps the most and your chest and shoulders secondarily . Or position your hands on the floor just outside of your shoulders for a wide pushup which mainly works your chest and the front of your shoulders.The ONLY redeeming thing about this device is that it does assist you when doing a pushup . So for someone starting out or has issues doing a normal pushup , this may be a better choice.My personal recommendation , save your money and buy some free weights , jump rope , and some new tennis shoes , you 'll be happier with the results from those than with this thing .	-1
I mainly got this with my 16 year-old son in mind , who 's constantly doing pull-ups and runs everywhere . He used it for about five minutes then pushed it under the end of the bed where I found it a couple weeks later . The benefits of this little machine are way over-hyped . The only likely plus I can see is that it keeps your arms in closer to the body ( or at least better positioned ) . Unfortunately , it feels very unstable and shaky , although I imagine once you get used to it that ceases to be an issue . Both my son and I also had a problem with the resistance cords getting in the way of the machine as it flexes , and I did n't notice much of a difference between one cord and three . Worst of all it arrived with the red backing ( under the chest pad ) peeling away . It does n't inspire confidence in the workmanship when that 's how it comes out of the box .	-1
I 'm what you 'd call a skeptic when it comes to home fitness . I definitely think that there are plenty of useful products on the market , you just have to be astute in your research . A common issue for me , though , are the products that always sound too good to be true . You know what they say about that idiom ! I judge a product on what it promises and not what it actually does . In the case of the Push-Up Pump , I do think you can target certain areas of your body ( specifically arms and chest ) but the device guarantees much more than that . With the bold proclamation that this is a total body workout , the Push-Up Pump sets false expectations even if you might get some use from it.A lot of reviews have already covered the details of this product in a comprehensive manner , so I wo n't even attempt to do so . I 'll just add personal observations as I tried to make this a part of my daily regime . Having given the AbTwister a try , the set-up of the Push-Up Pump seemed very familiar with some of the same materials and specifications ( 3 different tensile settings and that bright red plastic ) . The machine itself was easy enough to put together . As it was going to be used to support a more substantial amount of weight than the AbTwister , however , I was a bit nervous about the construction and quality . So far , though , nothing terrible has happened in regard to workmanship and for that I 'm grateful.Let 's just say that using the Push Up Pump is awkward and somewhat unnatural ( at best ) and potentially dangerous ( at worst ) . You are offered three different hand positions . Using these and following the enclosed DVD , I definitely noticed the burn . As I mentioned , I felt there was good concentration in my arms ( of course ) and throughout my chest and upper body . The primary problem , though , is that I 'm in perpetual fear as I use the device . If one thing goes wrong ( either in the equipment or in my dumb self ) , I feel like I could impale myself in a very unpleasant way . And maybe I do n't have enough trust in something that I 've put together myself.As this might be my issue alone , I 'd give the Push-Up Pump three stars for the workout that it does provide . But as it has overpromised in its advertising campaign and marketing as well , I 'm down to two . Another fitness product to end up unloved in my household . For now , I 'll stick to traditional push-ups that do n't cost hundreds of dollars in equipment . KGHarris , 1/13 .	-1
Got this , and it was tied together very well with large cable ties . All of the grips were well wrapped in Chinese cardboard . The first problem came in that it was not well packaged inside the box . The box was way larger than the unit , and that allowed it to bounce around . Although the unit was in useable condition , the nuts that are supposed to hold the pivot bolts in place fell out of the box during shipping . With only tape across the top and bottom long seams , the ends of the box were open for small parts loss . So I started the quest for a couple of nyloc nuts . After a 15 mile round trip to Home Creepo , I got it assembled . The chest pad sits on a 8 & # 34 ; x8 & # 34 ; metal plate , and it has a 3/16 & # 34 ; black rubber backing , on top of which they put a piece of red plastic . That plastic is all folded up and not affixed to the black pad ( only aesthetics , but a minor strike nonetheless ) . My first attempts at using it were met with a minor learning curve with the grips , and what works for my body type . I have fairly wide shoulders , but find the outside grips utterly useless . The close in grips work well . The top horizontal grips will take some getting used to , but there is a small window where the chest pad works , and outside of that it too is useless . I have a fairly developed chest , or at least enough to give me some padding from bone , but the pad still causes problems . I completely understand how women would find the chest pad a deal breaker . In the 24 hours that I 've had it I only have about 70 P/U 's into it , so it 's way to early to call it a loss . I have also not attempted to use the bands.If someone were to ask me does it make push ups easier , or more fun , I would say just the opposite . I would offer that it might tend to help people who do not have good form start to understand the mechanics of a push up . At my age the initial pain from new exercises takes about 2-3 days to develop , so I ca n't tell you if I can feel any benefit ( pain/soreness in your muscles equals benefit - do n't care what the new aged fitness coaches say ) . I 'm going to give it a few more days , and will follow up , but unless it starts to reveal some magical potion , I am leaning toward sending it back .	-1
This thing hurts . I do not have a lot of upper body strength , so I wanted to try this out to see if I could improve my arm and chest strength . It 's not hard to assemble or use . You just grab onto the handles , put your chest on the pad , get into the plank position , and push down . It also has attachments you can use to make the push-ups more challenging.It does make it easy to do a push-up , but the pad in the middle HURTS . I tried adjusting my position and even put a stuffed animal over it to add more cushioning , but this thing is just not boob-friendly . My husband gave it a whack and said it hurt his chest , too . Maybe this is mainly for really overweight people . They would have more padding , so maybe it is n't as painful ? I do n't know . If you are bony or have boobs , then this is probably going to hurt.It is also not very easy to store , unless you have a lot of free closet space , and it is selling for $ 100 , which is entirely too expensive for a machine that does n't work well and does only one thing.I would not recommend because of the poor chest support , the inconvenient size , and because it is way overpriced . Get some weights and a work-out DVD , not this .	-1
This device would be good for those who ca n't do a set of pushups on their own . Or somebody that ca n't do a regular pushup and they do n't like doing knee pushups . This machine makes pushups easier and it provides multiple hand angles . Honestly those little handles you can buy to do pushups on would allow for more versatility and they are much cheaper . They also fit in a drawer . This thing will store in a closet , or garage , or get pushed to the street eventually . It is not a practical device . It also hurt my chest a little bit . The padding is not good in the chest area . I would imagine a woman would not be comfortable using this . That eliminates this products main audience . Overall , this is a product that defeats itself .	-1
Very unhappy ... purchased this item , received COMPLETELY different pack of a completely different branding . Attached retail tag was written in highly broken English . Pack I received has no side pouches , only one small front pouch on outside of larger front pouch on outside of main compartment . Zippers feel cheap , shoulder straps are thin , and plastic buckles feel cheap and easily breakable , lots of sloppy single-row stitching which is sure to come apart with very light use.Ugh , so tired of ordering things on Amazon and getting cheap knockoff Chinese bull**** instead . Do yourself a favor and physically go to a retail store and purchase a quality pack . That 's what I 'm going to do .	-1
Right after taking it out of the box , I decided to send it back . It has a lot of pockets which is nice , however the pockets on the sides are a strange shape that really would n't fit anything . Plus all of the zippers were very hard to work .	-1
This IWB was uncomfortable and had very little retention . I tried several different ones before settling on an OWB with adjustable retention .	-1
This holster is ok . I only gave it 2 stars because the material is very rough and it is uncomfortable . I do not recommend .	-1
I tried many times to get an answer as to why these lights did n't point straight . I made sure I used the template properly several times . I never could get an answer back from the manufacturer and no one was willing to replace them . Technically they work and are nice and bright . They 're just not useful past more than about 80 feet .	-1
The hammer would only drop every other time . I discovered that the extra tension on the back of the frame was enough to cause this ... . Too bad , I really liked it but am not willing to sacrifice the reliability for convenience . Techna-Clip did offer to refund my purchase .	-1
Bought this more as a joke because I had extra money . Its FPS sucks the mags suck , the battery sucks , and the range sucks . Despite all of this it could be used CQB with better success than outdoor airsoft . The best thing about this gun is its size . It can be collapsed tremendously for CQB . If you really want to use this gun buy several extra mags .	-1
The option for fit above it to limiting . I 'm 5'5 & # 34 ; 175 lbs and when I run I think these fit just right . When running , they 're great - do n't even know they 're on . They wick away moisture great . Very comfortable WHEN RUNNING . When walking though , before OR after a run , it 's like the cut is off and there is n't enough fabric in the back , because WHEN WALKING , they pull up into my crotch . I 've worn them on 3 runs to make sure it was n't me . I 'm white , I 'm slightly over weight , but I do n't have a big butt and no other short has ridden up like these . Maybe I got a badly made pair , but I just ca n't recommend them .	-1
I 've been wearing these to the gym and if you make a wrong move the entire gym gets to see your private parts ! Maybe if you 're just running they 'd be ok .	-1
Did not like it at all . Do not buy it , very nice pistol grip , but the way it attaches makes it feel cheap .	-1
The finish is not as clear as I was expecting , I have seen mirror shined steel before and this has n't been taken to the level of clarity that it needs to for a mirror , it also scratches too easily , your better off getting the plastic ones .	-1
This thing seemed like it would work but if you do n't have a monster head or sticky hair it finds it 's way down and around your neck . It also pushes your ears outward making it very uncomfortable . I would suggest the Bas Rutten O2 trainer .	-1
These provide compression , but the legs ride up . So I do not recommend them .	-1
Not good for use with .308 caliber . First & # 62 ; not fitted it bigger than you need . Waste money . Will not recommend to any one	-1
First off I want to state that I really hate Le Stroud Knife . I like Bear Grylls Knife much more for several reasons . But I 'm going to try and give the LS Knife a fair chance . First the knife itself is made well and strong blade . But the pommel loosens very quickly . I REALLY HATE this sheath because of the way it 's retention is designed . I do n't know what the heck Les Stroud was thinking when he designed this . The knife is only held in by velcro strap . That 's it . So it 's fair to say that once the strap gets wet , you 're sheath is pretty much useless . True the sheath may come with a ton of stuff , but it wo n't matter when you lose you 're knife . The blade steel is better then the BG knife , but at least the BG knife wo n't get lost . OK knife . Horrific sheath design . Stay away from this purchase at all costs . Also this knife is also made in China , so Really theres nothing different about this than the BG knife . Buy the BG . If you do n't like it at least Gerber has a lifetime warranty .	-1
The knife might be OK ( I 'm not a real expert on the different grades of blades , etc . ) , but while opening the package the sheath fell on the floor and an edge broke off ! If it the sheath ca n't handle a drop from my kitchen counter , I do n't expect it to withstand much punishment in the wilderness . The Gerber Bear Grylls knife seems much sturdier.Gerber 31-000751 Bear Grylls Survival Series Ultimate Knife , Serrated Edge	-1
Was very disappointed in this product , it would not fit correct in my Gen 4 G35 . Made the firing pin and trigger reset very hard . I do n't know if I got a bad set but the fit was so tight in the sleeve that I finally gave up and tossed them for the factory cups .	-1
We had the Chili Mac as our first try of wise ... please save your money and invest in Mountain house ... if you are camping as we are or prepping as several others are..taste is everything , and I am sorry to say with wise it is not here	-1
I have gone through many holsters trying to find the best 'bang for the buck ' and I had VERY high hopes for the FOXX holsters . I purchased this holster for my LC9 to try and save some money . In the end I ended up getting a Crossbreed anyway . My recommendation would be to just get the Crossbreed and save yourself the money . The Foxx is SO close to being very good , it has the right materials , good retention , adjustability , and a good price . However for me , if they would just add a little more leather or change the cut it would have worked . The problem for me was that the leather did n't completely cover the grip , which then pinched my side between the holster and the grip . It was quite painful to sit , especially during long drives . I did endure it for the two months until my Crossbreed finally arrived , which was amazing to wear after the time with the FOXX . I even gave them another chance and purchased their IWB magazine holster for my LC9 . Again , good material , great intention , but the rentention on the mag was just too tight . When it is worn you REALLY have to pull hard to get the mag out . Now it lives in my drawer ...	-1
Cool looking watch , but not as cool as the picture makes it look . Yes it has an LED that changes color and THAT is kind of cool , but it only lights up a small bit of the screen . NO IT IS NOT WATER RESISTANT in the slightest . I washed the band with just a little water , neglected to dry it off , and BAM shorted LCD screen . $ 10 down the drain . Had it for about 4 days . Paid $ 8 for a watch at walmart , ALSO labeled water resistant , mind you , and I had it for 10 years . The band broke before anything else did it in . Great little watch and I had hoped this would replace it . NOPE ! The whole 'water resist ' plastered on the front made me think I could maybe wash my freaking hands with it , but no.FALSE ADVERTISEMENT	-1
Not good . Screen is faint and the lense broke rather easily . The rubber band wrist strap has a high latex content and I itch when I wear it .	-1
there were no instructions . the face does not illuminate correctly . the vendor sent twice the wrong instructions . they vendor has not a clue about this watch setup . there was no mention of an alarm function . it goes off on the hour and loudly at 11:30 pm . thinking of taking a hammer to it . also , the vendor has poor language skills . do not buy this .	-1
They are super thin , which would be fine , but no thermal and no riding . For sure not what I was expecting . At best you could call these running thermals	-1
The way these are sized , in order to get the wide bottom around our calf muscle where it fits securely , the top hem is squeezed around your upper thigh , reducing blood flow to your gracilis , vastus medialis , vastus intermedius , and other muscles in your lower thigh . When I move it down it 's no longer restricting blood flow , the lower hem is then below my calf muscle where it is too loose and flapping around in the wind . These need to be shorter . Such that the bottom part is around the calf muscle as designed , but the top hem is around our vastus medialis muscle ( the same place the hems of bike shorts are ) I would not recommend these unless you are okay with a noticeable reduction in power output or slight hypooxygenative muscle atrophy over your winter season . I took these on a 60 mile ride a cool winter morning and as soon as I lowered the upper hem my watts jumped about 15-20 watts for the rest of the ride and my legs felt much less fatigued . Unfortunately this also made it so the knee warmers were unattractively and uncomfortably bunched up at the topAlso , a note to people complaining that they fall down - knee warmers are designed to be put on underneath your bike shorts but over your thermal tights , this keeps them fitting securely .	-1
I purchased this set to be used on my Glock 34 for TARGET SHOOTING ONLY ! ! ! However , when combined with an ORIGINAL Glock 4.5lb connector , this set does not provide enough tension to rearm the trigger safety . The striker spring is just too weak ... it needs an extra 1/3 lb or so to be able to properly place the trigger into a position that engages the trigger safety . I decided to use only the striker safety spring and the trigger spring from the kit , keeping the original glock striker spring , basically defeating the purpose of my purchased . 2 stars only since I think people who does not pay attention may end up with an unsafe firearm .	-1
I am not pleased with this at all . The product I received did n't have the needed hardware , which could be in the description and I did n't notice . However , the cost for what it is without the hardware is n't worth it at all .	-1
Well it is a cheap sling . I will end up getting a better quality sling in the near future . The D-rings are plastic , the nylon strap is thin Chinese junk . It may say made in America in the description , that ca n't be true . I would n't so upset if it was priced closer to the quality . If I walked in to Academy and saw this sling I would expect it to cost about $ 10 not the $ 27.90 I was scammed out of .	-1
& # 34 ; Regular & # 34 ; cotton swabs ( i.e. , & # 34 ; Q-tips & # 34 ; ) do n't break as easily . While these may be long and wood , they snap very , very easily . Not a good value IMO .	-1
The pointy cotton end is dense and good for getting into the crannies . The round end is absorbent and good for reaching puddles . But the stick is weak , weak , weak .	-1
These are the cheap china crap . The cork grip is peeling off and I just opened them . I had to pry the disconnectiong straps out of the handle even with the button fully depressed . I put half my weight , I weigh 295lbs , on both poles and they bent . DO NOT BUY THESE ! ! ! !	-1
It did not fit my barrel . I would have needed some kind of spacers inside the ring to tighten it down properly . It ended up in recycling .	-1
I bought 4 of these new redesigned ones this year . I have 11 of the old ones that I 've been using for years and have not had a single problem . All 4 of the new decoys broke the very first weekend I bought them . I exchanged them for 4 new ones . Two of them broke the next weekend and one broke the week after . I returned them all and got my money back . Every single one of them broke in the same place . The area of weakness is where the body of the dove meets the plastic rod that goes into the metal stake that goes into the ground . I am very disappointed in the quality of the new redesigned dove , and needless to say I will not be purchasing any more of them until this problem is fixed.I would gladly pay the new price for the old version of the dove . At least I know those wo n't break every time I use them .	-1
I was not impressed in any way . The materials are cheap and I 'm thinking this whole kit could be found at the $ 1 store . The paracord was okay , but there I knew what I was getting . The key rings bent easily and 3 of the plastic wrist latches broke when trying to secure them .	-1
The bolts that hold on to the rail has one of them machined down flat , not sure why this was done except to fit multiple size rails . I would of sent it back but I am not using it on a heavy recoil gun .	-1
this holster is solid , as in it does n't flex or move.if anyone has any tips on how to speed up the break in process , cuz this thing needs it .	-1
This would be a great Tagua holster if I would have received a Tagua holster . I received a Cardini holster . I looked it up and it is the same manufacture but I did n't order a Cardini , I ordered a Tagua . Also the think smells of ammonia , I left it in my bedroom and when I came home the whole room was tainted with the smell.It will work to hold my gun but I am not thrilled with it .	-1
Do you have the older Perfect Pushups from about 8-10 years ago.Then you will cringe the first time you use this device . Cheap , the bearings are lousy , and the motion is not smooth . It 's unbearable . Look for them in a store where you can try them out , because you will not like what you get by mail . Like some things in life , the company has been sold and resold and cheapened the product to become unusable.The plastic is cheaper , the build is less , and the bearings are like gravel.If you ca n't find the old style that you are familiar with on auction sites ( I did , thankfully ) , then just go back to using yuor hands on the floor.A dud .	-1
These hurt my hand within the first 3 push ups . I had the original ones ... ca n't seem to find them , and those were waaaaay better than these .	-1
I 've purchased two other door gyms from different manufacturers , and I purchased this model because : ( 1 ) the price was right , ( 2 ) it looked like the padded panels on the ends of the bars would protect my door trim , and ( 3 ) I did n't want all the crap that came with other door gyms ( such as elbow straps or additional bars for alternate hand positions ) .A common problem with my other door gyms is that the foam either gets compressed , cut , or wears off , or the door trim gets dented from the pressure applied when exercising . The problem with this model is that the width of the padded panels are totally non-adjustable . In my door frame , the panels only gripped the door with about a half-inch on each side . Way too little to inspire confidence . At least with my other door gym , the fact that the gym is relying upon an extended foam-covered horizontal bar means that the width of the doorway is almost immaterial and no adjustment is needed.I 'm going back to the classic model and will simply wrap a few washcloths around the bar to prevent damage to the door frame .	-1
Easily the worst experience I 've had on Amazon.The main issue involves the two components that assemble to make the bar , which has the wrong hole orientations making it impossible to assemble.One of the components was also straight up broken and likely unsafe for use .	-1
i bought that mainly because my gym at the building was missing a good abs machine ... it 's overall a bad idea/design ... you swing back and forth no matter how slow and controlled you do the movement . Really annoying.also , last week tried to wash on the machine in cold water ... just the friction of the outer nylon textile with the washing machine drum completely destroyed it . it looks like it was burned in an open flame ! i can probably still use it but my other clothes were full of something that look like a black cottoni will try to post pics later .	-1
First , I did NOT get 1000 rounds more like 700 at most . Then they jammed my gun EVERY time ! This bag is a RIPOFF ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Worst garbage ever !	-1
these things are so horrible in the summer i bought bb 's for my airsoft squad and these things are so bad u its like a blind guy hitting a bull in the butt with a broom	-1
Does n't compare to toesox brand . Fabric felt cheesy and binding in the toe area and did n't care for the lack of choice in colors . Would not buy again .	-1
I like the quality of the material , the cooling effect and the length . I , however have 17 in biceps and these things are so uncomfortable I have to fold them down which is not how they are meant to be worn . This stops the cooling effect on that part of my arm and looks sloppy . I have even pulled them up to the crease between my bicep and shoulder thinking that would help . Nope ! They still feel like tight rubber bands . I will search elsewhere from my sleeves .	-1
These were less than half the price of another brand of sun sleeves offered on Amazon , and being a cheapskate , that caught my interest . But then I realized these have no UPF rating . UPF is the apparel equivalent of SPF , which we all know is for sunblock . The Eclipse and Coolio sun sleeves , which are almost triple the price of these ones , are UPF 50+.Also , the description for these sleeves say they block UV-R , UV-A , UV-B . I find that a tiny bit misleading as it implies it blocks 3 different types of UV rays . Not being familiar with UV-R , I googled it and found that it just means Ultraviolet Radiation , which includes UVA , UVB , and UVC . So really the description should more accurately just say it blocks UVA and UVB.Nit-picky it may be , but since my mother was diagnosed with skin cancer recently , I 've been pretty anal about sun protection and pay more attention to these things than I once did . You 'd be surprised how many misleading ( but perfectly legal ) statements are out there when it comes to sun screen products . I 'd rather spend more on a product I trust than save a few bucks at the risk of my health . I 'm not saying these sun sleeves do n't offer the same level of protection as the more expensive brands since I do n't know . I 'm only cautioning more awareness .	-1
I bought these for work and you can see that I obviously have tattoos under it . Its also not very flesh tone . I would think the black one would have worked fine though . I have really skinny arms and it fit really good just does n't work well as a tattoo cover .	-1
PROS : There are a variety of exercises that can be done with this ball . They are conveniently printed on the ball so you do n't have to worry about losing them . This is convenient and portable . You can work out on it just about anywhere.CONS : The plastic smells funny . Not exactly stinky but not good either.The instructions are insufficient . Set up simply states `` Fill the ball to 80 % capacity or a circumference of 163 cm . '' How ? There are no pictures . There was a white bit of plastic that did n't unscrew when I touched it . Nor did it seem to want to pull out . I had to wait for my husband to get home to fill it because I did n't want to break it . Turns out that it pulls out . Filling it seemed to be quite the workout . I was tired just from watching my husband . The instructions say to inflate the ball based on your height but give you no guide to go by . So you have to guess what is the right height for you.The pump and the ball were in separate plastic bags while the tip to the pump was just rolling around in the box . Fortunately I heard it before tossing the box . And because of the way the ball was folded , some of the lettering rubbed off.You 'd think a simple item like a ball could be used immediately . Nope . You have to wait two days . After filling it to 80 % , you wait 24 hours , then fill it the rest of the way and wait another 24 hours.2 STARS : This did n't make a good first impression on me . The workouts were so-so . They were n't ideally suited for me . The stretches were n't challenging enough while some of the exercises were more than I wanted to attempt .	-1
I thought this sounded pretty cool but in reality it has very limited use.It does fold down to save space but the amount of space it saves is pretty negligible . It folds down to about half it 's height with the rest of its dimensions remaining the same.It is sturdy , for styrofoam , but even the sturdiest styrofoam has a shorter lifespan than a hard plastic . Each folding and unfolding increases the risk to the integrity of the cooler.It is not airtight or watertight which also limits its usefulness as a cooler . You ca n't use ice in it.There are no handles so portability during use is n't easy.If it was a couple of inches higher it would be nice to transport milk in from the grocery store but it fall short there as well.So , while this seems to be a novel innovation , it is not something that I think most people would have a wide use for . Especially with it 's price tag . A decent soft sided cooler or a standard plastic cooler both offer more bang for their buck .	-1
This looks nice and the packaging is cool . But the flame is so very small . There 's a tiny screw on the bottom , which looks like it should adjust the flame but it did n't adjust anything on mine . I tried turning the bottom , but it wo n't turn . I had to get out my tool box to attempt the adjustment . I give up on this one .	-1
I purchased one of these items in a local brick and mortar sporting goods store on 5/4/13 . The gear comes in a plastic blister pack . Upon returning home and opening the package I noted that the C clamps are injection molded plastic . Not the greatest thing for clamping a $ 30 light to the edge of your boat that takes a pounding on waves and such . Upon close inspection of one of the C clamps there were manufacturing flaws in the center portion of the plastic with two very distinct cracks in the plastic , they were opposite each other , and ran half way through to the middle of the plastic . Had this been clamped on the transom or gunnel of the boat it would have broken within the first couple of bounces and the light would be lost over board . I returned the item to the store to exchange it . The two remaining packages they had showed the exact same cracks in the C clamp plastic just like mine and it was on the exact same clamp ( right side one ) in each of the packages . They checked their inventory and brought out two more , both having the exact same cracking in the C clamp . Clearly either a `` bad batch '' from the factory or an inherent flaw in every one that is being made.I suggest that a purchaser should consider buying local to insure they wo n't get a bad unit . And if you do order online , be sure to inspect your molded C clamps very closely for this discovered flaw in the batch we have in my store . If the clamp had not been faulty I would have kept the item because it would have served my purpose for the few times I would have needed it .	-1
Its not a recoil pad its hard as hell . Like other reviews said you can use it to extend you buttstock that 's it .	-1
If you do n't care what your AK variant looks like , and can find the screws to attach this thing to the stock with the metal butt plate still on the rifle , then I suppose this is the product for you , since it does increase length of pull , and somewhat reduces felt recoil , but in my humble opinion , it looks like doo-doo on the gun , and should have come with a pair of longer wood screws for mounting . The original screws on my WASR 10 were too short to take a good bite . Also IMHO , it is overpriced for what you get , and should be priced in the neighborhood of $ 5.Since the picture on Amazon shows the back of the buttpad , I just assumed ( I know , I know ) that you removed the original equipment butt plate and fitted the rubber one over the inletted stock , and that the front of this rubber pad was also formed to allow that . Nope , you remove the screws on the metal butt plate and screw this puppy to the stock with the metal butt plate still on the rifle ... as soon as you can find longer wood screws with the appropriate threads , that is.Took mine off the gun and threw it away . I have worked hard to make my wood furniture 1972 Romanian WASR 10 a manly thing of beauty , and this ... well , I threw it away ... nuff said . ... CC ...	-1
Sounded great on paper.Got it and it was at least 2-inches too short & did not line up with the holes by about a full inch.I have a Century Arms International M70 O-PAP AK 47 , factory stock.Sent it back and I did promptly get a refund.Too bad ... .. but thanks !	-1
I have an A2 birdcage flash suppressor and it will not fit over and very loose on barrel if put on .	-1

I do n't have to own this knife to know I do n't like Paracord handles . When they get wet , or dirty , or oil or grease gets on them , it 's all over.The come unraveled , too . There are too many good knives on the market to be stuck with Paracord . Do n't do it ! !	-1
First off , ignore anyone who said anything about a recall because they obviously are too stupid to leave the house without wearing a helmet . The recall was for the fullsize parang , not the compact.I should have known better than to buy a Bear Grylls Gerber product but I did it anyway . I took this thing on a weekend camping trip to play around with it and some other stuff I had . I tried chopping some branches for fire wood and was underwhelmed by it 's performance , and this was AFTER I put a hair-shaving edge on it with my worksharp . The weight and balance of it made it feel like it would have done much better . The handle is way too narrow but a simple paracord wrap took care of that . The lanyard it comes with is utter garbage , once again paracord to the rescue . The sheath is terrible but it covers the edge so at least you wo n't get cut . I did n't use it very much as I found my Marble 's Camp Cleaver was much better for cutting firewood but even still when the trip was over this thing was DULL . Did n't hold an edge at all.The overall design of the blade is good . The balance and heft feel good while still being fairly light and you can choke way up on it for fine carving tasks . If someone would make a similar product out of better steel that held and edge and chopped better and with a better handle and sheath I would gladly pay $ 100 for it . This particular product I regret even purchasing . If you want a good substitute for a similar price , get a South American machete like a imacasa or tramontina for $ 10-15 and modify it to your liking and make a sheath for it . You 'll be much happier .	-1
Just to mention this is the pre recall Parang . I 've had this machete for awhile , never put it to the test . I 've been using the Taylor Schrade outback machete ( GREAT machete by the way ) So I decided to put the Parang to the the test on some branch overhang.. It worked Ok no where as good as the Schrade . Noticed some sap on the parang , used some acetone to remove it . Now acetone is used to remove finger nail polish , also it seems very effective on taking off the Finnish on the Parang ! This never happened with the Schrade . Seems Gerber is loosing it 's quality standards . I do intend on sending this one back as per the recall , the recall is NOT a good sign ! ! Bye , bye poor Gerber .	-1
All the other dry fit shorts I have , were with a built in liner . these are just gym shorts , I am not sure why they have the dry-fit label . They are the quick drying material , but not the fitted liner shorts that originally got the Nike Dry-Fit name . So with these you need either jockey shorts or a jock strap to work out , which defeats the whole dry-fit purpose . As gym shorts they are overpriced .	-1
I have problems with my wrist so I wanted an extra thick mat for my occassional yoga practice . This mat does n't seem to be any different than others that I used in the past even though it is described as extra thick . It also is a bit slippery so you still might have to put another mat underneath . After starting to use the mat twice a week ( including a heated yoga class ) there were green little pieces all over the floor . At this point , the mat looks like its about to rip in places where i primarily place my feet and hands . I bought a different mat and am waiting for it to arrive .	-1
These are not cut like a normal man 's workout pant . They 're very tight in the thighs and butt , and then loose in the ankles , almost flared . I think they 're cut more like typical women 's workout pants . You would need to be pretty bold to wear these in public . That said the construction and material seems good .	-1
I bought this last spring to use at my camp . It comes with a nice bag , and two ( pillows , wink wink ) and its nice but not even close to being rated correctly . It was 40F and I was freezing in this bag ! Now I use it as a sleeve on my air matress . It works great for that .	-1
It simply does n't fit snugly enough even for minor usage . I ended up having to buy a magpul pistol grip which I highly recommend . This was a good idea but it just did n't fit into my bushmaster very tight .	-1
A little too cutesy . Not a durable mounting of the bottom piece . Did n't particularly like the top rod holder , can hit in the wrong place making it awkward to put a rod in.Buy something else .	-1
This would be a great little bushing but for one thing . It has changed the location of the hammer through looser tolerances . The result is that if you cock the gun , put the safety on , pull the trigger , the gun does n't go off . However , it does go off as soon as you drop the safety.My gun is bone stock , so this may be a problem for others . Its like the hole for the pin and or the outer diameter of the bushing where it goes into the hammer are both a little loose . This allows the hammer spring to push the hammer up far enough to where the sear barely engages . Hence you can pull the trigger with the safety on and leave the sear in a position where it will release as soon as the safety is taken off.I gave it two stars because the gun works but I would n't trust the safety from this point on . At least you have the magazine disconnect out of the way .	-1
It was nearly impossible to draw the pistol from the holster when worn as directed . The pressure of one 's belt pushed the thin plastic in so much it locked the pistol in .	-1
I have a bin of white socks I am always thrilled when I find my expensive nordstoms socks . these guys stretch out and wear out fast !	-1
These are the socks I normally purchase for my husband . Well let me rephrase that . Hanes crew sock are what I normally purchase for my husband . These were lesser quality than what I expected . It & # 8217 ; s almost as if these were made for an outlet store . They were bigger than normal , and not in a good way , because the lack of quality in the material . These were also thinner than normal . I will not purchase these from amazon again . I will wait for them to go on sale at the store .	-1
It seems the quality of most things has been on a very steady decline lately . Unfortunately Hanes socks are among the items taking a major dip . I have been wearing Hanes socks for the last 9 years and have witnessed the slow decline in quality and durability first hand.. I always purchase the same exact kind , hoping to get the same thing . Nope ! Upon receiving my order for these , I was shocked as I directly compared them to the ones these are replacing . I can honestly say that TWO of these current Hanes socks are about the same thickness as ONE sock of the earlier purchases . Yes , the material is VERY thin . Not only that , the socks seem smaller in size . As I say , I have bought the exact same type of sock for years now but they are both shrinking in size and in the amount of cotton they are using . Also , the cotton itself seems to be of lesser quality.I would say it is a safe bet that these socks will be wearing out very quickly . All the heels went out in my last batch in less than 2 months and I am retired so they are not subjected to heavy usage of any kind other than machine washing in cold water . Guess I will need to shop around in some brick and mortar stores to find a suitable replacement.Hanes , you USED TO BE good , now you pretty much suck ! Phooey !	-1
I should have purchased Wigwam socks ! My shoe size is 7.5 to 8 , and the Hanes socks I ordered were suppose to fit shoe size 6 to 12 . Well the gray heel is up near my ankle and looks silly sticking out of my shoes , plus not fitting properly . I washed them to see if they would shrink , they did not , plus they now look wrinkled and cheap ! Buy Wigwam socks , they have better sizing and quality , it is worth the extra money .	-1
Out of the 20 , 2 fit my sks . The other 18 are to big . I guess the reviews were right .	-1
these are junky and do not work for the sks , the grey colored stripper clips are the only ones that hold the rounds in place and they load smoothly with a push of the thumb . Problem is only place I have come across the grey ones is gun shows and those jerks want $ 2ea for them	-1
I own a Yugo SKS and these stripper clips do not fit the feed . They are too wide . I had read others having the issue but took the chance as many did not have this issue . I ordered these a long time ago so returning isnt an option ( serves me right for delaying ) . I will however attempt some modifications to make them fit properly . Sad sad day finding they dont fit . Lesson learned.. test product immediately	-1
Just tried to install a new mil-spec buffer tube on my lower . And each tab would lock into a slot in the castle nut . But could not get all 3 in at the same time . Each tab fit snugly in each slot . So I filed down each tab on the wrench just a little to square them . After that , it fit the castle nut I was trying to install . After filing down the tabs slightly , it also fit my previous AR-15 castle nut . Thick tool and should last . But the slight modification turned me off slightly . 20 years as an aircraft mechanic so not new to using tools .	-1
I replaced my flash hider with a muzzle brake that uses a lock nut instead of a crush washer . I bought this as a second wrench for tightening the brake and lock nut together ... but the slot for muzzle attachments does n't fit . It 's too narrow . What a waste of $ 10 . At least I still have my Tapco Armorer 's Tool . It 's a real tool , unlike this piece of junk . How can a stamped tool like this not even fit what it was made to fit ? !	-1
not happy with , scrap metal , did n't even fit the gun	-1
I bought this with reviews saying it would n't damage my castle nut , however it ended up scratching my buffer tube and castle nut ... it does work however .	-1
I got this , but the components of a riffle are very tight so , its almost impossible to loosen with this simple wrench . Also it leaves marks on the body when you try to take-down something .	-1
I really wanted to like this holster . I have a PM9 and really wanted to carry it , but this holster was no comfortable at all . Guess I will go back to keeping my PM9 in the safe . The quality of the holster is nice though , just not into IWB holsters .	-1
This is the third time I have rated this product and it is still a piece of crap . Gun will not release from holster due to design problems . I will be happy to send it back so you can see for yourself that the holster is useless.Let me know where to send it .	-1
hi i got the medium which is my size , to find out that it is too large , and not like the photo which shows that the space between the shoulder and the under arm is small , actually it is too big i do n't like it , and the worst is that i got 2 of them .	-1
First I was surprised with this tank top material quality but provided sizing chart has nothing to do with these tank tops sizes.ONCE AGAIN -- WRONG SIZING INFORMATION PROVIDED !

AWFUL PACKAGING AGAIN FROM SELLER `` Under Moments '' , THEY THROW ITEMS RIGHT INTO THE BOX WITHOUT ANY WRAP OR PLASTIC BAG ! ! ! CLAIM YOUR RETURN SHIPPING POSTAGE AS THIS ITEM HAS WRONG DESCRIPTION AND IT 'S NOT BUYER 'S FAULT ! TO AVOID PROBLEM SIMPLY PASS THIS ITEM AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE .	-1
Elastic loops vary ever so slightly , it is difficult to insert shells the first time . I am confident that they will stretch and be a little better .	-1
tiny tiny tiny little bitty wtfbelt very . not even worth 5 yen , or pescados in la mesa when I luv reviews	-1
i was really looking forward to this backpack . being made for the US army gave it additional guarantee ( so i thought ) it leaked heavily from the word go.i wrote back to them that their product is defective and leaks like a very faulty faucet and was told they would replace it . that was over 10 days ago and yet no sign of a replacement ( to be updated ... hopefully with a better review ) .	-1
When this arrived I was surprised at soft plastic pieces . I thought it would be a polymer with a little bit of strength ( enough to hold a flush mount laser solidly ) , but it seems to be normal grade consumer plastic ; as strong as something I 'd find in a happy meal . I think you might be able to mount a mini-cree flashlight with it and keep it pointed forward , but I do n't think you 'd be able to keep a laser zeroed in after any shooting . If I 'd known this earlier I would n't have purchased .	-1
This mat is OK , but if you are using it the way that I was ( which is for an aerobics routine ) , you quickly find that it will begin to break down /tare . Perhaps had I not been wearing shoes it might have lasted ... .alas , I do n't know because the needed a mat that did n't slide around . I ended up installing Interlocking foam tiles instead .	-1
The right should strap ripped the first time out . The rear zipper failed . Would not buy again . Spend a few more bucks and get something good , or spend a few less bucks and buy an issued alice pack .	-1
It protected the glasses very well , but the clip is a weak link.I could not recover the case so I do not know where it broke.The item was securely clipped to a D-ring on a backpack , then it was gone.The case worked well enough , I am sure my glasses survived their fall ... but that is only a guess.If you never use the tether , this case will do an adequate job of protecting eye glasses .	-1
I thought these would be useful for cleaning an AR-15 , but after getting them , I think I was mistaken . They appear well made and do n't fuzz like regular Q-tips .	-1
This cup collaspes very easy , and hot coffee or tea is on gloves and ground . Didnot work for me .	-1
Sportsman SSCC5 5-Ounce Stainless Steel Collapsible Cup & # 62 ; & # 62 ; & # 62 ; & # 62 ; & # 62 ; & # 62 ; & # 62 ; & # 62 ; & # 62 ; & # 62 ; & # 62 ; & # 62 ; & # 62 ; & # 62 ; & # 62 ; I never got this item , so I cant rate it on its use . I am hoping the seller sees this and make it good . Not a good experience so far . Make it good and I think could make it a 5 star .	-1
I have used this model for some time but I still like the old Schwinn Airdyne Evo Comp Exercise Bike . The overall smoothness of operation , The seat adjustment and other details are better on the Schwinn Airdyne Evo Comp Exercise Bike.Schwinn Airdyne Evo Comp Exercise Bike	-1
horrible and a generic home made pads for a premium helmet . do n't mess with this and buy the originals from Giro.The sticky velcro it came with does not even stick . overall a really bad deal , not even worth the hassle to return	-1
Have several AK 's and only One Mak-90 . This is & # 34 ; way & # 34 ; too long for the pistol grip of the Mak-90 . This is so long on the Mak-90 , that it sticks up through the entire receiver , so there 's & # 34 ; NO WAY & # 34 ; it could work , whether on the original wood grip or the ATI Fiberforce replacement stock . I compared on both . The Mak-90 grip screw is around half the length . Fortunately , there was a 2 & # 34 ; bolt provided with the Synthetic stock , so I used the Nut from this unit and it fit perfectly . You end up with a 4+inch extra screw and a ten plus dollar Nut .	-1
Weight wise , It was not what was advertised . I was looking for a light weight bivy sack for backpacking and this is pretty heavy so I sent it back . Looks like it would be a good unit if weight was not an issue .	-1
This product does not correspond to the description , and quite different than in the pictures.Parakord worst ever , he has a thin weak shell , it does not meet military specifications . I think it 's a fake.I advise you to choose another vendor .	-1
