I purchased my first Phantom when they first came out in January . I had been flying a Hawkspy copter with a low resolution camera for a couple of months and became hooked on aerial photography and the fun of flying . For less than $ 100 , the Hawkspy was a good value for what you got : Remote control Helicopter with Gyro and Spycamera ! ! -3.5ch Hawkspy LT-711 BlackA large helicopter capable of filming low resolution video . The copter flew okay in calm conditions , but any kind of breeze would make flight control difficult , to say the least . After a few landings in people 's backyards , and host of apologies later , I decided to upgrade my equipment to the Phantom and attached a GoPro3 Black edition camera to it 's hull.Flight control of the Phantom is vastly superior to the Hawkspy and video resolution of the GoPro is vastly superior to low resolution camera that came with the budget priced helicopter . For a toy , the Hawkspy is a good value for what it does . If you want an entry level , professional piece of aerial filming equipment , the Phantom is hard to beat for the price . My first Phantom cost about $ 670 and now you can find them for around $ 470 . A really good deal for a quad copter that is well built , is easy to control , and has GPS.If you read the other reviews , you will find as much technical detail about these quad copters as you want . I 've decided to write this review based upon experience and I have several recommendations:1 . With flying time , screws can become loose . Check screws on a regular basis to make sure things are tight . I checked the screws on my second Phantom when it came out of the box and found 3 were loose and needed a little tightening.2 . Get spare props and if you plan on shooting video , get the carbon fiber props and balance them with a prop balancer . i have a rubber isolated camera mount as well , but I do n't think it 's necessary for shooting Jello free video . There is zero jello when shooting 1080/60 with balance carbon fiber props and no rubber isolated camera mounts . While the isolated camera mount is added insurance , it can cause problems . On one flight , one of the rubber bushings for the camera mount became detached and when I landed , the GoPro came out of the mount all together resulting in a scratched the lens . Here is a video I shot with balanced graphite props and no camera isolation mounts.3 Besides paying attention to trees , wind , and wires when flying pay attention to those props when spinning . I got a pretty good cut when I reached for the Phantom and caught my finger turning blade.4 . When I first got my Phantom , I flew it on a regular basis , weather permitting . With practice , I became pretty comfortable flying it . Then I did n't fly it for about two months . I quickly found I had lost my skills and promptly flew it into a tree . My first and only crash . The blades got banged up , but overall , the Phantom came out of the crash in good shape . If you have n't flown for a while , get yourself familiar with the Phantom in an open area until your skills come back.5 . The prop balancer I use has two powerful magnets to hold the shaft in place . Keep the prop balancer away from the Phantom . We recently moved to a new house , so I packed the prop balancer with the Phantom quad copter . Unfortunately , the magnet was too close to the compass and I had a compass error problem I needed to resolve . Keep magnets away from the compass unless you want to spend a lot of time getting the compass right again.6 . Get at least two backup batteries . Ten minutes of flight is n't very long before landing again . The spare batteries get you back in the air quickly . I have four batteries and also bring along a portable battery charger if I plan on flying for any length of time.7 . If you are into performance flying , you wo n't want the added weight of the prop guard . I 'm into filming more than performance flying so I use a prop guard for several reasons . After cutting my finger , I do n't want to cut anybody or anything with those props . The prop guard helps eliminate this possibility . The prop guard also makes the Phantom more visible when flying . I painted the two front prop guards red , so I could more easily tell front from back when the Phantom is flying high in the sky . Works great . I also recently added a very bright light over the battery cover . This combined with the red prop guard make it easy to keep the Phantom oriented the way you want it.8 . Join Phantom Pilots : [ ... ] It is an online group of folks who fly Phantom Quadcopters . It 's a friendly group and they have good tips for both novice more experienced flyers , alike.9 . Keep a common sense pre-flight check list and go over it before every flight . Check screws , make sure batteries are charged , check blade tightness , and familiarize yourself with the flight controls making sure you are in GPS mode , if that 's how you intend to fly . Also keep a list of what the meaning of the light signals are , to make sure the CPU , GPS , and compass are working properly.10 . If you are filming , bring a back up battery for the GoPro . The GoPro3 Black edition camera runs down batteries quickly , and I have been stuck with a dead camera and a Phantom ready to fly.Why two Phantoms ? I ended up getting a second Phantom for several reasons . The price dropped $ 200 from the time I purchased my first one in January , which helped make my decision . The main reason I purchased a second Phantom was I have had some down time with my first one . From updating software issues to compass issues . I missed several video opportunities because of this down time , so I figured having two would insure at least one Phantom is up and running .	1
I 've been flying R/C planes for years , and the transition to this was very easy.I flew it the first time with no prior practice or instruction . I just took it easy , and got a feel for things.Now I 'm very comfortable using it in GPS mode , and often turn that off so I can use it to get great vid 's & # 34 ; coasting & # 34 ; along at specific heights , which creates cinematic effects you ca n't get with a plane.I use a Hero 3 Black edition , and rubber grommet & carbon fiber mount to reduce vibration ( Jello ) in the vids.So far I 've had no issues with it . My only complaint is the price dropped close to $ 200 not even 3 weeks after I bought it .	1
No need to write anything . This is invention and perfect for everyone . I recommend anyone who does not know anything for the RC control as well .	1
When you get the Phantom you wont get the home lock IOC features `` to help you get used to the controls '' is nothing more than a way to get users to register with their website ! You must register to use the Naza software in order to turn on the extra features that should be turned on from the start . Even though forced registration was required to get the Phantom working as it is advertised as or to be able to make tweaks to the bird , it is well worth it ! I 've flown CP helis and also FP helis which are a lot harder to fly than a quad as it is inherently stable . This little guy is ultra stable as I 've only had it a day and have only flown it in my living room which flew quit well or at least hovered quit well . I had to modify the camera base to fit my Swann HD Camera but it holds my camera very well and I balanced my props before I ever powered the Phantom on and it paid off as my video looks quite stable with no jello effect that I notice.I 'm not happy about the required registration but I 'm quite happy with the quad and plan on doing lots of videos with it . If you can afford it , buy it ! But if you want IOC home lock flight controls be aware you must register with their website to use the Naza software as I hit cancel to register or log in and the program closed ! ! ! Still ... ..JUST BUY IT ! ! ! LOTS OF FUN ... .Danny	1
I 'm relatively new to R/C flying , having only flown two other quadcopters . The DJI Phantom is easy to use , serves as a fantastic aerial photo/video platform and has some high-end features that significantly improve ease-of-use and safety . I think it 's fantastic that this quadcopter can _automatically_ fly back to the point from which it took off if it loses connectivity with the transmitter.Before purchasing the DJI Phantom , I purchased a used Ar.Drone Parrot ( v1 ) and a Blade MQX . The Ar.Drone was fun to fly , but the lack of tactile controls ( it uses an iPhone ) made it difficult to fly , especially in bright daylight when I could n't see the screen of my phone . The Blade MQX , however , was very easy to fly and served as a fantastic training platform . I upgraded to the Phantom in order to have a platform with extended range that could also support First-Person View ( FPV ) flying with additional equipment.I was able to open the box and have this quadcopter flying in less than an hour . Online video tutorials provided by DJI were very helpful.One word of caution and my only 'complaint ' , the smart electronics that interact with the on-board GPS , Compass and inertial momentum sensors may require calibration from time to time . This is an easy to follow process , but it requires software that only runs on Windows today . I use a Mac and had to install a Windows 7 virtual machine on my macbook using VirtualBox in order to get the software to work .	1
This will help revolutionize the aerial photography business .	1
Product arrived on time , package very good . This quad is the bomb ! It flys very well and love the GPS naza system on it . Flown twice already in a good breeze and it stood its ground with no problem . It is build solid , would recommend you get one at the price it 's selling for , because this quad is worth more	1
I actually had a propeller fly off because of a loose nut ( check everything before a flight ! ) but despite that and the fact that it crashed about 300ft easily , there was very minimal damage done.This is a great little drone.. They dropped the price as the new model is due out soon ; but at $ 479 , this drone is a steal ...	1
My wife and sons gave my first quadcopter to me 7 years ago- The X-UFO was a primitive toy by today 's standards , but I was immediately hooked- I 've had several machines since then trying to satiate my my addiction , and this Fathers Day , my wife and boys surprised me with the DJI Phantom- It 's an amazing machine ! And for $ 679 , a complete RTF package with GPS and IOC was unobtainable until now-This item is successfully marketed to photographers and videographers because the `` brains '' really work , and make it a very functional ( and affordable ) aerial platform right out of the box- I 've flown only one LIPO ( 10+ minutes ) , but I can already tell the Phantom is all it 's cracked up to be-One last thing- While it 's a blast to fly , it 's not a toy , and should be operated with extreme caution and respect by a responsible adult- Think , `` flying grass trimmer '' .	1
I can vouch for all the positive things that 's been said about the phantom . Fun to fly . Great for aerial photo/video . So nothing to add there . My comments after having used the dji:1 . Battery spec is way optimistic . Though rated for 15 minutes , my copter gave low battery warning light at 9:30 . At 10:30 , it self landed due to low charge . Even the phantom 2 and it 's larger battery , users are reporting 15 min flight , vs. spec of 25 min . Best bet is set a timer for 9 min at launch2 . It 's not an IF but WHEN you will crash . It 's part of the learning curve , partly because you ca n't tell from a distance which is the front and back of the craft . But do n't worry . If you crash and damage parts , all the parts - legs , props , body , etc are cheaply user replaceable . Do get the prop guards . The greatest danger is flying over water . Check YouTube . It happens a lot . If u do over-water flying , consider attaching foam pontoons to the legs.3 . Do the firmware upgrade . Unfortunately you have to have Windows 8 to do this . Hopefully dji will come out with a Mac version.4 . Perhaps the biggest downside is DJI tech support , or lack thereof . I wrote them a tech question via their website and never got a reply . Best resource is forum discussion boards.Happy flying	1
Purchased unit , downloaded NAZA v2.12 and the current firmware for the helicopter . It came with v 3.0 , and I updated to 3.14 . Then followed the instructions on DJI 's website to calibrate the compass and for flying instructions.Problem is the motor will not start . The drone recognizes the remote whenever I shut it off or turn it on . Researching `` dji phantom 3.14 firmware motor '' on the internet lists others with similar problems.Now I have an expensive paperweight that I ca n't fly.I 'll update the review with any progress as I research solutions. -- -- -- -- Update . Found a backdoor to restoring the original firmware and now it works . However if I try to update it again , the motors fail . Not happy.Backdoor procedure requires Naza software available from DJI 's support web siteClick on `` no updates '' next to firmware , type `` door '' , enter `` test '' for username and `` 125 '' for password -- -- -- -- -Update : I had the same issue with more recent firmware 3.16 , however re downloading the default parameters from DJI 's website , and performing the compass and IMU calibration , put me back in business . The quadcopter rocks ! Anyone purchasing the unit should go to DJI Phantom 's website and run through the tutorials , prior to flying .	1
I have n't bought a new screen for our current computer in many years . This ViewSonic monitor has shows crisp detail . Could n't be happier with the performance of it . It was very easy to set up .	1
I bought this keyboard at the same time I bought the tablet and I absolutely love it . I think it is a must have !	1
I just bought a netbook Acer with ws 8 and 500 GB , the value in special offer : $ 500 . I have not used but ipad for last 3 years . Its time to chance . I hope next generation netbooks will be smaller and cheaper .	1
Make sure you install all the updates and flash the Lappy with the newest bios from Acer 's website . The bios fixes the fan issue and the updates make the SSD Scream .	1
It is so cheap that I bought for my friend and she said it was great . One thing is that the fan is little noisy .	1
this is an excellent product for Samsung galaxy tab 2 , - no reduction to the touch capability- no bluer-easy to clean-stick to the screen perfectly.you have to pay attention when installing it , do not let any dust particle stay on screen , hover there is a duct tape included to remove if any.excellent product i recommend it .	1
The best screen protector . Love the brand , they are strong and easy to apply .	1
Works great , no air bubbles and easy to clean . I would recommend this if a matte finish is what you desire .	1
My grandson loves his leapfrog and his only 3 yrs old . It looks like his been using it for years .	1
Great product ! works incredibly with my paper white soft to the touch and snug fit . I love this product , i would recommend it .	1
Great for my new Paperwhite . The only thing I 'd add would be some type of elastic so when I open it fully my hand can rest easy in the elastic band area ( which I love ) but some elastic to keep the device open would be a great addition .	1
This case is easy to use . It provides great protection , and I like the looks of the product . The back flips around and has a strap to help hold the Kindle in one hand securely . It is not bulky and surprisingly lightweight .	1
Good cover . Fits well . Covers my Nexus 7 well . The device does wake up when the cover is opened . So far , it is the best cover for Nexus 7 I have seen .	1
I have this shell/stand , as well as the KHOMO Black PU Leather 360 Degree Rotating Bluetooth Keyboard Case Cover Stand ( B00A8NP1FSboth bought here from Amazon . Both work well , but I thought that the KHOMO was ( a ) a bit too bulky for me and ( b ) I realized that I do n't like cases where you have to insert your tablet into a `` pouch-like '' holder ; I do however carry the keyboard with me to use separately ( although , honestly I am becoming pretty adept at just using the Nexus 10 's onscreen keyboard ) . I 've been using the MoKo slim shell stand case for a little over a month now ; it is very light weight , and the sleep/awake functions of the magnets work well for me . I liked the color availability and like this `` purple '' color ( it 's really more of a deep lavender . I dropped 1 star for two reasons : ( a ) the fabric that rests against the screen of the Nexus 10 leaves `` streaks '' along the fold lines ; they are n't in any way permanent & the cover is not scratching the screen ; it just deposits `` dust '' that has to be wiped away ; hopefully this will stop after the cover loses its newness ; and ( b ) sometimes it takes a bit of fiddling to get the 'stand ' part folded & tucked just right for a solid stand ( while I do n't want an iPad , I am envious of the nicely integrated case/keyboard combo that I just have been unable to find for Android/Nexus tablets ) . All in all , I 'm very happy with it .	1
If the Asus shipped the Nexus 7 2nd generation tablet with a case , this would probably be it . When the advertisement says `` Ultra Thin '' this is no exaggeration . It is as thin as a case could be for my Nexus . The hardback provides excellent protection and the front cover opens , closes and folds with excellent functionality . The magnetic closure keeps the case closed firmly and the sleep/wake magnet works perfectly . I own two of these tablets and have the i-Blason premium leather stand/case cover on the other . I gave it an excellent rating as well for I think the quality of each is about the same . They each have their own desirable and unique characteristics . I find the i-Blason best for the office . It is thicker because the tablet slides in and out and it also has some compartments and a stylus holder . I find the MoKu case better for traveling because it takes up very little room in my briefcase while offering excellent protection if it gets jostled around . In short , I think you ca n't go wrong by using this case with your Nexus 7 2nd generation . I find absolutely no negatives to report .	1
This case protects my nexus 7 ( 2013 ) with zero issues . I like how it not only has the sleep/wake feature but they also put a magnet on the very edge so it will keep the cover closed without any snaps or straps .	1
The lining that covers the screen is soft , but it would have been nice had it been a bit softer.Closing the cover consistently puts it into sleep mode , but , occasionally , opening the cover does not wake it up . It seems to be related to the speed at which the cover is opened ( seems to work consistently if you open it quickly , but it could be something about the strength of the magnet in the cover or it could be an issue with the Nexus 7 ( 2nd generation ) . In any event , it 's not really an issue as it works most of the time.In the reviews for its predecessor ( cover for the 1st generation Nexus 7 ) , there were some complaints that the magnetic & # 34 ; clasp & # 34 ; that holds the cover closed seemed to scratch the screen a little . There is a small metal piece on the edge of the cover that wraps around the edge - so that it 's a small flat metal piece on both sides . Although it lines up with the small magnets attached to the back cover , I can see how a little lateral pressure ( from handling it or carrying it in a hand or a bag ) could cause the metal piece on the cover to come into contact with the glass . To help avoid any potential damage , I put two layers of & # 34 ; invisible & # 34 ; tape on the inside metal piece on the cover that could , potentially , touch the screen . It was fairly cheap , thin tape ( not the name brand ) and it was fairly easy to tear/cut off neatly , so that it only covered the inside surface of the metal piece ( the part that might be able to come into contact with the screen ) . I think it will provide adequate protection and it 's virtually invisible.It 's a great , thin , lightweight ( front and back ) cover for the Nexus 7 2nd generation . All the openings line up well and the folding cover seems very much like the iPad smart cover ( which I think is a beautiful piece of design/engineering ) . It 's quite handy , but it does only provide one angle.All in all , a very nice , slim , lightweight cover for the Nexus 7 2nd generation . It would be hard to beat it for the price .	1
The case fits my G1 Nexus7 perfectly . The magnetic clasp is just strong enough . The auto on and off feature works as advertised . I would buy this brand again .	1
I 'm very happy with the case . It fits on my Nexus 2013 great . Case seems of good quality , does n't feel cheap and offers moderate protection . A huge bonus that I found out after buying it is that it allows wireless charging to the Nexus . I have a Nokia wireless charging pad ( search for it on amazon ) and it allows wireless charging with the case on the Nexus , huge bonus to me . Enjoy .	1
This case fits nice and is easy to put on and take off . The only downside is the cover part is a bit flimsy , but it still supports the tablet fine when folded into the triangle support .	1
I 've been using it for a few months now and it has held up well . The magnet clasp is nice . The folding stand can be finicky but it is manageable . I got it in blue , the color in the photo is pretty accurate . I would recommend this case .	1
Well constructed.Properly fits thghtly around the Nexus 10.Prompt delivery.Cut outs for Power , HDMI , Audio and Camera are all well placed and non blocking.The fold back cover to make a stand is clever and works reat for watching any Horzontal type material ( Movies , videos etc ) .Very pleased with the acquisition.The only shortfall I found was that there was no Cutout for the POGO magnetic connect carging cable if you happen to have one . I created my own cut out for that .	1
This is a great case . I usually prefer only Speck cases ( for my iPhone ) but this is a cute , flowery colorful case that also protect my Nexus.I like it and I would recommend this to others . It flips open easily , the magnet seems strong	1
Fits rightturn screen on/off function works welltakes small bumps and bruises without showingeasy to cleanCould n't ask for more at this price .	1
Seems to give good protection . Can still charge wirelessly and read NFC tags while wearing the case . Sometimes will not stay up on stand if it gets touched , but overall pretty good .	1
Great case for the size and price . It is by no means a & # 34 ; Drop it down the stairs & # 34 ; kind of case but it works wonders for keeping your device safe while in a backpack or for being bumped off of the desk or other short drops like that . The stand is very useful and simple . I also love the wake/sleep function . Once you open the case , it wakes the device and when you close the case , it turns the screen off.Over all great case . Not extreme protection but amazing for the weight and price.Would Highly Recommend	1
My MoKo case for my Nexus 7 ( 2013 version ) was & # 34 ; broken on delivery. & # 34 ; It appears that the envelope that contained the case was crushed during shipping.Why did I rate this case with 5 stars ? Customer service - Plain and simple ... The seller immediately shipped a new case to me with no questions asked . Their quick response to my email questions earned them 5 stars.MoKo Case review : The plastic back seems to fit well with no issues . The magnetic cover turns on and off the Nexus without issues . Looks like a great case to protect my Nexus 7 in my pack .	1
Over all , this is a really good case , considering the price . It 's just like the description says : slim , lightweight , and for the most part convenient . It has a magnetic catch to keep the case closed . The Nexus 7 does indeed go in and out of sleep mode when you close/open the case . The hinged cover does allow you to stand it up , and as long as you 're on a stable surface , it works just fine . I do n't think this case will last a long time if you 're going to toss it in a crowded book bag/briefcase , so someone who 's looking to `` abuse '' the case a bit might want to look for other , more durable options . I 'm pretty gentle with my technology , so I am fine with its construction.At any rate , I am satisfied with the purchase , and would n't mind suggesting that others look into purchasing this for their Nexus 7 , especially considering the price .	1
I really like this case . It is slim , efficient and rugged . It protects my Nexus 7 and still lets me carry it in my back pocket . The front cover folds up to create the easel stand for landscape viewing . There is no portrait option , but I never need to stand the tablet in that orientation . Well worth the money .	1
Magnet latch holds it up well . Automatically turns the Nexus on/off when the cover is open/closed . Adds very little bulk .	1
Good quality . Nice feel . Nice view . Magnetic lock is very good . When you close the cover , Nexus locks and turn the screen off . When you open the cover , Nexus behaves as you pressed the button .	1
works great , also serves as an stand . Great purchase for the price , fits perfectly with the 2n gen nexus 7 , no regrets !	1
I had been looking for a Speck brand case for my 2013 Nexus 7 , but could n't find one that had everything . Slim fit , magnetic lock and auto-on , full screen access , etc . Everything in my local stores either covered part of the bezels , or was bulky or had those awful strips of elastic for the corners that lets the tablet slide around . That wo n't work for me because I use swipe actions on every side of the screen . I found this at Amazon , and figured $ 13 bucks would be worth the risk . I 'm so glad I ordered ! I thought maybe it would look or feel cheap compared to a Speck - but it compares very nicely ! As in , maybe they 're made in the same factory and just re-branded ? The auto-on magnets work like a charm , and the metal strip that activates them ( which carries the MoKo logo ) never actually touches the screen . It 's the same faux-leather you see on almost all these kinds of cases , but certainly pulls off a distinguished look . The inside material that protects the screen is supple and soft . There 's plenty of clearance for all ports , speaker grills , and power/volume button access . The tri-fold front works as pictured , using magnets to lock the flap into place - brilliant ! If I had to search for something to complain about , I guess I could say that there 's a little & # 34 ; case creak & # 34 ; if you put pressure on the long edge of the case that holds the magnets , up near where it cuts out for the access to the volume rocker . But that 's being hyper-critical and does n't rise to the level of anything I have n't experienced with other cases on different devices . In short - I feel as though I stumbled upon the best value/performance case I could have for my Nexus 7 . Bonus : I picked 2-day delivery , but actually got it the next day ! Score !	1
Pretty standard tablet case that gets the job done without issues . It has the magnetic connector to the front of the tablet and folds back to stand at a 45 degree angle . One note : with an older case that I had , it required you to fold it in a certain way for it to stay in place , but with this one , you just need the magnets to connect to form the triangle at the basis and it works fine .	1
Works excellently as a case . I love how the magnets turn the display off and on . Mediocre stand , it 's often unfolds itself . Also , the cover leaves some light smudges on the screen where they touch . Much better than the flimsy rubbber OEM case available at launch .	1
It feels perfectly and has a low profile I would recommend this to anyone owning a Nexus 7 tablet ( new gen ) . It is also thin enough to allow wireless charging .	1
I really like this case . It fits my new Second Generation Nexus 7 ( 2013 ) perfectly without adding bulk . The auto on/off feature works perfectly & all the cutouts for cameras , charging , volume , speakers & power are exactly where they should be . It is so well designed , I hardly notice it 's there.The stand ( fold-back cover ) works well too .	1
Great case for the price . It turns the screen on and off when opened and closed . Would recommend to a friend .	1
My daughter loves the case . It is n't as vibrant as the picture , but it is pretty close . Otherwise it 's great . No problems so far .	1
Worked out very well . Fits very tight and is very slim . I feel like it is n't going to hold up in the long run , after two months is already starting to get worn . But at 10 bucks or even less I 'll be buying another .	1
I wanted a cover : * to protect the tablet 's screen* and it 's back* and not add too much bulk to it 's compact design* and not look too tacky ( being faux-leather ) * and something that was inexpensiveThis cover fit right in . It 's just what I was looking for .	1
Great cover . Can put it on either side . Great premium feeling material . Very durable and looks great . Love the magnetic catches .	1
My wife got a new Nexus from Santa this year and I knew she would not want a plain old boring black cover . This was my first Moko case as we have had great luck with Poetic products in the past . I have to say , I think I like this design a bit better - but both are close ( I have the Poetic for mine ) . I can not think of a single area of improvement - fit is flawless , buttons are perfectly accessible and the color/style was a hit with my wife . Well done Moko .	1
I bought this case when another by a different manufacturer failed within 30 days . I have used it daily for 3 months , even while traveling . It has stood up very well . Looks and functions perfectly.Pros : extreme thin profile , easy to install and remove , nice texture and feel , adds no weight , 2 landscape viewing positions for video and typing.Cons : none	1
This is a useful protective case and it does work to keep the tablet upright horizontally . But it does n't swivel to hold it up vertically , which can be annoying at times ( you can try to angle the case behind it do that , but it does n't work very well . The built in magnet feature is nice - the tablet knows when the case is opened and closed and turns on/off accordingly . It 's sturdy and useful . My only complaint is that it only holds the tablet up in one orientation . Otherwise , it 's a good case .	1
Good quality and it does everything I need it to in protecting my new Nexus 7 ( 2013 ) device . I own several of this brand 's cases for various devices .	1
Bougth 2 of these for Nexus 7s i got for my boys . I like the hard plastic back and sides , and the folding top that has a magnetic clasp to keep it closed . It wakes/sleeps the device when opened/closed . I have n't noticed any hinderance to sound , buttons , etc .	1
Protects the Nexus 7 well . Nice magnetic closure . It folds easily behind the tablet . I have not tried to fold the cover to prop the unit up . The cover is fairly stiff and does n't feel like it will fold easily .	1
Fits the Nexus 7 ( 2013 ) perfectly . The case material is substantial and feels good to the touch . Since I just bought it and used it for about 2 weeks , I do n't know how durable it will prove to be .	1
This case works well . The triangle formed with the cover could hold a bit better then I would give 5 stars .	1
I love Griffin product on overall , All product from this company design to matched & get high quality apple accessory	1
It 's solid , very well built . I like the coiled cable so it would n't break easily like the long one came from Apple . However , it 's a little short on this one as others mentioned . Twice as long would be nice . 4 ' is a little misleading without mentioning how long it 's really is in regular form	1
I bought this to protect an Android tablet that I bought for my daughter for Christmas . It fits perfectly and holds the tablet securely . It does take a bit of effort to remove that tablet , but I 'd prefer that to it falling out so that 's not really a complaint . My daughter LOVED the sky blue color . A++	1
Product is nice and works properly and for the price was a good deal and well worth it 's price for the quality that it serves .	1
this was purchased as a gift . I did not hear any complaints and the last time I saw it , it was being used . So I think it was a good buy .	1
my grand daughter loves it . just what she wanted . helps hold up the tablet so she doesnt have to hold it .	1
I bought a pair because they disappear on your work cubical desk . The sound quality for this physical size and price point is insane . They are mono devices , so if you want to have stereo you have to buy a bluetooth audio receiver/adapter to output L/R to each BEM cube.For just about $ 100 you can be in sonic heaven .	1
The product is good but it doesnt fit snug if you have a extended battery grip , they should really consider making a cover for both camera and extended battery grip .	1
looks like a small laptop bag.i had my tablet stolen . but received a small laptop from work ( maybe sized 10 & # 34 ; laptop ) the laptop luckily fits into the case , but it 's snug . the laptop itself does n't fit in the divided separate area but that 's okay because it still fits in the main area .	1
I have fallen in love with this produce.Its is quality made perfect color ( looks just like the picture ) .I do n't have to worry about my tablet getting broken or cracked unless it is sat on .	1
Family loves these things to hold all their new tablets and associated equipment . They are handy , well padded , and very convenient.every time someone in the family sees one , they want one . We found there is room for a foldable ZAGG keyboard and charging equipment of the tablet . No quality problems and so far we are on 5 of these . All look great after a year or so of abuse .	1
I do like the case itself , its very nice . But the drop on the strap is too short for my taste . I wish the drop on the strap had been included in the product dimensions on the catalog page . Looking for a new ( longer ) strap to use with it .	1
This is a great product . It 's well made , has a lot of space for the tablet as well as accessories and other essentials . Very pleased with it !	1
The BEST protective case available ! ! ! It is pricey , but it is worth the expense . It protects the Kindle Fire HD 7 & # 34 ; like no other product on the market .	1
I have purchased three Kindles and have purchased this protective case for all of them . Its a little pricey , but well worth it . The kindles were purchased for two boys , one of whom is specials needs . They protect them completely and do not affect operation at all .	1
This case is perfect for my sticky finger kids . The cases cover the entire Kindle completely so I can easily wipe them down when they get nasty.The charger port is easy to open and plug in but because of what is made out of my son might eventually rip it off ( soft rubber type material ) , but if you are buying just to keep the sticky fingers off the machine that should n't make a big difference .	1
I got this for my Kindle Fire HD 7 & # 34 ; . I own a couple OtterBox items and knew I could n't go wrong . It went on easily with no problems and the built-in touch screen operates smoothly . I like the built in stand because it is separate from the the actual Kindle case and definitely sturdy . I would recommend this case if you have a Kindle Fire HD 7 & # 34 ; and want to make sure it is well protected .	1
Perfect protection for my new kindle . I love the built in stand and screen protector . It makes it look like a beefy tablet in a good way .	1
I let my 9 , 5 , and 1.5 year old children play with my kindle . I personally hate the thickness of the protector and screen , but that is part of what makes this so safe . I have stopped my toddler from using a number of different writing utensils on it ( broken pencils , pens , random pointed stick things ) , the screen protector has a few permanent scratches , but the kindle itself is in perfect shape.I have noticed on two occasions some water inside the case near the camera holes , I took the case off and dried everything off before putting it back on . It naturally is n't completely waterproof , since the speakers and camera are uncovered , but it 's much safer in the otterbox than out .	1
I 'd give it 10 stars if they were available ! Okay , so the instructions are severely lacking and confusing , but once you have installed one OtterBox , you can install all ! I had purchased an OtterBox for my Nook locally and the salesman put it on for me hoping I 'd purchase it . It worked ~ I did ! I was walking through my living room that very night and fell . My Nook went flying ! But the OtterBox protected it from any damage ! After that , I decided all my devices would be protected by OtterBox ! OtterBox makes the device a little heavier to hold , but knowing it 's protected from slips , trips , falls and spills makes the extra weight worth while ! The stand , which doubles as a screen cover ( making a complete hard shell case ) , is a fantastic feature and allows you to place your device at multiple angles for hands free viewing ! OtterBox is the BEST !	1
Fourth time 's a charm ... I 've been struggling to find the perfect Kindle cover . My criteria are protection , aesthetics , bulk and usability . OttorBox meets or exceeds most of them . It certainly protects well , as do all their products , though it does take a bit to figure out how to take it apart the first time you use it . It 's blocky , but not awful to look at , though with the detachable stand it gets awful thick . I kept that for watching movies and whatnot , but doubt I 'll use it much . Certainly I wo n't leave it attached all the time . Useability-wise , the speakers are uncovered and all the buttons and ports are readily accessible . The built in cover lets plenty of light through . The only common feature not found with other covers is the auto sleep/wake function , but I really do n't mind pushing the on/off button instead . Of the four covers I 've tried ( Verso `` Prologue '' Standing Cover for Kindle Fire HD 8.9 '' , Antique Tan ( will only fit Kindle Fire HD 8.9 '' ) , Marware MicroShell Folio Lightweight Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 7 '' , Black ( only fits Kindle Fire HD 7 '' ) , Acase Kindle Fire HD Case - New Kindle Fire HD 7 Inch Tablet Cover / Kindle Fire HD 7 '' Tablet Premium PU Leather Case with Flip Stand ( BLACK ) and OttorBox ) , this one 's my favorite . Not perfect , but definitely good enough to keep . Now if they 'd only make one for the Kindle Paperwhite 3G too ...	1
Fits and protects . My son can use his Kindle and not cause me to have a fit . Stand in case is great . The kindle never leaves this case at our house .	1
My boy is obsessed with Minecraft ( I think it might be the Lego of this generation ) and we finally gave in an bought him a Kindle for finishing his school year on a good note . One condition I had was that we would not buy him one without a tough case because he is walking-talking dynamo of dirt and destruction.I am happy to say that , some 4mos later , this case has protected his Kindle and it is probably in better condition than mine . Docking one star because the price is so high as compared to what it is protecting- it is worth it , but it would be an easier pill to swallow if it was n't ~50 % of the Kindle price .	1
Some time ago I had a Dell Streak 7 for which I purchased an Otter box . Currently I own a Kindle Fire HD . With it I had purchased a Roo Origami case because of its appearance , versatility , and economic price . However , I missed the reassurance of the added protection that the Ottebox Defender offers . So , I was at Radio Shack the other day just looking around . They happened to have the Otterbox Defender case , and I happened to have the money . The sales associate actually put the case on for me , and I walked out with my device fully protected.It is fully protected now from drops and scratches . The back of the case has openings which allow the speakers to be fully exposed . The shield that clips to the front will not turn the device on or off automatically , but the otterbox has very obvious buttons which transmit pressure to the actual buttons on the device . This is important , as one complaint of this new Kindle Fire is that the power button is difficult to find . With this case , locating the power button is no longer an issue . Also , the shield that covers the front has a built in stand which allows you to enjoy the device in portrait as well as landscape mode . It also includes a screen protector.I see only a couple cons , but , for me they are easy to overlook considering the superior protection . The obvious is the added weight and bulk . But , it is kid proof and you can toss it into a bag or pack without fear of any damage . And , do n't worry about dropping it either . In addition to the extra bulk , there is some added glare with the included screen protector . As I mentioned though , these are minor issues . If you want ultimate protection and durability for your device , then I highly recommend this product .	1
otter box is awesome but i first looked to see if balistic and grifin made one but at the time not yet so i got this.it work the great . it no longer feels fragile , ports are easy to get toi would recomend this to anyone who is looking for a case that is going to be good enough to hand off the kindle hd to a child	1
For me , nothing beats an OtterBox for protecting portable electronics . On the one hand the cases add considerable bulk but that 's what it takes to keep it safe from abuse .	1
It makes holding the Kindle more like holding a weighty book but it provides excellent drop protection ! ! And I would n't be afraid if I were to be caught in a sudden downpour at the beach .	1
I am very happy with how secure my daughter 's Kindle Fire HD seems to be in this case . The only downside to me is that we can not tell when it is done charging without turning on the Kindle because the button is completely covered .	1
This no bubble screen protector is great , it is easy to apply . When I applied this protector I did n't have any problems , I did n't have any bubbles . I did n't have to worry about bubbles because I do n't have the patience when screen protector where you peel off and apply on device , I really do suck at doing that . This is great investment for your kindle fire , hd , why not protect your screen with simplicity than difficultly and would give you a headache . Again try you do n't like it then send it back .	1
This screen protector keeps my kindle fire HD from being messed up by finger prints . I would not want to have a Kindle Fire HD and not have a screen protector on it .	1
Wayyy more awesome then replacable ones . Who has time to mess with that ? Good quality , went on easy and I was worrried cause my hands are shakey and I was able to get it on NO PROBLEM !	1
This product works as the manufacturer designed it . I am very happy with this and will use it on any and all devices I have . Easy to install . Those who wrote a negative review about this product are picky beyond sensiblility .	1
Awesome the best there is better than the thin film and easy to take off and clean . Do n't buy the thin film protectors they are a hassle and getting the bubbles out is a hassle .	1
I find this much easier to use than the filmy screen protecters . It 's made of heavier material so it 's easier to place on the device and cleaning is quick and easy with the included microfibre cloth .	1
This item fit the Kindle HD Fire perfectly and had not bubbles . Did not affect screen touch and it is easy to keep clean	1
Easy to install , clean , take off and adjust . Wish I had bought this for my first Ipad . What a cinch .	1
Not one negative thing to say about this item . I used my kindle daily , It gets abused from time to time by kids . Never lets me down !	1
I wanted something to be like a more secure , more customizable version of a consumer router . Ideally I would have gone with IOS but that only comes on the equipment that runs in the thousands . I was able to do everything in the web interface that I wanted , and was able to do it fairly quickly . I wish there were more VPN connections available , but it 's alright . IPSEC is better than PPTP , even if it has the tiny bit of Microsoft protection - remember PPTP is just a tunneling protocol . I am hesitant to make people use the client form of VPN . Eventually I 'll be upgrading to a true Cisco switch , but I think I will be keeping this as a wireless router .	1
this card lets you get great performance from 300-450 watt power suppliesand is totally silent ( no fan ) no heat ( low wattage ) perfect for any HTPC where gaming is not the primary objective	1
Well apparently these ones does n't support XMP out of the box , but when i installed them , the bios detected the correct timings and speed . Worked flawlessly , i 'm very happy . Btw , my motherboard is an Asus P8Z68-V Pro .	1
Works great with Win 8.1 64 bit . Did n't use supplied driver disk . it just worked ! My application is a simple & # 34 ; Dumb & # 34 ; terminal program running a piece of test equipment . The LED 's are great and will really help if problems arise .	1
Works flawlessly compared to the Belkin adapter I replaced it with . Works we 'll on all my old serial port stuff I own .	1
I bought this for a camera I bought here on Amazon the camera is a & # 34 ; Canon 35mm Ti SLR & # 34 ; .Now what I did not know is this shutter release DOES NOT use batteries and how I found that out is when I took it apart.Thank goodness I was able to put it back together without mess it up.With this shutter release you can ( 1 ) hold down the button or ( 2 ) push down the button then slide it forward and it locks the button so you can do something else such as time your exposure , this shutter works on the same principle as the old cable shutter release which you could lock down by turning a small side knob.This shutter is the basic model they do have some which have a digital program so you can set a time and when it counts down to zero the shutter is then released.Either model this basic one one the digital one will do what they are supposed to do and that is for time exposures.Well worth the money	1
The remote shutter was inexpensive and shipped quickly . Always a little camera shake on the tripod and waiting 10 seconds for the timer was not only a pain , but missed some shots . This remote shutter release fixed that problem and I love it . Decent size cable and think it will last a long time .	1
The works perfect on my Rebel just as the ad says . I love it , helps out so much for any type of photography .	1
Simply functions the way it is suppose to and I love how sturdy it is . The plug and cord are up to my quality standards and the shutter button works well when pressed halfway and all the way . Shipped pretty fast too !	1
The seller gets 5 stars for delivering the product earlier than expected and for the product being exactly as described . I was worried at first because some reviews on some of the remotes offered here on Amazon said that the units would not work with their T2i 's . This unit was flawless and if you have common sende you do n't need any instructions to get started out of the box . This unit operates with single or continuous shooting by pressing and holding the button or by sliding the button lock into place . It 's a great buy and it costed me about $ 15 less than the unit offered at Wolf camera by some other off brand manufacturer.A great buy if you have shakey hands or are taking shutter sensitive photos .	1
great accessary at a great price , you can not go wrong , i took them out of the box and put them on , they fit like a glove , just the way i like it	1
I 've wanted a shutter release for quite a while now ! As simple as shutter releases are , there 's not much to mess up , so I opted for the cheaper version generic brand . I do n't regret that a bit . It 's very nice , and with a locking `` shutter button , '' it 's very easy to use . The only con is that the cord is only about 3ft long . I 'd prefer a longer cord , but that 's not hard to fix with an extension if you 've got the mind to .	1
The remote works , and the bulb lock works well too . The only drawback is that it is easy to accidentally push the button too far and trigger the shutter when trying to only focus with a half press of the button .	1
I have the wireless shutter release for Canon T1i , and the one thing that bothered me with it was that the camera only recognizes it for a short while , and then typically hibernates and you need to & # 34 ; wake it up & # 34 ; in order to get it to react to the shutter release . ( some of these settings you can change on your camera ) . What I wanted was a shutter release that no matter how many minutes between snapping pictures , I can just press and it will act as if I am pressing the actual button on the camera , and this does exactly that . Would recommend to anyone looking for a remote shutter release that primarily acts as an extension of the actual button on the camera . The length of cord could be longer for certain functions , but for what I am using it for ( primarily taking long exposures without waiting for the manual second countdown timer to take the photo ) it is perfect .	1
works well , does what it is supposed to do without bells or whistles . Would of given 5 stars but there is a slide that allows you to take rapid shots without having to depress button . This has slid without my intending to do so several times . I am now more careful and it has n't happened in a while .	1
You could easily spend five times as much for a name brand shutter release ; but why would you ? This product has been nothing less than 100 % reliable for me . I have looked into several other products that Neewer has , and they too have been as effective as other higher priced brands ... or better . This is as close to professional grade as anyone needs . Give it a try and simply use the savings to buy even more of their great products .	1
Feels a little cheap in the hand plastic wise , light weight but works great with the T3 ( 1100D canon ) . The cord is long enough for tripod work and the lock option is not touchy at all . I rate this 5-5 they shipped fast and it arrived two days early , no damage to the package and I will be using this as a backup . I would recommend this product for those who wish to use the Canon T3 ( 1100D ) or the T3i cameras .	1
After reading all the reviews i bought this product and it is great . Best price .. Glad i purchased it . Easy to work with and comfortable to hold .	1
I use this with my Zoom H4N attached to a stereo videomic pro , it is essential in my rig , and is amazingly cheap . just make sure it is on tight !	1
This is the perfect add on for my set up . Now I can add all of the items I have to the camera .	1
Great little thing that could . Attach'em all and no shake or bounce . Sturdy , all metal - everything fits no problem .	1
When you are on a mobile shoot on your own , and do n't have a crew to handle lighting and sound , it 's nice to be able to mount your light and mic onto your camera and have them move with you , without the lengthy rearranging process	1
I wanted a small V mount for a relatively compact setup with a small camcorder and handle and this fits the bill quite nicely.The bracket is stout . The metal is much thicker than I expected it would be . There 's virtually no give or flex here and it 's certainly not going to be the weak point in any mounting setup . The hot shoe screw is threaded into the bottom of the mount and it arrived a little loose but it was nothing a few turns of a wrench did n't fix up . It 's plenty tight now and I have no worries about it going anywhere on me now , the extra paranoid could add a dab of thread lock if they really wanted to . It 's also threaded all the way through the mounting plate so you can attach a tripod plate to it for off camera mounting options.The spacing and offset between the shoes is just perfect to fit an LED light panel and small boom mic . Third shoe mount in the middle is a nice touch but I do n't plan on really using it for anything . Shoes themselves are very sturdy and firmly attached with 3 screws each.The whole thing has a very nice powder coat finish and looks quite nice and has a nice sized thumb wheel for locking it down in place.All in all , an excellent value .	1
Handy accessory mount for my Nikon D5100 camera . I use it to mount a video light , a flash , and a shotgun microphone all on one camera . It allows me to be ready for video or still photos in all kinds of lighting conditions . 5 stars because it was just what I wanted and it works for me . I would recommend to anyone looking to make their DSLR more versatile . Bob	1
Perfect for those times when you need to mount a monitor/Ninja 2 , mic , and light but your DSLR only has that one hot shoe mount . What were those manufacturers thinking ? Did n't they realize that DSLRs were going to be able to converted into digital cinema monsters ? Ah that 's right & # 8230 ; they 're still still cameras first & # 8230 ; then video . Anyway , this mount is AWESOME ! Keep in mind a few things:1 ) Make sure it 's mounted correctly to your hot shoe or it 'll throw off the balance of the camera . I use a Glidecam HD-4000 with my 5D Mark 3 and the SLIGHTEST weight difference can throw off that glass-like look immediately . Even if you do n't use a Glidecam/Steadicam/SmoothOutYourHandheldVideocam , it has the capability of mounting off center which is just kind of annoying and makes me want to punch things.2 ) These are COLD shoes & # 8230 ; it 's the truth . This mount ran out on our wedding 3 months ago and it has n't returned my texts , calls , or snapchats . These will not interact with your camera ( like a flash ) and wo n't power your devices ( like a mic or the like ) .3 ) The middle shoe is limited in what you can put there since it 's so small ( insert 'that 's what she said ' here ) . I ca n't mount my LED light or monitor , but my Rode VMP fits perfectly . It mounts perfectly every time . Yup & # 8230 ; I went there.Overall , it 's a great mount . Sturdy , pretty light , and seems like it could tough out a fight with Mike Tyson & # 8230 ; well & # 8230 ; maybe his chihuahua .	1
My third ZAGG keyboard product . It 's excellent . Very comfortable key size and spacing ( given tablet constraints ) , soft keyboard lighting , holds the tablet well and ata good angle . Nothing I would change about it . Terrific product .	1
I use this Zagg PROfolio ( not backlit version ) daily and it 's almost two years old and still going strong.The battery charge lasts for about three weeks and I use the iPad for hours every day . It takes about six hours to charge fully , so I just charge it overnight.The keyboard is nicely spaced and easy to adapt to from being used to a full-sized keyboard with a PC.My only complaint is that at certain angles it topples due to the depth of the slot being shallow . This slot could be made deeper but that would result in a case that is thicker . When using on a desk or table it is fine . When sitting in bed I put a pillow in front of me like a desk and can arrange the angle so it does not topple . It topples when sitting and using my legs as the surface.Sometimes it does not lock automatically when I close it so I have to hit the lock button manually.Despite these couple of concerns I remain really happy with it and rate it 5 stars = I Love It .	1
This Zaggkeys has good built quality . The case is top notch , and the key does not feel cramped . The lights on the keys are adjustable to different colors and battery is pretty decent.My two issues with this : - No adjustable angle- No portrait mode available.I wish it was designed like the Belkin where the keyboard can actually be folded down so you can at least hold the iPad in portrait mode .	1
We bought this for my Mom to use with her new iPad . It fits and functions great . She loves the freedom to use it like a laptop - the keyboard is very comfortable and easy to use ( more so than the on-screen keyboard ) .	1
i had others that did not last and this case cost more than others but is good and will last	1
My dog chewed up my Kensington Keyfolio pro 2 case . I wanted something with a backlit keyboard so I went with this Zagg . While it is a high priced case it is worth it if you need or want a back lit key board . The keyboard works great in the dark and you can adjust the brightness level and color of the light . The case is also much thinner than my previous case . It is lighter and packs easier . The case holds the ipad securely .	1
Pros- Really nice hard case , - it is n't heavy- battery lasts long enough- Bluetooth connects easily- really nice backlight featureCons- you 'll need a screen protector ... ( b/c your screen will be marked with the keys and a horizontal line from the base ) Even with the Cons , I 'm happy with this purchase so I still give 5 stars .	1
I replaced an early Zagg Keyboard/Case with this one and it 's a vast improvement . The lighted keys work great in dark environments and it 's kind of cool to be able to change the color at will . The wave guide behind the speaker directs the sound to the front which is new and works great . The keys do n't pop up anymore and the letters on the keys will no longer wear off . This is a great keyboard . The only issue is that it 's a poor case when just standing and trying to use the iPad freehand . But I have a different case for when I 'm carrying it around . But for a keyboard case it 's the top of the line !	1
It works fine with a WD 500GB black 7200rpm SATA drive . USB3.0 is screaming fast so large transfers are quick . The case is thin aluminum and end caps are plastic with small screws to hold them on . Came with USB cable , protective pouch , and screwdriver .	1
nice portable go to speaker with with just enough sound to fill a moderate size room . Instant dance party for my kids !	1
Really nice blue tooth speaker . First bought 2:1 speakers with first CD burner . First speakers for second computer the needed their own power ! Back in the 20th century . Speakers still going ... hooked up to # 3 desktop at home . Expect same kind of value and performance from Oontz . Use it with Samsung tab for music enjoyment .	1
Source : iPod Touch 5th GenProsDetailed highs , solid mids for voice or dialogueSlightly smaller grill size than Oontz Angle and better overall sound imaging and fuller bassOnly $ 10 more than Oontz Angle at $ 49Sibilance is very minimal ( hissing sound when there is no music played ) ConsStatic popping and crackling on pairing but does n't crackle or pop when switching between sources or between songsBox inside was torn and looked like it had already been opened and used . I did not buy a refurb as far as I know ( ordered from Amazon website ) Comes with black felt carry bag . I just received my Oontz Speaker and I could n't be more happy . The sound stage is n't very big because the speaker is so tiny but it packs a punch . It will fill a small to medium sized bedroom with sound . In my opinion the Oontz sounds much better than the Oontz Angle . The mni-USB plug is the same type of plug found on Playstation 3 controllers as well as DSLR 's like the Nikon D40 and many Canon Camorders.I feel the Oontz is a good speaker for the money . It is small , lightweight , and provides a good sound quality .	1
Good sounds from a little thing . Did n't expect it . I am impressed . I use this any chance I get . BBQ 's , washing the car in the driveway , watching movies on my tablet . It 's great , go buy now .	1
I like its design , light weight , easy portability , and price . For its size , it packs quite a bit of sound , surprising everyone who heard the sound that came out of it.I used it at a beach BBQ party where it was noisy with lots of people on the beach and this little speaker delivered good clarity and excellent volume . My friends were amazed at its power and sound quality .	1
Overall sounds like a big band . Occasionally there is a little static , but most of the resulting melodies are clear and fantastically distinctive .	1
I have purchased too many bluetooth mini speakers only to be disappointed with either sound , longevity of the product of design flaws that lead to them breaking early on.The speaker is by far the BEST ! ! This includes others that are much more money and some that are less . We took this with us on a trip and it was light , easy to pack , and even assisted us to give a small seminar without any other amplification . Just an overall winner .	1
Ok so when I saw this I was really skeptical , even with all of the good reviews . I was n't sure that this little angled speaker could put out decent sound ... BUT IT DOES ! it does n't sound tinny or weak ... .and holds up to louder volumes and does n't distort when you think it will.The first day I got it , i was supposed to do a workout class in a room with a 70 '' TV . Unfortunately someone else booked the same room and had 25 people in there for a workshop ... .so i moved my little workout group of 8 to another room without a TV . I hooked this up to my computer and played the workout DVD ( Insanity ! ) where the instructor is giving directions AND there 's music playing ... and we had NO PROBLEM hearing all of it . The room was FILLED with sound ! It was the tiny 15 '' screen that was difficult ! Sure it 's not a Bose speaker , or Beats pill , or the new Sol Republic deck ... . But for only $ 39 bucks ... .I can buy FIVE of these little babies for the price of ONE of those . It just so happens that I saw the commercial for the Sol Deck on the same day I ordered this ... and I said to myself : if this does n't perform , I 'll return it . So I kept the packing material just in case . But after that first emergency use ... . I 'm sold . I threw all the packing stuff away and I 'm keeping it ! I can already forsee using it on the beach , poolside , with my laptop when watching a movie , etc.Look ... It 's bluetooth , battery operated , compact , and inexpensive . It 'll even function as a handsfree speaker for your phone ! And did I say it was only $ 39 bucks ? ? ! ! BUY WITH CONFIDENCE . And if you & # 699 ; d rather spend $ 200-300 bucks on a Bose , Beats , or Sol , go ahead and do it if that & # 699 ; s your budget or preference . For me ... $ 39 bucks is GREAT , and I won & # 699 ; t worry if it gets wet or banged around in my computer bag .	1
Honestly , this is the best speaker product that I have ever purchased . I was shopping on Amazon , hoping to find some kind of cheap bluetooth device that I could jam some music in my office to . So I purchased this item , and WOW , I 'm amazed . Not only is it exactly what it describes , but more . The sound quality is really good , and the device is SO LOUD ! It 's like the Beats by Dre , but much cheaper ! In fact , I think louder as well , if not just as loud . Great buy , will buy more !	1
This speaker is quite small and could be placed in many places . The sound is clear and crisp , it 's loud enough but not to where you could blast loud enough for your neighbors to complain . Bass is somewhat low and it 's true that by changing your settings , to put up the bass treble , or at least styles of music , it would improve the sound quality . So as long as you do n't expect this speaker to be what others have said like the $ 300 speakers , then you 'll be fine . Some even compared to the sound to other Bluetooth speakers and said this sounded much better . I have no other comparison , so I ca n't say.One thing is if you plug in the male to male audio jack , it will mess up or freeze your phone at times especially on YouTube . When connected through Bluetooth , you do n't experience that . I 'm not sure how it is with mp3 players , but I 'm sure computers will be fine.For the amount you pay , you really ca n't complain , but , it may not be for everyone , but that 's okay . I also use it to talk to people while driving but , just letting you know either you put that closer to you or you have to speak louder in order for others to head you . I do n't know about others , but , on a single charge , my battery last for a good 15+ hours depending on the volume you leave it on . I tried by playing it really soft all night , then played it on my way to work , on the way back home , and one time left the speaker on without playing any music but , was on . It was still going . So more than 20 hours too but , I ca n't speak for others . So i 'm very impressed with the battery life .	1
I 'm not sure why people are kvetching about the sound quality from this speaker . What exactly were they expecting from a speaker that literally fits in the palm of your hand ? The sound is very crisp and clear . There is n't much in the way of bass . But I did n't expect there to be with a speaker this small . I tested the speaker out with music ( Capital Cities ) and TV ( Grey 's Anatomy ) . Both sounded terrific . I was concerned that the TV sound would be muffled . But the Angle produced sound better than most portable TV sets . I was actually impressed by how loud I could get the sound without distortion . The same can be said listening to Capital Cities . The crisp audio was perfect for that type of music.As an added bonus , once I paired the Angle with my iPad , it automatically re-paired with it once I reactivated Bluetooth on my iPad . Very nice . -- With my older Creative D100 speaker , I 'd have to go to Settings , then Bluetooth , then turn on Bluetooth , then select the speaker from the list to pair it up again .	1
OK folks - this is a battery operated portable speaker . It is not a Bose or a Sony so folks comparing this speaker to those are comparing apples to oranges . The sound is pretty good , it paired with my iPhone 5 perfectly ... .nice to bring outside on the front porch for music ( I do not have a stereo system ) .	1
It does what it should -- it sticks on your screen and protects it . It 's not the full size of the screen because the glass curves at the edges . Get a bumper and the edges are protected -- it 's simple.There 's a little bit of finger drag , but you get that , or worse , with any protector .	1
for their outstanding quality . It was easy to work out , product as advertised . I have n't had the need to buy a replacement yet .	1
The Nexus 4 has a curved screen , so pretty much any of the non-film screen protectors are not going to cover all the glass . That being said , this is cut to the appropriate size . It 's cut to fit exactly over the flat part of the glass , so getting it on there without having one of the sides be slightly off the glass is difficult.I recommend applying from left to right instead of top to bottom . Line the left side of the protector with the left edge of the LCD . It will probably take you more than one try to get it right ( I am experienced with this sort of thing and it took me two tries ) .4 starts is the highest I would rate any non-film screen protector , as by design they can not cover the whole screen due to the curved design of the Nexus 4 screen . This is a good protector.As far as film type screen protectors ( the kind that a kind of like a clear sticker , that you apply with a liquid spray ) I have only tried one and it only got three stars and I only got protector and it was 10 bucks more than this pack of three.There is absolutely no issue with touch sensitivity with this protector . Shows smudges/oils just a little more than the gorilla glass does by itself . Overall I would purchase these again .	1
this is awesome item to have for a big studio . if you have a smaller studio or I should say lower ceiling this item will work okay.it does produce awesome results but with lower ceiling its just does n't fit	1
I had considered one of these for a long while and finally opted to purchase this one . I have only looked it over and not shot under it yet . After all this is a HUGE umbrella and subject to breezes . I prefer mine remain an umbrella and not turn into a sail . It looks well made and the fabric seems like it will do the job for which it was intended . I hope to actually put it to use soon .	1
HUGE not the silly rain fly shown in the picture , What were they thinking , This thing barley fits open in my studio area and that 's a good thing . the fiberglass poles have some flex with has graced me a couple times already .	1
Although the battery lasts a long time on the UV-5RA , this car adapter lets the user keep the radio `` on , '' whenever you go somewhere . In our cars , the cigar lighter/accessory socket turns off when you shut off the ignition . In my case , that means I can keep the radio clipped to the passenger seat belt and when I start up , so does the radio , preset to the frequency where I left it.The coiled cord could be a little longer , that 's why the rating is down a star . The wire that they use is not very flexible , so it takes a good pull on the coil to get to a comfortable length . This might put stress the cord at the radio end , and could potentially pull out the plug from the car 's accessory receptacle if it 's nearly out of reach . There are extension cables but they are bulky and not worth the trouble.Fit and finish are both good , matching the color of the radio 's housing , and sliding correctly into the radio 's battery compartment with no slop or uneven dimensions.The red LED power indicator on the car end is very bright , and at night you may want to turn it away from the driver 's position to avoid mistaking it for an unfastened seatbelt light , the parking brake indicator , or any other idiot lights that happen to be near the cigarette lighter .	1
My case arrived pretty good with the free shipping and the only problem with this case is that the button for turn on/off and the volume button are really terrible but it works find but really hard to press on it , I though it was going to be easy to press on it but is not true . Still good case pretty thin and works find but that 's the only problem with this case is pressing the buttons though I `` RECOMMENDED ''	1
GreatShield cases are a wonderful fit , very tight and do n't allow any dirt or dust to come into the case and damage the outer surface of the iPod . There is microsuede on the inside of the case for a smooth fit and protection . I had a GreatShield case on my 4th Gen iPod and when I upgraded , it still looked brand new and I was able to trade it in for almost half of it 's originial purchase price . Very good value .	1
Android box sets have been very popular in turning dumb TVs into smart TVs . For several of these box sets , their remotes have been sub-par , which is why TaoTronics has come out with the TaoTronics TT-MK001 Mini 2.4G Wireless Flying Mouse Keyboard for Google Android TV to accommodate media centers that lack a good remote.Inside the box is the air remote and a user manual . This device is comparable to a regular remote , 8.1 x 1.2 x 2.6 inches and 5.3 ounces . I like that this looks like an average remote , as it is a familiar look . It has a complete QWERTY keyboard with rubberized keys , an arrow pad and LED indicator on the left side , multimedia keys at the top , and air remote functions at the center.The multimedia keys are labeled , starting from F1 to F12 , but do not function as F1-F12 keys . Under each key is the multimedia symbol ( listed below ) F1 : BrightnessF2 : InternetF3 : SearchF4 : HomeF5 : MailF6 : MusicF7 : RewindF8 : Play/PauseF9 : Fast ForwardF10 : MuteF11 : Volume DownF12 : Volume UpThere are three buttons at the center of the remote : An Android button , Left Click , and Right Click . The Android button ( de ) activates the mouse control functions , which is great when you no longer require the mouse . The left and right click buttons are each self explanatory.The LED indicator will activate when the mouse is activated or when any key is pressed.The back of the remote is removable to show the place of the USB dongle and the three AAA batteries . I like that the USB dongle ( a little bigger than a standard USB ) can be stored inside the remote when it is not in use . I do not like that this uses AAA batteries , as they are an extra expense , and several devices have Ion batteries that can be charged by USB . The back cover was also very difficult to initially remove , as it required significant force when I had to place my fingernails in the slot below the & # 8220 ; Mouse + Keyboard & # 8221 ; text.Specification : & # 8226 ; 2.4GHz DSSS radio transceiver , 10M feet max distance. & # 8226 ; Button life : 1500.00 times & # 8226 ; Dimension : 200x57x25 mm & # 8226 ; Weight : 14g & # 8226 ; System requirements : Windows 98/2000/Me/Vista/NT/XP/7/8 , Android , Linux ( Debian-3.1 , Redhat-9.0 ) & # 8226 ; Power : 3 x AAA battery ( Not included ) Setup for this device is very easy . I was able to successfully use this remote on my Windows 7 PC , KDLINKS A100 ( Running Android 4.2.2 ) , andSony NSX-40GT1 40-Inch Google TV ( Running Android 3.2by placing the USB dongle into the USB port of each device . After a few moments I was able to successfully activate the mouse to indicate that the remote was successfully installed . The mouse and keyboard functioned properly , without any lag . Unlike other previous keyboard wireless mouse pointers , this one was very accurate and sensitive . I like the feedback when you press any key as it feels very comfortable and lets you know that a key was pressed . The keyboard was initially awkward , as the center of the remote splits each side , and my thumbs barely reach the center keys when my hands wrap around the remote . With time , I was able to get around the awkwardness of the keyboard , and enjoyed using it.The majority of keys functioned the same on all three devices , but several of the multimedia and right click buttons functioned differently : The A100 was the most accurate device , as it was able to respond to each multimedia button accurately , but right click button functioned as the back button ( which was actually very convenient while in mouse mode ) .The Sony Google TV responded to F6-F12 buttons accurately but not to F1-F5 ( excluding F4 ) . I was able to control Google Music very accurately . This remote basically seemed to replace the original remote well.My Windows 7 PC responded to F3 , F5 , and F7-F12 , but not to any other button . My PC also responded to this as a & # 8220 ; Microsoft Wired Keyboard 600 & # 8221 ; which looked like I could map some of the buttons but I never figured out which button was which . My PC has not had any remote , so far , that is able to control Google Music , which is unfortunate , but it was able to successfully control Plex.Overall , I recommend this remote to anyone who is looking for a multimedia remote for their media center , and is why I give this product 5 out of 5 stars . This product is a great replacement to any Android enabled TV remote.Pros : + Air mouse and keyboard give the functionality of a complete set of peripherals without the large amount of space.+ Mouse and keyboard function properly without lag.+ Mouse was very sensitive to movement , but just enough.+ Key press feedback is very nice.+ Setup is very easy as it is plug-and-play.+ Compatible with all platforms that use a USB interface ( Android/Windows/Mac/Linux ) .+ Size and weight comparable to an average TV remote.+ USB dongle can be stored inside remote when not in use , which avoids it from being lost.+ Android button allows users to turn on/off mouse functions when they are no longer needed.Cons : - Keyboard is initially very awkward due to space in the center that is used for the air remote.- Each device reacted differently to multimedia buttons.- Uses AAA batteries instead of a rechargeable battery.- Back cover was very difficult to initially remove.I was provided a sample in exchange for an honest and thorough review .	1
I have been using this device for about 6 weeks . Overall it works pretty good . It takes a little time to get used to how to work the Air Mouse . I use this with an Android G-Box device . The keyboard is very responsive and gets the job done . I found that having fully charged batteries yields the best performance results . I use rechargable batteries in mine . When the batteries start to get run down the air mouse gets a little choppy . I just recharge the bateries weekly to make sure it performs as needed .	1
TaoTronics TT-MK003 keyboard has white plastic keys and a silver-tone metal face . Looks stylish . The keys are hard plastic . It effortlessly paired with my Le Pan S tablet with Android OS 4.0.3 . Simply turn the keyboard on and press the Connect button on the keyboard so it becomes discoverable . Turn the tablet & # 8217 ; s Bluetooth on . The tablet finds the keyboard and asks the user to type a four-digit number on the keyboard followed by the Return key . I also paired it with my Smart phone with Android OS 4.1.1 . Same pairing process . Now I can do heavy duty e-mailing using the keyboard with the phone . Nice ! For some trips , I don & # 8217 ; t need to bring a notebook PC if only e-mail is needed . With an Android & # 8217 ; s office suite and a Bluetooth mouse , I guess you can do much more.Typing is comfortable , perhaps better than some notebook PCs because it is tilted rather than flat . Its width is almost the same as my standard desktop PC & # 8217 ; s keyboard & # 8217 ; s main block width ( only 1/4 & # 34 ; shorter ) . For the price , you can & # 8217 ; t beat the productivity increase . I will bring it with me for some future trips.By the way , I also paired the keyboard with my Blackberry PlayBook ( OS V.2.1.01526 ) without any trouble . The process is the same . However , when I tried to pair with my two older Android phones running Android OS 2.x , both failed . The phones asked the user to type in 0000 or 1234 on the phone ( not keyboard ) . Different process from that used for Android 4.x .	1
I ordered this one evening and found it in my mailbox the very next day . I 'm pretty sure I live down the street from the Amazon hub . My immediate impression was , & # 34 ; Wow ! & # 34 ; . This thing feels solid like it should have a Logitech logo on it . I saw a YouTube review from some kid that really liked it . I have to tell you that I agree with him 100 percent . The tactile feel of the eraser head buttons gives you confidence while typing . The air mouse feature works without a hitch . The only thing I find difficult with the air mouse is right clicking on a Windows machine . It is hard to keep your hand still enough to right click . It keeps wanting to & # 34 ; move the shortcut here ? & # 34 ; instead . Other than that , it is amazing.I purchased another one for my father along with an Android stick for his 80th birthday . I think he 's going to get the hang of it pretty quickly .	1
I got this to log in and check the IP of my Raspberry Pi when I move it from network to network . After that I usually VNC in . The mouse feature works better than I had expected with a very accurate gyroscopic input . I may buy another to use for presentations . So far the initial batteries I installed are still working . I 'd say it 's been more than two months.Not for touch typing .	1
I bought this for the G-box MX2 . I powered up the unit with 3 AAA batteries ( not included ) . I inserted the included usb dongle into the G-box and it worked . I did have a little trouble using the air mouse but that is because I was not used to it . In my opinion , people use to the wii would not have this problem . The remote is light and easy to use . The keyboard was very nicely laid out.One issue I had was the on/off button . I was hoping that it could control the on/off function of the G-box . It did not . While the G-box was on , I clicked on the off button and it did disconnect the G-box from the TV . Whatever was on the screen before was gone and the TV was registering a `` no signal '' message . But the G-box itself was still on ( blue on light was still on ) . Clicking the on button again produced no results , TV `` no signal '' and blue light still on . I had to use the G-box remote to turn that off.When the G-box was off , nothing happens when I click the on button . It does make this a pain to use since I need both remotes.This would be a 5 star rating if the on/off button issue could be resolved.Update : I contacted the seller via email and got an immediate reply back . They offered a full refund is I wanted . I think this kind of customer service deserves additional stars , so I changed my rating to 5 stars .	1
Bough this for my android set top box and it works fantastic , much nicer than using keyboard with touchpad . Takes a little practice navigating using gyroscope but becomes second nature in matter of minutes . Highly recommend .	1
I want to be honest upfront , TaoTronics sent me this product to review.Packaging - there were n't any pros or cons.Feel - the construction and weigh reminded me of an Apple keyboard . It seemed quite sturdy . The keys were easy to use and gave a good response to my typing.Pairing - could n't have been simpler , set the devices up for pairing and it then your asked to type in a pairing code through the keyboard . It really was simple.Layout - I was able to use this keyboard with my Mac , Windows 7 and my android tablet . I did not try with an Ipad or any & # 34 ; I & # 34 ; iteration.I really only found two issues with this keyboard:1 . There is no caps lock light . That may not be an issues , but if you 're using this with a laptop and you need to login , you could potentially put your password in wrong because you 've accidentally hit the caps lock key.2 . The second is a give an take issue . Power savings on this device is great , but it does n't take long for the device to enter power saving mode . Not minutes , but seconds from the last keystroke . It actually seemed like it took the device longer to exit power save mode and connect back to a device than it took it to go to sleep after typing the last character.I was just on a flight an used this with my android tablet . It worked very well . I probably would have annoyed the flight crew if they knew I was using a blue tooth link.Overall I would give this keyboard a positive review .	1
This is a wonderful device . I bought this based on a review on you tube ( some cool tech ) . It feels a little on the cheap side like the difference between a fine bourbon and just shelf bourbon , just do n't have that cadillac feel . wish Logitech Harmony would design one of these . Maybe they do . There is a learning curve for using a air mouse but once you get the hang of it . I said where have you been all my life . I 'm using it on a Minix Neo 5 mini it is a real joy to use and worth the money i paid . Dont hesitate to buy this . I have all kinds of electronic gear i have had a lot of product in my hand over the last 30yrs of my additiction to gadgets . GREAT TOY you will either love it or hate it . I 'm hooked just buy it .	1
I have my Xoom tablet mounted on a charger/speaker/stand device . At the angle its at , its difficult to type on screen . This mini wireless bluetooth keyboard handles that problem . Now its like using a laptop..Took the keyboard out of the box and had it connected in less than 1 minute ( after adding 2 aaa batteries ) . Really a breeze to connect . Keys feel really good and are quiet and responsive . I love that it has a sleep function which saves my batteries , however you should turn it off if you do n't plan to use it for a while.Very lightweight and easy to throw in a messengers bag or backpack to use on the go . Waterproof and dustproof is a real bonus . Great addition to your bluetooth devices that need a keyboard for a low price.Highly recommend this product .	1
Set up was a huge pain ( one note -- typing in the address of the device as listed in the instructions in the browser did not work ; I was only able to proceed when I set the IP address of the unit to a static/reserved address in the router , and used that IP address to continue set up . My friend had the exact same issue ) .Also , I 'm in Houston , and this does work with CenterPoint 's smart meter.Once I got over the setup hurdle , it has worked great . Coupled with Bidgely , we really like the unit , and we adjust our usage in real time when we see large spikes in the graph ( we usually monitor the device with the Bidgely iPhone app throughout the day ) .	1
I am thankful for the more detailed reviews of some of the other customers , however I will say the process with PG & E in San Francisco was extremely easy , even within the condo complex I 'm in ( yes it works on the 3rd floor/top floor I 'm in , with the meters being in the basement , which is impressive ) . I simply filled out the PG & E han form , got a reply within 2 days , ordered the device and immediately registered the device upon receipt from amazon , got a reply within 2 days , and called the phone number in the reply and was online within 5 min , then registered with bidgely in 5 more min . Very streamlined , very cool . Firmware from amazon was fine without any modification .	1
I am so impressed with the value . Three gorgeous cases , shield and a great pen ! It arrived quickly . Very easy to use .	1
I got this for my moms MP3 player she loves it it protects her MP3 player well from scratches and ticks	1
I bought more and gave them to my kids.They fit well feel slick and work to protect . Ignore all the crying reviews about not being able to feel or see . They work .	1
I purchased these for my daughter for a Christmas gift . The price was awesome for the quality . I would purchase these again .	1
These speakers are fun , but please do not expect BOSE quality . The sound is acceptable . Light show is kind of different .	1
I contacted seller about the one stream not going straight up . The stream went across the other 3 streams of water instead of straight up . It was distracting when I was viewing them . We emailed back and forth several times and seller was very kind to refund my full purchase since they were unable to correct the one speaker . If you get a perfect set of speakers , you will enjoy the cool lights and streams while you play music . I would have liked them very much if they were perfect straight up streams of water . I 've seen these for more money so I say , try them . Maybe you 'll get a perfect pair of speakers .	1
If you 're like me and cords just seem to get in your way , then this is the perfect solution to your problem . These headphones fit snugly in my ears and the controls are easy enough to work out . The battery life easily lasts throughout the day , and pairing is simple . My only gripe with this product is that the connection does cut in and out at times . I 'm not sure if it 's my phone or the headphones ( I currently have the Galaxy Nexus phone ) , but it does cut out sometimes . However this does not occur when I am connected to my tablet , so it is either my phone or the movement from when I 'm walking or running The sound quality is better than I would have expected considering the small size of the headphones , and the fact that the music is being transmitted over bluetooth . Overall I would definitely recommend this product to those of you who exercise and listen to music or just those of you who hate dealing with cords.Also , I have so far been unable to connect these headphones to my laptop for some odd reason . Connection to my girlfriends iPhone and iPad , as well as my galaxy nexus and asus transformer prime tablet worked flawlessly , but I can not get it to connect with my laptop . ( For the record I can get my phone/tablet to connect to my laptop with no issues ) .Hope this review helps .	1
I own a number of PMPs and recently acquired the Droid Razr MAXX HD . When working out on cardio equipment , I have sent many a PMP or my new Droid to the floor because my hand caught the earbud 's cord and jerked the media player off the platform ... really not cool . I purchased the Motorola wireless buds a few years ago but was n't impressed because they were so uncomfortable but after almost destroying some good PMPs and my phone , I thought it was time to look again.After reading a number of reviews , I settled on these , JayBird BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Midnight Black . What I really like about these:1 . Sound is great - I use the Comply T-500 Isolation Earphone Tips and have been for years ; great product.2 . Connectivity is fantastic - I leave my PMP and/or phone in mostly a 'line of sight ' , e.g . no obstacles and walk away 20 feet with still no loss in reception3 . Controls - easy to advance tunes , lower/increase volume , turn off and more4 . Charging - easy to charge with micro-usb slot in right earbud ; I just leave them plugged into my PC when not using ( same as my phone ) What I do n't like but really more of a personal issue : I ride motorcycles/scooters around town and more . Listening to tunes or navigation makes a trip so much more enjoyable , I do n't think I could ride without the availability of these options . The JayBirds do not have noise cancelling and I do hear quite a bit of wind noise when on my bikes . The media sound is clean but the air noise almost equals the media sound so almost a wash on that . Again , this a personal issue because using them in the gym , I have absolutely no issues and really enjoy them ( owned for about a week now ) . I 'm not sure about road cycling and possible wind noise but I hear wind at about 15-20 mph so bear that in mind . NOTE : I did contact JayBird and they stated that the Comply tips were the best option to reduce wind noise.I 'm very pleased with my purchase and plan on using these in the gym or around the house but when riding a motorcycle/scooter , I 'll stick with my other buds.Feel free to ask questions	1
I bought these to mainly use in the gym since cords usually get tangled up or caught on things but I love them so much , I actually started to use them for all of my music needs , even using them with my computer.I 'll go through some pros and cons of these headphones : Pros : Great sound ; lightweight ; comfortable ( after figuring out what fits best , more later on this ) ; Decent battery life ; sweatproof warranty ; comes with a good solid case to keep them protected ; nice charging cableCons : High price but worth every penny ; Sometimes I fat finger the controls and goes to a voice command . After it goes back to the music , the sound is off but easily fixed.After getting these fitted , these things wo n't fall out without a good tug . I went with the over ear , behind the neck setup . It seemed to fit like a glove using that configuration . Also , when I would need to pull them out and talk to someone , I just hang them over my ears.In conclusion , if you are looking for a great sounding headset that gets you away from a lot of wires , these are it . I was kind of nervous about buying them because they are expensive but I should have bought them sooner ! If you are even considering these , just buy them and you wo n't be disappointed .	1
I have the Motorola s9 , and s10 , the Jay Bird ( the older version ) , normally I switch between each of these when I goto the gym ... Just got these , they go loud , I do n't even need to use my volume boost app ... Clean sound , bass , comfortable ... you do have to play with the pieces to get it to fit right ... once you do , its easy as cake ! Very pricy , as advertised super long battery life !	1
Sound is great ... easy to charge and use . Small case to carry around in bag.Small footprint so it is not a bundle of wires.Did not need or use wings.Good product .	1
I work out with these headphones and are worth every penny , slippage when getting sweaty , the rage on it is amazing , over 30ft , through walls and doors . no issue with em so far !	1
First , I 'm no workout junkie , I simply wanted another wireless headphone set . This product does the job very well . I will admit that I caught a set here for $ 80 ( like new ) . They were flawless.These headphones require a solid seal in the ear to deliver quality sound . I was able to achieve this by using the largest plugs . Once I got the seal , the sound was outstanding . I have several pairs of the in-ear style headphones . This set revivals them all . I hear no discernible difference b/t this set and my other buds . They were worth the $ 80 price tag . However , I will admit , had I paid the standard $ 150 price tag , I 'm not sure I 'd feel the same . These buds are good and an excellent value around $ 100 , but $ 150 is a tad high.The sound is very , very good ; bass is solid , mids are really strong and highs are solid as well . The buds can produce very high volume in your ears , but when wearing clothing ( other than a simple t-shirt ) , the small wire can be a slight nuisance . I 've worn the buds to work and the wire snags slightly on my collared shirts . Again , this is only a small issue . Also , the battery life is fairly short , but charging is simple and fairly quick . And finally , once I found the proper size plugs , sealing them in my ear was not an issue . However , I can see how these things can be subject to slippage w/workout gurus.As noted earlier , I simply wanted an alternative pair of Bluetooth headphones . I have an on ear par that are bulky at times . These things are fairly compact , and come w/a small sized carrying case . The case can fit inside a jacket pocket , purse or in the carry bag on your bike . Overall , for my use , I give these buds 5* .	1
These headphones hold a decent charge and easily syncs with devices . Sound quality is mediocre . I do not feel that these were worth $ 150 , though .	1
I travel a lot and like yo have a versatile set of headphones with me . They need to cancel plane noise as well as work well at the gym and during walking/running outside . I also prefer very compact for obvious reasons and wireless if possible . I 've had 3 Bose headsets and multiple ear buds . None have compared to these . They have superior sound quality in all my environments . The Bluetooth connection is easy and always works even though I often leave the music player in my gum bag , pants pocket , etc . I did follow advice on here and added the extra tips to ensure a good seal with my ear . Mine never fall out . And with pause and volume controls right on the cord that connects the two buds , it 's easy to manage them on my iTouch , iPod and even Galaxy phone . If I could change anything it would be longer battery life . I 'm sometimes on a plane for 12+ hours and need to recharge them mid flight while I 'm napping . Otherwise they are perfection !	1
I recently purchased these headphones for working out . I wanted to be able to stream from my phone and do a cross fit type program without having to wear my phone . In that regard these headphones are excellent . They paired with my HTC one effortlessly and have a reliable range of 60 feet or so . This allows me to leave my phone on the floor or a shelf and move around the workout environment.I have a number of other relatively high end in ear headphones ( etymotic , klipsch and an old set of shure ) but they all have cables . In regards to sound performance I do n't think these are up there with the etymotic or klipsch but they are good . If you have never had in ear headphones you will quickly learn that the sound is directly related to the fit . If you do not get a good seal they will sound tinny and flat . When i press these buds hard into my ears I get good sound but have yet to get them to stay sealed without holding them so I get weak sound . I have tried all three sizes of ear tips but still get mediocre results . I have read good things about the Comply foam tips so have ordered those . I am confident that once I get the proper fit these headphones will sound good . Functionally they appear to be great , I just need to get the fit dialed in . I would give 5 stars but it seems lots of people have had a hard time getting a proper fit . I have never had an issue with other brands so I think the tips are subpar . Give the stock silicone tips a try they may work for you , but you may end up spending 15 or 20 bucks on a few sets of aftermarket tips to get a good seal and fit.Update - I recieved theComply Tsx-500 Comfort PLUS Earphone Tips ( Black , 3 Pair , Mixed ) and tried them on the Bluebuds . So far they have given me a better fit and they stay in place much better than the stock silicone tips . They are a really tight fit to get on to the Bluebuds however . I thought i tore the first pair getting them on but they ended up being ok. Once i get them on and situated the sound has definately improved but I think it is subpar to similarly priced earbuds from Etymotic and Klipsch ( but remember those are wired solutions ) . All in all I am happy with the purchase but the bluetooth convenience comes at the price of overall sound quality in the same price range .	1
I had a pair of Motorola S11-flex which stopped working entirely after a week of light use . I decided to try the BlueBuds out instead and was impressed by the sound quality , battery life , comfort , and quality . However , even after extensively testing all of the sizes of tips to get a good fit , I still find myself constantly twisting them back into my ears to get a better seal while I 'm at the gym . Based on my experiences with both the S11 , and the BlueBuds , my idea bluetooth headphones would have all the technology of the bluebuds but a solid strip of plastic that can put some pressure inward on your head to keep the buds securely in place . That said , the S11 's implementation of this concept is not perfect either because they have a solid strip of plastic that sticks out further than it needs to and an adjustable rubber strip that holds it in place . The ideal solution would be an adjustable and lockable rear band like the bluebuds has but one that has structure and holds things in place . Maybe someday ...	1
I got these for my husband for Christmas and he 's been working out so much more because he gets so excited to use these ! The sound quality of the music is excellent . I have another pair of wireless headphones and these are far superior . The fit in your ear nicely , come with many different size buds to ensure they will fit you . You can also wear them under the ear or over the ear , whichever you prefer . They stay in the ear during his workouts , which he usually has problems with . He loves these !	1
I bought the BlueBuds to use for exercising and I am amazed at how good they are . First time you put them on they might be a little awkward , but one you get used to them they are very comfortable , have great sound , and the battery last for a really long time . Sometimes within a run I have to squeeze them back in the ear , but that 's sporadic . I was worried they would not last for long ( I 'm normally rough on headphones and end up breaking them ) , but these are working great and are like new after months of use . I would suggest that these work better for someone that is used to ( or prefers ) in-ear headphones .	1
I wanted to give this 4/12 stars but that was n't available . I sweat a ton when working out and these take it like a champ . They also stay in better than others I have used thanks to the wings . However probably for the same reason ( the wings ) they leave my ears a bit sore after extended times on the elliptical . Sound quality is excellent . I read or watched a review that said the base was n't excellent and I totally disagree . That person must have chosen the wrong size ear bud . The range is crazy on these are crazy . I had them plugged in upstairs in my house and tried to answer my iPhone when I was downstairs . Unfortunately they were still paired , and the sound was being output to my BlueBuds . Pre-purchase , I felt the price was very high but because of the lifetime sweat guaranty I purchased them anyway . So if you can handle the price ( much cheaper from Amazon than buying direct ) I think they will turn out to be a good long term investment . I had another pair of good sound quality head phones that I paid $ 50 for but they stopped working when they got too much sweat on them .	1
Upper end so it goes to say you get what you pay for . There are some setting up that takes trial and error to get right . After that you will not be disappointed .	1
JayBird BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Storm White works and comes with a case a pair of earphone accessories and a data cable for charging ( works with iphone 5 s ) . let us hope it does not end up on the rack of shame ...	1
I 've used the BlueBuds X daily for two months for the gym , cross fit , and running - and they are excellent . For anyone complaining about fit , it took me a few days to figure out the right combination of buds/flanges for my ears , however , once I found the magical combination , they have been perfect . The sound is superb and louder/clearer than the Motorola S11-Flex ( I own these as well ) . For running , I prefer the `` X-fit '' behind my head - do n't have to worry about the wire hanging on your neck . Regarding sweat , these have held up and I have n't noticed any problems at all ! Battery lasts a solid 5-6 days ( 1 hour workout each day ) and recharging is fast . If you 're looking for a quality pair of headphones for the gym and do n't want to get tangled in wires any longer - these are the headphones you want . Period .	1
I 'm using these mainly with the Nexus 5 and I have had no issues at all . They paired fine and have be reconnecting and staying connected without issue . Using the provided ear pieces and instructions , I was able to find a comfortable fit and I wear them no problem for about 6 hours . There is very little bulk to these which is impressive for being bluetooth . The ear buds do stick pretty far out of my ear which is something to consider if you want to wear them outside in the winter and plan on wearing a stocking cap or earmuffs . I find the sound quality to be excellent , but I 'm no audiophile or anything . They charge quickly and last for about 6 or so hours . The only reason I took off one star is for the battery life . I wish it could make it through an 8 hour day . Overall , I 'm very happy with them .	1
My girlfriend uses them to run ... She loves them ! They do n't slide around and cause issues like other 's have complained about .	1
After reading different reviews and owning one of the LG Tones series I thought I would give these a try . I thought I knew what to expect but was pleasantly surprised with their sound quality , and volume .	1
These rock ! I have tested at least 2 dozen headsets . For running there is simply no better option . Use them in the behind the head configuration and they do n't move and sound great . Customer service was awesome as well.Note I paired mien with decibuls earphone caps for an even better fit . Worth every penny to keep these guys sounding great during the long runs .	1
This is my first Jaybird Bluetooth headphones . I got it last week and so far very impressed with the technical performance . The claim is dead on and I 'm very happy with the sound quality . The packaging is very impressive as well , very posh . But it 's not perfect , a couple of things I wish it has include the soft buds they call secure fit is not as comfortable as my MIE2i but not bad at all . I have this configured to extreme fit ( X-Fit as Jaybird calls it ) and I could n't be happier . The second is the price , these two are not deal breakers and definitely the positive outweighs the negative.On the other hand , everything else was done right from the low profile to the back of the neck design to the 8 hour battery life , I like the sound prompts from Jenna - the voice AI . The connection to the device is great and the battery status indicator on my iPhone 5 is a plus . I 've considered getting the SIEi2 but at almost the same price , I picked this for obvious reasons . The sound quality is great , I might say comparable to my Bose MIE2i . That 's excellent considering no wires ! If you can cough up $ 170 then do n't think twice , I got mine from Best Buy mainly because I had a $ 20 gift card so it was n't not that painful . I used to be a varsity volleyball player ( still play advanced volleyball ) and I use this during warm ups , other players use Dr. Dre beats with wires - not a good idea . For athletes , runners or gym rats , give this a try and you will love it . I just upgraded it from 4 stars to 5 stars , everyday I use it and I 'm still very happy and satisfied with it . For now , this is the best in the market.Questions are welcome.Hope this helps ! Update March 13 , 2013 : I realized the sound quality is better than my Bose MIE2i , it 's actually comparable to Klipsch S4i . The only difference is that the S4i moves like crazy and it 's hard to position , it wo n't stay put and you have to shove it deep into your ear canal . The Bluebuds X is easier to fit in and also seals the sound inside . I tested calling friends and it 's pretty good , weird I can hear myself from inside but very good . The only thing it does n't work well is with Siri , I do n't know if it 's my contacts but with extreme fit configuration Siri can not pick up my contacts accurately .	1
This review compares theJayBird BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Midnight Blackto theTenqa Fit Bluetooth In-Ear Bluetooth Earbuds for Sports , BlackandYurbuds Inspire Limited Edition Wireless ( Bluetooth ) . For reference , my wired headphones of choice areEtymotic Research ER-4PT MicroPro Noise-Isolating In-Ear Earphones ( Black ) andAudio-Technica ATH-M50 Professional Studio Monitor Headphones with Coiled CableSound quality : Let 's start right here , because it is game , set match to the BlueBuds . With a proper seal , they clearly sound the best , albeit with a touch too much bass . With the piece that holds them in your ear properly attached , the in-ear channel does n't move out of the sweet spot like many cheap in-ear headphones do . Spoken words were very clear , and music sounded more true than I had expected possible from a wireless connection.I 'd rate the Fits as a surprisingly close second . The sound was pretty good , but just felt more narrow and lacking the detail of the BlueBuds . Like many earbuds , they gave the impression of sound being pushed to you , rather than floating all around . Given their much lower price , I find them a very acceptable backup pair , if you wish to keep a backup pair.The YurBuds are , at the end of the day , earbuds - and they sound like it . Granted , probably the best sounding pair of earbuds I 've ever used , but not even on par with a less expensive wired earbud like theME Electronics EP-N9P-BK-MEE N9P Black In-Ear Noise Isolating Earbuds . To make up for their lower fidelity ( or perhaps to appeal to a certain market ) the bass is over the top . For sound quality alone , I returned themFitThis is where BlueBuds had the biggest advantage . Using the usual wet the tip , wrap your opposite arm behind your head and pull the ear out while inserting technique , I found that they fit pretty well , and particularly appreciate the over the ear setup that allows you to cinch the cord and have the cord around the back of your head , rather than hanging loose on your shirt . As good as they sounded , the fact that this setup meant I did n't have to push them back in every time I turned my head was the deal clincher . I have 2 requests , however : 1 . There needs to be a stiff cable near the ear like theMEElectronics Sport-Fi S6P Noise Isolating In-Ear Earphone with Microphone/Remote/Volume Control/Sports Arm Band , Red/Black . without a moldable wire , the cable really does n't fit up & over the ear properly . 2 . I wish the in-ear component was a little longer . It is a too short and stubby , and thus does n't get as good a fit as my Etymotics ( nor does it stay as securely , especially since the outer ear components tend to keep it from going in as far as they should ) .YurBuds wins second here . It took me a bit to figure them out , but once I did , they stayed in pretty securely . The biggest problem is that the cord would stick to my shirt , and I 'd need to adjust them . No problems running with them.Last are the Fits . They are fine for weightlifting , but they are too heavy and pull out during more aerobic activities . The cable is sticky , and I usually have to wear the cable under my chin to keep them from tugging out when the cable sticks to the back of my shirt.ComfortThe BlueBuds are light and fit well . The over the ear configuration would be ideal for forgetting they were there , if they had a moldable cable . I have worn them for 4 hours at a time without discomfort.The Fits were fine , though I have only had them on for 2 hours at a timeI hated the YurBuds . The sticky rubber that goes in the ear canal itches , and they stay in place by putting a lot of pressure on places on your ear that are not used to being touched . I left them in for 4 hours at a time , thinking I might grow used to them . Not only did I not get accustomed to the feel , they actually felt worse the longer I wore them.Battery life3-way tie . The BlueBuds claim an 8 hour battery life . I call BS , I have n't gotten more than 6 hours on a charge . The others also lasted within a half hour of 6 hoursConnectionThe Fits actually maintain a connection from the furthest away , but are also the most finicky , sometimes dropping for no noticeable reason.Blue Buds and YurBuds had a similar distance to connection , but the BlueBuds had a much more reliable connection than YurBudsControlsYurBuds finally win ! I love the location of the start/stop button , though the volume buttons could be a bit larger and more logically placedBlueBuds in line control is fine ( and perhaps not having the controls on the buds themselves helps keep them secure , when fiddling with them ) The Fits do n't have a start/stop button ? Seriously ? Half the point of wireless headphones is to leave your device in your bag or pocket so you do n't have to find it while you do stuff . Absolutely bonehead oversight , and for many is an unforgivable omissionConclusionHands down , the BlueBuds are the best wireless headphones I have tested to date . They are light , comfortable , and have a great positioning system that takes the cord off of the back of your shirt . Their sound quality is only slightly below my Etymotics , high praise indeed . I wish that they had a moldable wire to wrap around your ears when using the over the ear configuration , had a longer in ear channel , and the battery lasted the claimed 6 hours.The Fits are an excellent value , delivering surprisingly good sound quality and a reasonable fit , at a low price point . The omission of a play/pause button should probably make you look elsewhere , however.The YurBuds are a major disappointment . I saw them demo 'd at CES 2013 , and waited a full year before they came out . The sound quality is terrible , the bass is dialed up too high , and I could not wait to take them out from the moment I put them in .	1
Works good for price but I would n't recommend for people with small ears like me . Luckuly I had Sam tri-ear pieces from my beats that worked good . Sound amazing and last me about a week before recharge .	1
I love these stands . I bought 3 of them , because the price was right , and I needed a simple solution.I am using these to hold some Nexus 7 tablets so I can see my security cameras , but they work fine with my Nexus 10 and my Galaxy S4 , so there does n't seem to be a tablet that these stands ca n't handle . These are stable and hold the tablets at a great angle . I also keep the 3rd stand in my travel laptop case so I can use it in hotels when I watch movies on my Nexus 10.I would buy these again , and may pick up a few extras , just to have around .	1
There are several brands of this very light and useful handle for holding light cameras for low-level shooting , but they do have some variations in details and prices . The top handle of the ForeGrip ( and accessory shoe ) is parallel with the base ( I prefer this ) , but others like the Zeikos point the handle ( and shoe ) down slightly ( useful for close-in shooting with a directional mic or light mounted on the handle ) . They also may , or may not , have non-skid-surfaced & # 34 ; skids & # 34 ; on the sides between the feet ( the ForeGrip has them , the Zeikos does n't - and I 'm OK with either way ... ; - ) . Anyway , for a very inexpensive camera handle , this item is very useful . BTW , the screw used to attach the camera may extend too far into the bottom of some cameras for safety , but it is easy to trap the metal piece inside the handle base so that the screw can be removed and a washer added on its shaft between the bottom of the base and the plastic knob in order to shorten the effective length of the screw above the platform surface .	1
Bragged about this item so much got a few peoole interested in buying one . More than perfect for the price and the object itself	1
& # 34 ; I bought this for my wife 's 24 inch , LED TV to be used as a monitor for her Dell 1525 Inspiron Laptop , it was becoming hard for her to see the little 15.4 laptop screen , and it help 's a lot save space and makes it easy to change out cable 's and connection's. & # 34 ; It is strong sturdy and can handle the flexibility , when adjusting it for custom use. & # 34 ; I Highly Recommend this product. & # 34 ;	1
The product is amazing and I will get into that , but please be warned , you will need to go buy your own bolts ( and nuts if you like ) if you want to secure this onto your desk . The two bolts they provide are the wrong thread and will not work so PLEASE do not force them.In regards to the product , it is fantastic , once I got my bolts from Home Depot , I set up the monitor stand with my 27 inch Crossover 27Q LED-P in about five minutes . My desk is n't the most stable thing in the world and this monitor hand carries the wait well . No real wobble . For $ 30 I believe this is the best mounting arm you can get . I would avoid similar ones like the Monoprice because they cost the same but do less . Also , for reference , the Crossover 27 inch monitor is a very heavy monitor , it is half metal and weighs about 15lb I think .	1
Got this to protect my ipad . My daughter carries it around with the handle and it still is in one piece . Works really well , however it is difficult to get the ipad out when I want to charge it ( I ca n't get it hooked up with the cover on ) . It sits up nicely in a couple different configurations for her to watch a show or play a game . Definitely worth the money to protect your ipad .	1
When my husband got his kindle fire I searched amazon for a toddler proof case and came up empty . On our ipads and iphones we have Griffin Survivor cases and I recommend them highly . Since I could not find a child proof kindle fire case I just bought him a leather case . The leather case has been totally ineffective at protecting the kindle from drops from our kids as the case opens up and the kindle fire takes the brunt of the impact.So , I was very excited to see this KHOMO SAFEKIDS Child Proof case for the kindle fire . The case is made with dense heavy duty EVA foam . And Khomo says that it is the same kind that is used in the soles of high end sneakers . Additionally , the foam on the case fully covers the back , sides and extends above the surface of the screen of the kindle fire , which prevents scratches or other injury to the screen . What is great about this foam case is that it can provide extreme shock protection to the kindle fire . Finally , we have found a toddler proof case where I can allow my kids to look at , enjoy and handle the kindle fire without fear that one small drop will crack the screen.Another feature that I really like about this case is the carrying handle . The previous case we had that was leather had no handle and the leather case holding he kindle fire slipped out of my hands on occasion , causing the kindle fire to fall and risk damage . This handle is great because it is very easy to grip and keep ahold of so I do n't fear accidentally having it slip and drop out of my hands.. The other cool thing about the handle is that you can fold in back and the kindle fire stands up . This is especially nice when the kids are viewing a movie online . Since the kindle fire stands up with this case I do n't have to prop it up against anything for movie viewing and risk it constantly slipping and falling down.In sum , this was a great buy and I am so happy with KHOMO for producing such a protective and child friendly case for the kindle fire !	1
Without these , my 4 yr old could n't comfortably watch 3d movies with us . Cheap and they fit a small child 's face much better than the standard glasses . They 're also a little thicker and sturdier feeling ( good thing for a young child ) .	1
My little ones can now enjoy all of their 3D movies without smudging , breaking and misplacing the adult glasses . And the glasses fit their little melons much better .	1
great for kids , fits well on small heads and little faces and cheap enough you do n't worry about breaking them .	1
We got a new 3D setup this year and I would see the normal glasses on my 9 year old daughter and think how huge they were . Knowing her friends would come over sooner or later I looked for smaller glasses for them . She loves her own pair and of course took a pink pair for herself.She has n't mentioned any difference in viewing the content between the two types , so I would think they work great . We have a Vizio 70 & # 34 ; 3D TV that these are used with in case that helps anyone .	1
Great price . Did n't need four pairs but gambled cos I needed a single pair for my 10 year old god-daughter so that she could watch Piranha 3D more comfortably . They fit her well and came in blue which is her favorite color . She made it through the sequel , Piranha 3DD and Bait with no complaints , so obviously great glasses for kids . As a bonus , I have three extra pairs laying around in case she brings friends over for movie night . That is a total lie . There is not a chance in HELL I am ever going to let that happen , but having the glasses laying around makes me look like a good host and a semi-thoughtful godfather ... .	1
I purchased this for a college student to use with a Dell N5010 with a 240GB Solid State drive . So far she has been getting over 5 hrs of battery life , it started at 4.5 hours , but has risen to over 5 hours in a week . She is running the battery for classes & has not had any issues at this point . I wanted a longer warranty since she is 4 1/2 hours away , so lending her a laptop during the time needed to get a replacement is out of the question . So far we are very happy with the battery .	1
The Dell Laptop Battery ( 6 Cell ) was only giving me an hour and a half of computer time . I did not want to pay $ 175.00 for a Dell made 9 cell battery . After reading many reviews I found the Anker Laptop Battery was a suitable replacement and the cost was only one third the price of the Dell Battery . I am now getting 5 to 6 hours battery life out of the Anker . I am extremely please with my purchase .	1
Got this battery to have a spare for my Dell Inspiron 15R ( N5010 ) .At first I thought I was getting a stock replacement battery , but this is actually better ! It 's rated to 73 watts where the original is only 44 watts.Since it 's thicker , it also works to prop up the rear of the laptop for cooling eliminating the need for a cooling pad.In my tests I ran under 100 % CPU load from a full charge until the laptop died.With the original batter I got just a few minutes over one hour of continuous usage . With the Anker battery I got over twice the run time . Clocking in at 2 hours and 12 minutes on a full charge at 100 % CPU load ! And for the price , it ca n't be beat . So far I 'm very pleased with every Anker product I 've owned !	1
No issues with my dell 15 inch laptop . Followed instructions and did 2 cycles of draining battery to 7 % then fully recharge . Lasts a long time as compared to the dell 6 cell when new .	1
Very useful arm and i Use it with my Zoom mic . Quality acceptable for the price and well manufactured . Can buy with confidence .	1
I love the fact that this is such a compact arm that holds so well , and that the entire design is metal with the exception of the knob . As soon as you tighten the knob , you can feel that it is n't going anywhere and it wo n't damage any of your expensive equipment also , it moves in so many different directions it seems like the configurations could be endless depending on your needs so it will always do what you need it to . I am using this for a 7 & # 34 ; external monitor mounted to my 15mm DSLR shoulder rig , and this does n't add much weight . I definitely did n't expect it to tighten so well , some of the other tightening knobs on my equipment make you a little uneasy and this makes me feel completely comfortable having it around my camera and holding my monitor . The reason I opted for this one over some of the others is the dual rail locking . I noticed on comments of other arms that a single rail clamp slides around and tends to fall or even fail , so this made more sense , especially after some time if the rail clamp were to weaken a little , so it 's definitely something to consider to make sure everything stays in it 's place . Overall , I could not be happier with this purchase , and would consider buying more for other accessories !	1
These are the best ever in-ear buds - totally cool for the pool . They do n't get in the way like other sets have ... totally love the coil that keeps the cord secure . Love love love these !	1
Works great ! Looks great ! Fits great ! I do n't know what else to say . Would buy again ... .might buy another ! Just click & # 34 ; add to cart & # 34 ; Lol .	1
Used it for a 5 hour seminiar and a couple of weddings , real fast with no problems for HD video	1
used this in S. Korea bc i cant charge my phone with their 220v power and also the prongs are different so this thing helped me until i found an adaptor	1
Awesome Easy to use .	1
Awesome transmitter ! It barely weighs anything and has transmitted clear sound without a problem ! I love it and highly recommend it !	1
My husband bought a pair for himself and we also purchased an additional pair for my best friend . Because of eyesight challenges she is listening to books on her tablet now . She particularly likes the three sizes available to her . My husband likes the choose-a-size as well as the blocking of outside noise .	1
For the price these are terrific .	1
Was a mix up on the product I ordered and what I got . What I got was a five foot cable . Was taken care of after first email . Was given a full refund . Great C/S .	1
Very good performance of this HDMI cable . Initially I thought I will not get exact performance like other gold plated HDMI cables and I was wrong ! Beautiful cable and and its ultra slim . I am saving lots of space because of this cable . Highly recommended .	1
I tried another brand of 'Ultra ' cable and at 50 ' it just did n't work . This cable however is Outstanding . The black ground is solid , no flickers , no snow of any kind and no drop-outs at all . This cable does exactly what they claim it 's supposed to do , Work ! Save yourself time and money and just get this cable 1st .	1
Had the 30 foot version of this Redmere HDMI cable installed between my PC and a MonoPrice 4x2 switch/splitter for 5 months . It works perfectly . I 've also had it connected directly to our Samsung HDTV set . I 've plugged and unplugged it with power on the computer and the switch/splitter or TV with no ill effects , though I do try to remember to power both ends off when doing that . I would buy this cable again .	1
Purchased as a replacement for the Motorola Unit leased with Time Warner . Now getting better download/upload speeds . Very reliable unit . Only wish the connection light did n't blink . I put dark tape over it .	1
This is my second purchase of this item , as we have two homes served by Comcast . Easy to set-up via your computer , suggestyou do not contact Comcast as it will take you over an hour and unnecessary aggravation.Units work super fast , never had a dropped signal , my only issue is my wireless router which ca n't keep up , so I am going to haveto replace it .	1
This modem has been solid since day 1 . I have had no issues , it provides me very fast speeds with Comcast and I have not had to reboot it once since the day I installed it . Would recommend to anyone with Comcast cable internet . I also found the blinking lights on the front to be annoying like other reviewers and put a piece of black tape over them .	1
My only regret is that I did n't buy the SB6141 sooner.After several year using a Linksys CM100 DOCSIS I decided to move up to something better.And the SB6141 is not just 'sorta better ' it 's amazingly better.Setup somewhat puzzling at first . But a call to Comcast Tech support had it setup in a reasonably short time.Compared to my previous speeds this unit is marvelous.Great price for this new white modem.Complaints about the & # 34 ; excessively & # 34 ; bright blue LED 's seem groundless . Blue is my least favorite color . But if it 's objectionable theres lots of solutions . I wo n't waste my time making a long list of ways to deal with that.So simple a child a child could do it ... go rent a child .	1
If you do not want to pay $ 7 per month to rent a modem from your cable provider , buy this modem . It is FAST and inexpensive . Enough said !	1
Works great . I do n't like the cable company & # 34 ; owning & # 34 ; my home WiFi network and already had a dual-band Cisco WiFi router with GigE ports . I was a little concerned about my cable lengths since I my run from the cablemodem to the WiFi router is easily 100 ft ( in-wall stuff ) .I routinely get 65mbps down x 10 mbps up on a 25 mbps plan . Thanks to Cox for being so generous with bandwidth .	1
Excellent modem as very easy to setup on Comcast Cable.So I recently called Comcast asking if they could lower my rate for the & # 34 ; Performance & # 34 ; internet package that I had. & # 34 ; Performance & # 34 ; speed is currently at 25Mbps.My original Motorola Surfboard was an SB5100 Docsis 2.0 with a top speed of 38Mbps that I 've had since about 2004 and has worked like a champ all along.Comcast informed me they could upgrade me to the & # 34 ; Blast & # 34 ; package for less than I was currently paying on the & # 34 ; Performance & # 34 ; .So I said & # 34 ; Go For It & # 34 ; . The & # 34 ; blast & # 34 ; package speed is rated at 50Mbps , so I thought , well , I 'll just keep my modem and get the full 38Mbps capability that it can handle.. Worked great and I was getting 38Mbps.Then , about a week ago , I get an email from Comcast saying they have increased the speed of Blast to 105Mbps . At this point I could wait no longer to upgrade my old but very reliable modem..So I turned right back to the latest/greatest Motorola Surfboard SB6141 with a great price from Amazon . Actually about half the cost I payed for my SB5100 back in 2004.Two days later it arrived at my door . I unpacked it , unplugged my existing modem and plugged this beauty in.TIP : The power supply provided with this model had the exact same voltage , amps , etc as my old modem , so I just reused the power supply without having to reroute any cords . It really was truly & # 34 ; plug n play & # 34 ; .I then unplugged my PC from my router and plugged it directly into the modem ( read a review where people were having problems activating the modem when connected to a router ) . Fired up the modem and then PC . Brought up my Firefox browser and navigated to amazon.com ( or any site you choose ) and I was automagically redirected to the Comcast activation page.I followed the instructions on the page and it downloaded some stuff to the router and it rebooted a few times . After about 10 minutes it was all activated and I was ready to go.I immediately navigated over to speedtest.net to see what kind of speeds I was getting . WOW , I got 111Mbps download and 15Mbps upload.Obviously I ca n't speak to the longevity of this product yet , but hopefully I 'll get another 10 years of service out this surfboard , just like the last one . And with a rated MAX download of 343Mbps , I might just get there..Thanks for reading and have no regrets buying this modem .	1
I chose this unit based off of it being recommended by my ISP . I 'd rather buy the unit myself then have the ISP over charge me with & # 34 ; rental & # 34 ; .I have seen mixed reviews , but mostly good . My experience has been great . Connected at first attempt and has held an optimum connection for the past month . I online game , stream music , and use VoIP ... all while my wife streams HD on our TV and uses her tablet to surf the web.I routinely check my connection speeds and have had no issues with speed or reliability from this unit.It does it 's job ... And looks pretty cool doing it being white with blue & white lights .	1
One of the best modems , if not the best modem on the market and at a good price too . In the long run it is a much better choice than the modem leased by your local ISP . I did find this modem offered for a few dollars cheaper on another site , but buying it through Amazon leaves me with the peace of mind that if any issue does come up , Amazon will be there to help resolve the issue .	1
If you are not a `` techie '' print out the instruction diagrams for connecting this modem to your wireless router before disconnecting your old set-up . Like a lot of people I was getting pretty tired of giving my money to Time Warner Cable to lease a modem/router . Last month they started charging even more ! And the modem/router kept kicking devices off b/c it could n't support more than 5 users . So I invested in this modem and a separate Netgear wireless router . It actually was n't that hard to set everything up . You just have to call the cable company and give them the MAC ID , then log into the website for your router to set-up security . I ca n't wait to return my old router/modem to TWC ... .if only there were more internet service providers around : - ( ...	1
Seems to be working great but think the router is not handling the speed as I 'm not getting the full transfer , will replace the router	1
We originally purchased our unit through Amazon , but after one week the unit failed . We opted to have the unit replaced through ARRIS/Motorola directly . This unit has been running smoothly for 2+ months now . We 're running about 50+ MPS .	1
I was having trouble with my cox internet speed . This solved the problem . I now get 15 mbps upload and about 25+mbps download standard throughout the house , worth the investment	1
This is the modem that they try to get you to rent ! It is a future proof investment that will be able to handle speed increases in the future.Be confident in your investment that you will not need to purchase another modem for the foreseeable future.Cheers , BSR	1
When I received a one-page , four-point font one-liner from TW Oceanic Cable that my ( already exorbitant ) bill would be rising by another $ 6.00 / month if I did n't replace their modem with one I purchased , it did n't take long for me to start a serious search to preclude this otherwise eventuality . This modem is DOCSIS 3.0 , but is not a wireless modem . The difference in specs between this wired model and the next model up in the current Motorola SurfBoard line is insignificant with the exception of the wireless capabilities afforded by the more expensive model . Since I already have an Apple Airport Extreme that I use for the WLAN in the house , I did n't see a need to fork over nearly twice the price of this model for the wireless one ( everyone 's case is different , of course ) . This model accomplishes all my goals ; it 's fast , ( thus far ) reliable , and has potential for expansion ( it can supposedly support much faster download / upload service than I currently pay my cable provider for ) .	1
Rather than pay the rental on a Comcast modem , I wanted to buy my own cable modem . The SurfBoard SB6141 was one of the Comcast approved DOCSIS 3.0 modems . I read and took to heart the recommendations to buy the white modem and not the black modem to avoid problems with activation . The installation is very simple . Twist on the cable , plug in the ethernet cable to your computer and plug in the power adapter . I had set up activation in advance with Comcast when I went into the service center to get a splitter and return the cable modem they had sent me in error ( Why I got the cable modem is a whole other story about incompetence of their online chat reps. ) On the day of activation , I plugged the ethernet cable from the modem directly into my desktop , opened the browser and typed in [ ... ] address . Comcast asked for a log in and , once I entered it , Comcast began to program the modem and setup my account . It took more than a few minutes . I had to close and reopen the browser to complete the setup.Getting it to work on my home wifi network , required a bit of trial and error as the Netgear wifi router could n't see the Internet at first . I shutdown the router and modem . I then turned on the router first and then the modem . After that , everything worked.No issues in the few hours it 's been running . I 'll update my review if any problems crop up . ****Update March 16 , 2014****After running with no issues on the first day , connection issues began to crop up after 8 pm . About every 5 minutes , the modem would lose the connection . That night I decided to see if the issue was the modem or my cable connection . I left the modem powered on , but not connected via coax cable or ethernet . The next morning I connected via ethernet to my desktop and checked the modem status . It had been running all night without interruption . At this point , I thought the problem was the cable connection because the existing coax is RG-59 with splices and over 20 years old . I removed the splitter from coax out of the wall and directly connected to the modem . After a few times recycling the modem , the signal was better and it worked without interruption for almost 12 hours until about midnight . Speeds were high and the lag when clicking on links was noticeably less.After this experience , I think that the modem is relatively sensitive to noise on the line . I think that I 'll have a new line run to the room just for the modem and a separate line for the TV . ****Update March 19 , 2014****I opted to replace about 30 feet of cable that was made up of three separate pieces of cable and that was easily accessible . The replacement cable was shielded RG-6 that the Comcast guy had left years ago and only needed to be about 8 feet long . I reconnected the splitter between the modem and TV , too . Once all that was done , I have only recorded 1 reboot due to errors in the past four days . ( I rebooted twice when I was disconnecting and reconnecting cables . ) It has been running without interruption for the past 2 days . Based on my experience , I 'd recommend that before getting a cable modem you have your coaxial cable checked out first or replaced . In my case , it would have saved days of frustration.One other point . The lights are relatively bright on the front panel . I 'd cover them with electrical tape . If you use a color other than black , you might still be able to see which lights are lit . ****Update May 16 , 2014****The modem has been working mostly flawlessly for two months . The last manual reboot was 18 days ago . I think that manually rebooting the modem every so often has cleared up any issue that might arise for me . And issues are very rare .	1
Ok , so what more can I say about the 6141 . This is everything one would expect from Motorola . It 's also very compact and the white body and design are sweet.I would buy it again for surr	1
One month into installation and the modem seems to work flawlessly . No drop in signal and I 'm getting all the internet speed I pay for and them some ! I used to use the comcast supplied modem , but I figured why pay them an extra $ 7 a month ? This modem performs just as well or better as the surfboard sb6121 model .	1
Modem installed and initialized with TWC just fine and started working well right off the bat ... got tired of lease price going up or even being charged a lease price when we did n't pay one when we signed on and got the old modem from TWC . Now Motorola can pay for itself and then cut our costs after that.Just do n't expect to see more speed out of your Internet by using this DOCSIS 3.0 modem unless you have higher than basic internet service.To compare , on our basic service TW customer service says 15Mbs download and 1Mbs upload is normal max.Of course you will be ready to upgrade your internet service with this 3.0 if and when the time comes and that is a good Ace in the hole for later.Others are correct , the white case front glows with the bright LEDs so be ready to cover them up a bit or turn the face to the wall etc . I found several layers of regular masking tape dulled them down enough to keep them out of my peripheral vision when room is dim . If you do n't want to see LEDs at all , you can just stick a ball of poster putty on them and it 's dense enough to block them out .	1
Terrific ! Quick and easy to set up and use . Gives a clear and easy to understand indication of status	1
Works great	1
fast and stable internet . no sudden disconnection has occurred so far . ..used it for comcast , set up was easy too ,	1
Bought this on behalf of a school district Tech department . I have not heard anything negative , so I am assuming that it was a good purchase .	1
Purchased this instead of paying TWC monthly rental fee for one of their recycled modems.Had no issues installing or setting it up with their system . Have not had a single glitch or hiccup and have n't even had to reboot it once since installation months ago.As a bonus these are easily resold for most of your money back if you ever need to get rid of it for some reason . Which is the reason I purchased a factory new unit .	1
I bought this modem so I could stop paying a $ 7/month lease fee to my cable provider . It works great so far , no problems in my 1600-sq-ft house . It integrated seamlessly with my existing router .	1
After previously raving on other Mediabridge products , I find that this cable is less than stellar.I purchased the & # 34 ; Charging-Only & # 34 ; cable so that I could obtain maximum charging speed when connected to my after-market wall or car chargers . This cable does not allow me to do that.The speed that a wall or car charger juices up your device depends on the Output listed on the charging unit 's label . The 5V or & # 34 ; Voltage & # 34 ; listed there is a USB standard , but it 's the second number you want to pay particular attention to : the Amperage , signified as A or mA ( milliAmp ) . With all other things being equal , the higher the Amperage - the faster the charge.The rub is the charger does n't decide how much electricity to send , but rather the device itself that PULLS electricity from the AC plug or USB port . All Android-based devices will limit the energy draw to a maximum of about 500mA ( or of a full Amp ) when connected to a USB port . Most aftermarket chargers follow the USB data standard that includes 4 & # 34 ; pins & # 34 ; within a connector - 2 for power-charging and 2 for data-transfer ( meaning your device recognizes it as a USB port ) ; whereas most OEM chargers usually have the data pins & # 34 ; shorted & # 34 ; so the device sees only charging pins , thus indicating a power-charger and allowing itself to draw the maximum current . It 's fairly complicated and counter-intuitive at first , and it took me a long time to find out why my devices were charging so slowly on a supposedly fast after-market charger . This is demonstrable by the very chargers Amazon itself sells ... theAmazon Kindle 9W PowerFast Adapter for Accelerated Chargingcosts more - but you 'll only get up to 1.8A output no matter which cable used since they have effectively killed the data pins on the charger ; whereas they also sell the better valueAmazonBasics Wall Charger with USB Outlet ( 2.1 Amp Output ) with its higher output , but it has all 4 USB pins intact - so unless you have a good charging-only cable the most you will ever draw at any time from it is around 500mA . You absolutely need a good charging-only cable to take advantage of the faster speed provided by the higher output of most aftermarket chargers.This Mediabridge USB Charging Cable does n't consistently work to fast-charge every Android device due to the manufacturing technique used . I 'm not sure why Mediabridge is selling this as a charging-only cable since it does n't work to Fast-Charge Android devices if the wall charger does n't have the data pins shorted . Basically this cable will not charge your device fast unless the charger supports it by shorting the data pins , and this also does not transfer data files.PortaPow manufactures the best charging-only cable I 've been able to find consistently on Amazon ( or anywhere ) . ThePortaPow Specialised 5ft 24AWG Charge Only Micro USB Cable for Blackberry , Xperia , HTC One , Google Nexus , Other Fast Charging Devicesis seemingly fast-charging compatible with 100 % of Android devices and aftermarket wall chargers because they use Resistors ( which is technical but see the information on the product page to learn more ) . With the PortaPow Charge-Only Micro-USB Cable , finally I am able to charge my many Android devices with all my aftermarket wall and car chargers at their highest rated output.If you have purchased an aftermarket charger and wondered why it did n't seem to juice your device very fast , or just does n't seem to be living up to its full potential - thePortaPow Specialised 5ft 24AWG Charge Only Micro USB Cable for Blackberry , Xperia , HTC One , Google Nexus , Other Fast Charging Devicescharging-only cable is likely what you need , rather than this Mediabridge basic cable ( which I found to be a waste of money ) .	-1

I purchased this to replace one that had no bass sound and this one sounds identical . What a huge disappointment . It reminds me of the radios we had in cars back in the 60 's . The bass boost button does almost nothing . I use it at fairly low volume , but even my cheap computer speakers have better bass response .	-1
I already bought a Ipad a few years ago ( Ipad 1 ) and this looks and performs exactally the same . My eyeballs are unable to tell the difference in retina or no retina display on a 10 '' tablet LOL Most who would I think are simply lying . This has the exact look , features , crappy OS and shackling to Itunes as the Ipad I already have , there is no incentive or need to buy this . Im amazed how how much Apple can recycle it 's products , add nothing of value , put a letter next to the version number ( Iphone 3gs/4s/5s ) or up the number ( 1/2/3/4/mini ) and call it a new device plus charge a bloated price for it like it is a fully new device ... ..but their cultists buy it ?	-1
I just discovered that this device will not print to my wifi enabled printer a Canon MX882 . Now I 'm stuck .

I have the Monster Turbine Copper Pro for over 2 years now , and the ControlTalk was acting funny . Since I like the fit of the Copper Pro and its sound signature , I decided to grab the DNA when it was on sale over the holidays , hoping that the DNA would be decent . I was wrong . Right out of the box , the DNA sounded & # 34 ; muffled & # 34 ; and distant . After a 10-hour burn-in , the & # 34 ; muffled & # 34 ; sound improved a bit , but the bass was loose , & # 34 ; muddy & # 34 ; , and bled freely into the recessed midrange . I was not sure if I got a bad copy , but I lost hope and returned the DNA.Also , the Control Talk was very stiff , requiring extra effort or double presses to change tracks or volume.On a more positive note , the fit was excellent for my ears ( similar to Copper Pro but lighter ) .	-1
Live in a poured concrete home ( rental ) so limited flexibility with main router location . This worked well and and created a VERY fast connection to the downstairs computer . The problem is that it intermittently blocks the upstairs router making upstairs wifi unreliable . Additionally , we have downstairs Powerline adapter hard wired to computer . When my wife or daughter connects to Powerline through wifi , it actually disconnects the wired connection to PC . Only one single connection is supported . All in all , really about useless . It went back today .	-1

Bought this for my iPad mini and loved it until I used it for watching movies . I would have to set up movies before opening and setting this up to watch them . If there is any touching of the screen while it is propped up on itself it falls over . Made it about a week , it is going back . I would not recommend .	-1
It did n't work with my iPad with retinal screen . I got an error message from iOS stating that it 's not compatible . I returned it without too much hassle .	-1
I guess like others it did n't work . And yes I do know how to slide the card in to lock it in place . To check it out this one was just a bad one I went to Bestbuys and that one worked fine . I wanted to make sure the other one was dead . Now the only problem is returning it to get a refund . Amazon takes care of this but this company wants you to go buy a shipping box and pay to have it returned . This wo n't happen again . Plus they also charge a 15 % restocking fee . By the time you do all of that you might as well take the loss .	-1

I have tried and tried to get this to work . I never got my iPad 3 to connect . One of my phones HTC DNA connected a few times but every time I have to play with it to get it to connect . My Samsung Note 3 wo n't connect just gets an error . I finally got the Bose SoundLink Bluetooth but would still like to use my SoundDock . I just wanted people to know . I count on Amazon reviews a lot . I 've had it for several months but am giving up on it .	-1
Poor quality materials but it works more or less . You get bluetooth but the audio is not high quality ( part of that is the technology of bluetooth , which was never made for music ) and because its made of cheap plastic I doubt it will last long . Probably better ones out there for sure .	-1
Product arrives defective , with only one channel working . Pushing the detatchable headphone line in at the headset end was a temporary fix for a few seconds , then it would go back out . I suspect the detachable cord plug in base ( female end ) on the headset was defective . Refunded and decided against trying a new one .	-1
Since majority of the headphones are made of plastic , these feel very plasticy and cheap . The plastic on the side of the headphone are very prone to fingerprints . I probably would n't have purchase these if there were more review on it because i brought them when they first came out . The sound quality is okay , but the bands are very tight . I can only listen with them for a few minutes before taking them off because they hear by ear . The packaging is also horrible . It came it a box that was not taped closed and there were scratches on the box itself .	-1
AppRadio is a mess that you should stay far far away from . First- to use AppRadio you need the $ 50 VGA-Lightning-Adapter and the cables to plug into it ( my stereo [ Avh-3600bhs ] uses CD-IV203 ) . Second- for convenience you need a female lightning to male lightning straight though cord to extend the dongle to your dashboard . That cost me $ 127 . Okay- sounds expensive- but wait ... ... .Once you buy everything- You 'll notice that AppRadio requires you to use Bluetooth-audio-to-stereo . That 's because the Vga-lightning-adapter DOES NOT transmit DATA or AUDIO to the stereo ; Only video goes to the stereo . You 're phone only gets charged and does not end up sending audio or meta-data to the stereo . So- from now on : Pandora on your stereo has NO ALBUM ART and metadata such as track name is passed though bluetooth ( takes 5 seconds or so ) to show on the stereo . Also- thumbs up and next-a-song takes several seconds to register . But even all this can be overlooked ... ... But then you notice AppRadio crashes , AppRadio lags , AppRadio does n't even work hardly at all if Pandora or bluetooth-audio- is playing in the background . On the phone side- & # 34 ; AppRadio iphone app & # 34 ; must be actively open on the phone . You ca n't use it in the background ; doing so only crashes everything for 45-60 seconds . So you start to think everything might be okay with AppRadio if you do n't touch it while its working and leave it for the long trip ... .Well it is n't . Because the apps for AppRadio have adds/popups . And those adds/popups do n't actually display correctly on the Pioneer stereo because the viewing size is slightly off . So eventually- you will be driving along and a popup will make your entire stereo frozen- that you ca n't click on the popup because its & # 34 ; not the active & # 34 ; screen and AppRadio is a buggy . Lastly- just keep in mind- that all those potential clicks you make in AppRadio- are communicating though Bluetooth so each one takes a couple seconds to register.If you intend to use this for the Pioneer AppRadio just know that data and audio will not go though the adapter . You 'll be using Bluetooth for those functions .	-1
If your cable is direct , this unit will not do timed program recording . You must have a cable box . It 's nearly impossible to find quality DVR equipment unless you are willing to pay one or more subscriptions for services you do n't want .

Simple and to the point . This is not about the camera , but about the vendor . I received the FZ200 from Another Deal Site today and it is a grey market version . No USA charger , no USA warranty , no USA documentation . If I wanted a grey market version , I would have KNOWINGLY purchased a grey market version . Unless I 'm missing something in the description from Another Deal Site , I did not knowingly purchase a grey market version . Luckily it was purchased using Amazon Prime so that I will not be penalized for Another Deal Site 's deception and I can return it without penalty .	-1

When I ordered this keyboard , the product description stated in two places that it had a TAB key , and the product pictures also showed a TAB key . However , the delivered keyboard had none . This makes the keyboard largely useless for general typing , filling out forms , website sign-in , etc . It has a mysteriously large Q key instead . Apparently there is some obscure world language that uses q 's in almost every word ... I see that the product description has now changed , and that it no longer promises a TAB key .	-1
I wanted to love this MiniSuit keyboard , but quickly found it had design and ergonomics faults which rendered it useless for me . Its actual keys have a strange shiny & # 34 ; pebbled & # 34 ; texture that reflects glare from typical room lighting and makes them very hard to see . If I dim the lights , the thin , gray print on the keys is still hard to see . My Logitech bluetooth iPad keyboard is far easier to use because its keys were designed properly.Consider the ergonomics of typing : Normal touch-typing ( in which your fingers are spread apart ) is not feasible on the narrow MiniSuit . On a keyboard this cramped , you tend to bunch your fingers together and resort to two-finger poking ... which works fine for the on-screen keyboard when the Nexus 7 is upright . But when the horizontal MiniSuit keyboard is used , all those bunched , unused fingers dangle down and scatter unwanted typos in your text . I 'm not a real touch-typist but have managed decently for half a century with fast four-finger poking , and at times I DO need to look at the keys.In general , the MiniSuit is barely larger than the on-screen keyboard so its chief virtues are portability and use as a hard-shell case for the Nexus 7 . For any serious typing chores , I suggest one of Amazon 's many other bluetooth keyboards which are about 11 inches wide.TIP : If you REALLY want to do a lot of text input on the handy Nexus 7 ... add a portable keyboard and a mouse ! The Nexus easily pairs with a standard bluetooth mouse and displays a black arrow cursor for navigation . Clicking , double-clicking , and the scroll wheel perform so much like precise finger-touches you 'll be amazed . You can select , drag , execute , etc . as if on a full-sized desktop PC . When finished , stick the Nexus 7 in your ( large ) pocket and walk away : ^ )	-1
After a few months of use the imprinted letters on the keyboard started to wear off . I am a two fingered typist so soon this keyboard will not be so useful to me because I type by looking at the keyboard . That cancels out any of the other advantages that this keyboard has to offer .	-1
While this cover does fit with the Smart Cover , one thing I did n't think of is that the magnet that holds it to the back when open wo n't work . Meaning when the Smart Cover is folded back and you are using it , the Smart Cover just flops around , and does n't stay connected to the back . Makes it a little strange.Second issue is that it is so slippery . I think I have a better chance of dropping it now than I did without it on . I 'm thinking about putting some tacky tape or stickers with some grip , but thought I would n't need to.Third thing , and the deal breaker , it 's almost impossible to use the volume buttons . I have to press way too hard to get the volume to change .	-1
The reviews are right on , this is a very nice case . Great materials , sturdy , nice feel , etc . however the case I received does n't like to stay closed . I was hoping this case would solve my problem of having a folio without needing a piece of elastic to keep it closed , but I guess not . Returned as defective.Update : When I contacted SwitchEasy support to see if I received a defective case based on the description of the problem they were less than helpful . They offered to `` verify '' sellers , but then would n't confirm or deny if a product sold and shipped by amazon ( no third party seller involvement ) fell under this category and wanted a copy of a receipt or invoice to answer this simple question.I will not be purchasing any SwitchEasy products in the future .	-1
I am a swim instructor and I purchased this case so I can walk around the pool and take video or photo of my clients . This part the case does alright . I find it really annoying that I need to purchase an adapter to charge the iPad . So far I feel that the price I paid ( 129.99 ) does not justify the additional expense of having to purchase an adapter . So instead , I have to pry the case open with a coin just to be able to charge it . The case is showing wear and tear from this.So I would not really recommend the product and I would advise Lifeproof to change the design around the charging end or to provide the adapter . As it stands I am very disappointed .	-1
ONLY buy this if you MUST have a fully water/dust proof case ! ! ! Its a great product for what it really is and really admire the o-ring design but this is not for the very large majority of people . I use my iPad for GPS in an open off road vehicle in heavy dust and rain so perfect for me but gave it a low review as this product is pushed heavily to the mainstream users when it should not be : - Speaker is muffled and at least 25 % less sound and loose some serious fidelity- The Nuud idea of no screen protector is a cool thought but I really think all of us want some screen protection especially at this price point and cost of an iPad . Atleast it does come with the snap on face cover but its really only practical for storage in my opinion . Weird that when removed it wont snap ontot he backside of the case so its an extra loose item to carry around . It also has a built in kickstand and thus doubles as a stand so that is nice but still not well thought out as only good for landscape orientation . Expect a lot more at this price point in general.- Only OEM charger will fit ... had to buy adapters for all my chargers and most do n't fit and need to be modified- The door design for charger makes it a little tricky ( you get use to it ) to insert the charger- My headphones wont plug in by simply removing the waterproof plug ( which is a bit annoying in general ) . have to use the adapter to make contact properly so its another thing dangling off the case which is annoying.- Very bulky but good quality- SUPER Expensive ... throw in a good NUUD screen protector film custom cut ( Zagg ) to maintain waterproof and getting way up as cant use a standard film screen protectorWas hoping I could tolerate this case to still use it for work also when I do n't need waterproof and tried to get use to it but I am going to a standard cover/case for normal use . Really surprised how many of these have sold and are pushed heavily in the big box stores too ... it should be a niche only product .	-1
Punch is fine , but I was missing pieces ; namely the metal adapter tray for punching Micro > Nano . The box was in bad shaped and was opened in a sealed envelope .

I 'm usually a fan of Otterbox , I 've owned several of their defender cases ( for both iPhone and iPad ) and was eagerly awaiting this one to protect my iPad Mini . However when the case arrived I thought I had been sent a counterfeit as it was such poor materials and workmanship.Stay away .	-1

Well I read all reviews and I am surprised that so many of these are actually good . I guess the people did not compare to other brand . I do compare to 1978 model Technics SB4000 linear phase speaker system which has 45-20kHz , 90 db sensitivity , 2 way . Is turned out that Technics are much much better in sound much clear bass and great mid range so I am returning polks asap . Very disappointed of polls which sond murky .	-1
Have you heard ? Because I didn't.I bought this because the word 'Paste ' was right there in the title of the product : & # 34 ; Polysynthetic Gold Thermal Compound Paste 1.0g Tube & # 34 ; It 's not a good paste -- even heated up and dried , this stuff would have trouble holding your attention , much less anything else you throw at it ( better said , 'use it to hold in place ' ) .This stuff is way too viscous , and in way too small an amount , to ship out in the ridiculously long plunger they send it in.It 's a terrible product , a waste of money and time , and you should stay away from it until the seller quits watering it down with Thousand Island ( or spit ) , or at least changes the item listing to use the word 'Product ' instead of 'Paste'.You know -- in the same way nasty-cheap hot dog makers use the word 'Product ' -- loosely , to cover something up that 'll make you sick .	-1
UPDATE after 2 months use : This case hold my Kindle with four elastic straps at the corners . After a couple months use they have started to release with increased frequency . It 's a question of which comes first , I replace the case with something that holds more reliably or the Kindle slips on , hits the floor , and I get to update my Kindle review with the results of a 3 ' drop . Now , back to my original , and otherwise mostly positive , review ... What I like : The `` standing up '' feature is simplicity in itself . The flaps that fold out from the inside cover provide two convenient angles . The first angle is mostly vertical and would be useful for watching videos . The second is mostly horizontal and useful for when you want to type . When not `` deployed '' both flaps are held against the cover by hidden magnets . Some covers I 've used rely on the device pivoting away from the back cover and resting in groves on the inside front . Not only does that represent additional moving parts but it makes having the device set at an angle for typing impossible.The cover has a nice , embossed leather-like look and a slightly suede-like feel . Aside for giving it some `` character '' it makes it a bit less slippery and easier to hang on to . Other covers I 've used are smooth and possibly real leather . They seem a bit more difficult to hang on to and are certainly less distinctive.The `` patent-pending corner elastics '' seem to provide a surprisingly secure fit . In particular I have not seen the slipping issue mentioned by previous reviewers and perhaps the manufacturer made some adjustments from that early feedback ? They also make it simple to remove my Kindle if I should ever want to . Some covers use snap-in frames . My experience with them is that the device can sometimes pop out when you do n't want it to and be very difficult to remove when you do.It looks like the cover will provide good overall protection . The front cover , the one that is against the display , is quite rigid . There is a 1/4 '' margin around all edges so if I drop it and it lands on an edge the cover will take the impact.That I did n't like so much : The cover when it arrived had a bit of a chemical smell . It seems to have dissipated over the past week and now I only notice it if I hold the case close to my nose.What I discovered : There 's an elastic strap on the back flap that is intended to loop over the front flap and keep the cover closed . If I fold the front flap all the way back and then put the elastic strap over it then I can slip my hand between them and it stays on , kind of like a glove ... more like a mitten ... but with no separate place for my thumb . That makes it easy for me to hang onto my Kindle with one hand .	-1
Having used this case for a little while now , I thought I would share some pros and cons with you ( the potential buyer ) ... Pros : -I really LOVE that Verso uses elastic straps . I am not a fan of magnetic closures . I think the Moleskine-look is much more appealing than the tab closures.-SUPER lightweight . It adds virtually nothing to the weight of your Kindle.-Innovative design ! The manner in which the case folds is one I have never seen before ... and , it certainly works for me.-Elastic straps tightly hold the Kindle in-place and allow for a quick switch-out of cases.Cons : -There is a powerful odor emanating from the case . When I initially removed this case from the shipping materials , the smell was overwhelming . Now , that it has set out on my nightstand for a day , the odor is slightly less noticeable.-The material is an extremely slippery satin ( ? ) . In just one day , I have dropped the case into my lap twice . Since there is no padding to this case , I do worry what would happen if I were walking around with this case and it slid from my hands . ( I have been trying to hold it by the spine since that area is a different material and much easier to grip . ) -The interior is not the super soft micro-fiber that Verso fans know . It is relatively hard material . ( However , I have a screen protector on my Kindle , so I am not worried . ) If you are sensitive to odors , this case may be problematic for you . Likewise , if you are `` klutzy '' ( like me ) , the slippery satiny exterior may also pose a problem . Nonetheless , the case is pretty and elegant !	-1
I 'm perplexed by this cover and stand for Kindle Fire HD 8.9 . It 's made by Marware , which makes good covers , but this one does n't come up to their usual standards . It 's a flimsy cover that is n't comfortable to hold while reading books and magazines on Kindle Fire 8.9 , and the stand is poorly designed so that it tends to fall over if jostled at all . The front cover has a fold down the front to enable you to fold it into a stand , but this makes it awkward to use as a cover for reading on Kindle . The cover leaves all the controls and ports uncovered , but the power button is very small to begin with and this cover comes right up to the edge of it and gets in the way when you want to press the power button . I can not recommend this cover which is overpriced and unattractive . For a lower list price you can get theMarware Vibe Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 8.9 '' which has a better stand , is comfortable to hold , and even turns on the Kindle 's power when you open the cover .	-1
Not a completely horrible product , but it does n't stand up to the manufacturer 's claims , and as such , should have been priced a lot less than it was.The following are the manufacturer 's claims as advertised on AMAZON , followed by my observations / comments : Manufacturer Statement # 1 : & # 34 ; Convenient Port Access - Stylish synthetic leather case provides full access to the HDMI and charging ports . Simply insert the device with the ports facing outward and the four-point mounting system secures it inside the case & # 34 ; My observations / comments on statement # 1 : a : & # 34 ; Stylish synthetic leather case & # 34 ; = accurate statement . Yes , it looks very nice.b : & # 34 ; full access to the HDMI and charging ports & # 34 ; = inaccurate statement ( i.e . the manufacturer lied , as this is actually quite INCONVENIENT ) . If you put your Kindle into this case straight-up ( as you would suspect you should ) , then the charging port is actually covered by the spine of the case , and if you & # 34 ; insert the device with the ports facing outward & # 34 ; as suggested by the manufacturer , then your Kindle is upside-down & the camera is focusing up your nose ( not so pleasant for onlookers ) .Manufacturer Statement # 2 : & # 34 ; Stands In Multiple Angles - Case stands your device in virtually any viewing angle on the non-slip interior of the front lid. & # 34 ; My observations / comments on # 2 : & # 34 ; Stands In Multiple Angles & # 34 ; = inaccurate statement ( i.e . the manufacturer lied .. I think ) . If the manufacturer thinks that & # 34 ; virtually any viewing angle & # 34 ; means flat , then they did n't lie , since , no matter what angle you start at , it will s l o w l y but surely ALWAYS slide all the way down flat ( heck , who knows what the true definition of & # 34 ; non-slip & # 34 ; is anyway ? ) Manufacturer Statement # 3 : & # 34 ; Sleep/Wake Lid - Soft magnets in lid automatically power device on or off. & # 34 ; My observations / comments on # 3 : & # 34 ; Sleep/Wake Lid & # 34 ; = inaccurate statement ( i.e . the manufacturer lied ... sometimes ) My Kindle only occasionally turns on OR off by opening / closing the lid . ( oh , wait ... maybe if I put my Kindle in the case upside down so I can plug it in , then also maybe the 'soft magnets ' will work ! ... wait a minute , let me check ... nahh ... that did n't work , now it does n't turn on or off at all ) .Manufacturer Statement # 4 : & # 34 ; Convenient Elastic Strap - For added convenience and protection , an elastic strap secures the case open or closed. & # 34 ; My observations / comments on # 4 : & # 34 ; Convenient Elastic Strap & # 34 ; = accurate statement .. WOW that IS convenient ( are n't rubber bands amazing ? ) This thing will work , if you do n't mind fussing with all of the aforementioned issues.Overall not too pleased with this case .	-1
It was shipped and received in a timely manner , no damage to the box or anything of the sort , however the tablet was defective , right out of the box . There 's only static on the screen and the resets as per online guides were of no use . This is pathetic . Organized a return the very next day ( today ) after receiving it .	-1
In the past month , I have owned two beautiful , zippy , but ultimately defective Nexus 7's.The first worked very well for about three weeks . I enjoyed it . It handled everything I threw at it , the screen was vibrant , the battery life surprisingly good , etc . Then one day it had a meltdown . Understand , I was very gentle with this thing . I never put it loose in a bag or dropped it or even set it down hard , so I was quite surprised to turn it on and see the screen go haywire ( I 'd describe it as multicolored snow . ) It never recovered and I was forced to return it . I then bought a replacement from my local OfficeMax , and it did the SAME THING right out of the box . If you google `` Nexus 7 Wo n't Turn On , '' you 'll see that unfortunately this is a common problem . The factory reset does nothing , and if you open the back to poke around , you 'll void your warranty . I can only assume that it has some serious hardware issues , and until these are addressed , I 'll be trying my luck with another tablet .	-1
After much research , I decided that the Asus Nexus was the best choice for a tablet . Since this was my first tablet I looked forward to the day it would arrive . My excitement turned quickly to disappointment as I learned I had a faulty unit . From the first moment I turned it on , it would n't work right . I would have to tap the screen over and over and over again to activate it , and then I would end up somewhere other than where I had wanted to go . The more I tried to maneuver my way through its programs , the worse it got . I 'm glad I purchased it through Amazon though , because the seller had a good return policy , and all I had to do was print out a return label and drop it off at UPS , postage paid . After reading what others went through trying to deal with Asus directly , I would never buy another product from Asus unless the seller had a fair return policy .	-1
If your life is all about watching movies , listening to music , & reading recreational literature , and you 're happy to get all your content from online sources , then you 'll definitely want to consider this tablet : it has a nice form factor , a nice screen , is plenty quick enough , and is reasonably inexpensive . And you can tweet and find the closest Starbuck 's or Costa 's on it to boot , though given the form factor you will of course have to hunt and peck . Its major limitation is the rather scanty 32GB of internal storage , not much even by media player standards ( more on that below ) .If , on the other hand , you have actual work to do , and want to use this device as a tablet computer , you 'll probably be unhappy with it . The really big problems are the 32GB internal storage , lack of an SD card slot and the exclusive use of the MTP/PTP protocols for USB access to that internal storage , with consequently severe constraints on the ability to synchronize your own files to/from this tablet to any other machine . The first two might have been bearable ( which was my calculation when buying the device ) , but the third ( discovered only after my purchase ) turns these limitations into a handicap . There are partial solutions to the problem ( e.g . Nexus Media Importer , Dropbox , Stickmount , Samba , MTP mounting and a few MTP synch utilities , etc . ) , but many of them are tediously interactive ( i.e . resistant to programming/scripting ) , none of them are completely satisfactory , and the less inadequate ones will all require rooting the device.I 'm using Samba & Stickmount and thanks to FunkyFresh and Chainfire can probably live with it for a while , but I must say my encounter with the Asus/Google Nexus 7 has started me wondering about getting an actual tablet computer like Microsoft Surface or some other device that has been designed to support more than personal entertainment . In the meantime , I do n't foresee decomissioning my Vaio anytime soon.Update : Rating revised to two stars . I 'm replacing the Google/Asus device with a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8 that has SD Card extended storage . The whole Asus/Google MTP/PTP emulated `` SDCard '' business just got too limiting/cumbersome/confusing/annoying to want to live with any longer . I do n't plan on buying any future internal storage only devices from Google/Asus or any other vendor .	-1
I am an Apple device user , not because I am a fanboy or shareholder , or no other bias , but just because since the day I moved from Win Vista to Mac OSX , and iPhone , my life became less cluttered , and less of headaches . Last year when Nexus 7 was announced , I realized that there is some `` spark '' in this tablet and it hit the right spot where I can carry this device in my jacket , giving me exact balance of portability and size . In last 12 months , I went through 3 of these devices , and here is the breakdown . ( the only reason I kept on buying them was due to its right size , iPad mini is bigger for what I would carry ) 1 . Original 16 Gig , 250 $ N7 , came with a squeaky glass . It worked fine but the sqeaky glass always scared me , when will this thing fall apart ? Sold it , to upgrade to Cellular N7 , and to get rid of the squeaky glass.2 . Cellular 32 Gig , N7 . Worked fine till 2 months later , the speakers died . Google play messed up replacement , refused to send another device and refused to give my money back . Credit Card company had to intervene to rescue my money . ( I am not buying anything from Google play , their support is horrendous , and the staff manners are unheard of ) 3 . WiFi 16 Gig N7 , 200 $ , from Office Max . Similar story , 2 months into using , Missed touch inputs , USB cable breakdown , occasional tablet freezes , getting hot on its back , occasional unsolicited restarts . Sold it again.None of my devices were manhandled or dropped . They were treated with same care and dignity as rest of Apple devices.I am not comparing contents on Apple and Google ecosystems , as what I need is universally available . I think it is more of an ASUS issue than Google , but if Google is going to use low quality hardware to keep prices low to capture market from Apple , who always deliver quality products , I think Google is liable as well.Compare this to my 3 year old iMac , 2 year old iPad , I never had any such issues with them . They Just Work .	-1
The two viewing options are sometimes difficult to get situated with , especially when watching a show . Also , it gets very dirty very fast . I had been using it for a day ( kept in my purse without other crap filling it up ) and when I took it out it had scraps and marks all over it . It does n't look to fantastic now .	-1
The back was okay , but the cover seemed flimsy and cheap , almost like a paper product . This seems uncharacteristic of the Marware I remember . I went to the other extreme and bought Apple 's product instead .	-1
Actually , I do n't like it much.I really hate the way it 's laid out . Makes using the keyboard difficult , however it seems all computers these days have the same basic design . Windows 8 and 8.1 suck ( go back to 7 , except you can not ) . HP always comes packed with so much junk as well . I should have stuck to Samsung . Oh well , live and learn . I can not recommend this computer for anyone except those that check their emails once a week .	-1
This thing looked awesome online.. its specs are all impressive . The computer its self is beautiful . -But that 's where the praise stops.Listen this thing is a huge pile of s***.. i can not even watch a 5 minute youtube video without so much stopping to buffer that i want to rip the hair from my head ! ! This was a huge waste of $ 600 and I honestly want my money back ! I HATE this computer I wish that I had bought any other computer than this one ! My 2005 Gateway desktop can run circles around this brand new HP pavillion ! This computer is worse than a doorstop because atleast a doorstop doesnt cost $ 600 and piss you off all day ! WORST purchase from amazon EVER . do not buy this crap , do yourself a favor !	-1
They did n't redesign this for the newer iPad mini retina , so it does n't really fit the new thicker design . So you might want to wait for a case with a better fit .	-1
Very disappointing . The triangular stand function does not work at all . When you try to stand the iPad , the triangular shape collapses . It also exposes the edges of the iPad too much . I am returning this .	-1
The adhesive on the cover did n't do so well , it started to peel after a while and it only got worse .	-1
This was a great case . It was thin , provided excellent protection and looked good . After the first two or three days , the smart cover started falling apart a little at a time . Today ( two months later ) , it is halfway off and I ca n't get a replacement from Amazon.Amazon fail and Product fail . Stay away .	-1
The installation instructions that came with the protectors instructed me to wet the screen of the tablet , and , then apply the wet protector to the already wet screen . I do n't want water anywhere near my tablet !	-1
This did n't work for the Galaxy Note or Galaxy Note 2 . Not sure if it worked at all . Buyer beware .	-1
This device worked with my Samsung Galaxy S3 , but there was a loose connection in the wires internally where the MHL cable connects to the box . This caused loss of audio and often loss of the picture . If you did n't breathe on it and did n't get a notification on your phone then it was fine .	-1
Did n't want to pay north of $ 30 for an HDMI cable for my S3 , so I bought this one thinking it would work fine and I would n't need another HDMI cable . It worked great for about 30 seconds , until I moved my phone and lost the signal . The slightest movement of the cable at the base of the phone would cause the signal to go in and out . If I set it in the right place it would work for a few minutes , then lose the signal again . I double and triple checked every connection , and yes I did connect power . I 've had no issues with charging my phone and there is nothing loose on my phone ( it 's only 3 weeks old ) . Simply moving the cable where it goes into the plug would cause the issue . My guess is this cable is sourced from some cable factory in China with poor quality . That means you could take a chance and get a good cable I guess , but I had bad luck with this one . This garbage cable is going back . Save yourself the headache and buy the Samsung cable . At the time of this review it was only $ 13 more.UPDATE : Bought the original Samsung adapter from Verizon and it works perfectly . You get what you pay for .	-1
I mainly wanted this for all the newer style video output devices , it seemed to work somewhat for my s3 . The image quality wasnt nothing you could watch a video off of , and it seemed to only work with my S3 . Tried with my Nexus 7 and it didnt work . I used it the first day and it remains in a box till this day . Could work to see images but not much else , and a charger was used .	-1
I tried both a Galaxy S4 and a Note 2 using two different TVs , checking connections , inputs , rebooting phones , and could never get it to work , although both phones sensed the power and showed that they were charging . Tried various sequences of connecting , with TVs initially off and then on , USB power connected or not , toggling HDMI back and forth on each TV : nothing . I made absolutely sure that the plugs were inserted all the way . Possibly a defective unit , so I just returned it and will try something different . Too bad - this was a feature I used a lot on my Motorola Droid Bionic , my previous phone .	-1
The screen protector fits okay and the price is right but it scratches too easily . I would spend a little more and get a better quality item .	-1
the unit worked ok for about 7 months as described . went to charge it this evening and it wont charge any more.do n't know if its the charger or the unit.uses a proprietary charging port . they should have used micro usb instead .	-1
I have 3 RooCaes for the iPad Mini 's Loved them and they work well . So when it came time to get 2 cases for my sons for Christmas for their new iPods . They simply do n't work . When my sons went to turn the iPod off it did n't work . So I tried . Nope ... did n't work for me either . I removed them from the case and put them back in ... Still did n't work . So I put the case on differently . Nope did n't work then either . I am returning these to Amazon . Label JUNK . Why spend $ 15/ea and they are not usable . I really wish that these case would work but they do n't they are going back . If a zero ratings was offered . These cases would qualify for a zero .	-1
I have all the mounts for the hero 3 There are no mounts as shown in the picture for the mic How does one mount any mic to the go pro case ? ? ?	-1
Seems to kill battery power no matter what settings I use . I 'm OK with the OS and the apps .	-1
First of all do not buy this from amazon , yet . These are normal vendors who bought the device at retail value and are reselling it at a profit for themselves . In about a month other retail chains shall be getting the device.Second , if you do end up buying the surface , do not buy the flat keyboard , get the tactile keyboard cover instead . It is impossible to type with the flat keyboard , you might as well be typing with your feet . Now I 'm going to give the pros first before I tear this thing a new oneProThe design of the surface tablet is fantastic , I'ts sharp edges give it a modern look . Being able to swipe the edges of the tablet also gives it some fun functionality . I can swipe the right black border to open up the options menu for example . That 's about it for prosConThis device does n't know if its a pc or a tablet . It ends up doing a poor job at both . You ca n't install any windows os software on the device , only windows rt software , so NO FIREFOX and NO CHROME . Your stuck using IE . And good luck finding any apps for the surface tablet . Did Windows not learn anything from Mac and Android.Besides being able to use a few entertainment apps , which you probably can use on other better devices which you probably own , you can use microsoft office on it . JOY ! ! My favorite are the bugs , I keep trying to click the back button on the store app and nothing happens for 20 minutes . This is supposed to be top of the line and you ca n't keep your store app from freezing the first time I use it ! ! ! ! You are basically buying an expensive digital typewriter . I paid $ 670 for the 32gig tablet and the tactile keyboard cover and I can not wait to send it back . I really wanted to like it but microsofts baby needed more time in the oven.I recommend buying an ipad or a samsung galaxy tablet . If you really need to do some work you can get a quality laptop for less than I paid for this nonsense . GET IT TOGETHER MICROSOFT .	-1
Microsoft does a great job of telling you everything this tablet is capable of . Unfortunately they do n't tell you anything that it can not do . For example : you can not hook up an external disc drive to it , therefore you can not play a dvd on it , and furthermore you can not burn anything to a disc for safe keeping . I sent it back because it was only good for 2 things . Surfing the net and paperweight .	-1
I mourn the demise of the Microsoft Empire . How could it have gotten to this point I ask myself .. ? If I were part of the development team for this , I would like to believe I would have begged them not to release it for at least a few more years . Even if it did n't crash , which is does , it 's nearly impossible to navigate , and painfully slow . This may not stop you from buying one , but at least I tried .	-1
Connectivity : - ( Does not support corporate standards like MobileIron so connecting to my company 's MS Exchange server is not possible . It 's a sad day for a PC fan-boy when better MS Exchange connectivity comes with an I-Pad ! I greatly miss Outlook and the RT Mail Ap that replaces it is universally seen at best as mediocre and uninspiring . And then , they removed all Ethernet support in Win 8.1 ! This is important where corps security concerns does n't allow wireless . Bottom line , NOT all USB hardware will plug into a RT . I bought this primarily to connect to a corp mail through Ethernet - for that , it 's a disappointing failure . The RT is only a fun toy for casual games.Software : -|Ca n't install anything ; only phone-like apps but very limited selection . And , the ones that exist often do n't really work . For example , Dropbox can only read and ca n't save any changes ( believe it or not ) . Usually , I just use the browser . This is the biggest issue for me . I typically use TeamViewer to remote into a real computer ( this is my RT 's only real value - being able to remotely control a real computer ) . But , most video sites will not work ( slightly better in 8.1 upgrade but too many other things have broken to get too excited ) , etc . Great for Netflix , simple games , and other distractions from work ( to be truthful , the most popular things on phones as well ) . Every RT app available is also available for Android but only one of the apps on my Android phone is available on RT ( a better mail program , Touchdown ) .UPDATE : The latest update includes OUTLOOK ! OMG , yes MS Outlook has come to RT . This is such a big deal that it alone is worth 1 star to me . And oh , there are more of my needed aps available.Hardware : - ( Audio and video ports no longer works , no cheap replacements for power adapter , things like speakers and touch screen occasionally go away ( unit never dropped ) . I will have to send back under the warranty ( and I 'm coming to realize that I wo n't miss it ) . Speakers are loud but lose all their power by being directional and pointed to the sides . GPS is off by 500 yards and so not good for driving . Everything else is similarly unimpressive.The size of the upgrades to the new Surface 2 shows the limitations of the original RT hardware . And yet , even the 2 's far better screen , cameras , two position kickstand , as well as multi-sensor , more accurate , and backlit keyboards ( with BlueTooth option ) , not to mention being faster and thinner , the new RT still has the fundamental software problems . To quote ZDnet 's James Kendrick `` The hardware of the Surface 2 looks good but it 's the [ unchanged ] software that kills the deal for me . The Windows RT software to be exact . '' The RT is neither a full PC nor a full phone . I still use the RT for watching Hulu ( which ca n't be seen free on a phone ) and movies ( I think a phone is a bit small for watching movies ) . But , I paid too much to get just that . I feel cheated . A full version of Microsoft Office ( Home and Student 2013 ) AND a full version of Windows 8.1 versus the cut-down s*** on Windows RT can be found with the much better hardware ( ZDNET agrees ) in theASUS Transformer Book T100TA-C1-GR 10.1-Inch Detachable 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop ( this tablet beats the Surface 2 on almost every metric being faster , longer battery , lighter , and cheaper at $ 380 ) .Documentation : - ( There is n't any ; you 're completely on your own . At least the XBOX ONE comes with tutorials , but not the RT.OS / Metro : -|Better interface than I-pad but must often go to classic Windows to do many tasks ( like MS Office ) . And , once there a mouse is often preferred . Metro feels like what Win 286 was originally aiming for before Bill saw the Mac 's overlapping tiles . I 've had a couple of touch screens in the past and always thought them useless until Metro - a touch based interface makes a big difference . : - ) Alas , freeze ups are a bore and Aps stutter ( such as with Bluetooth headphones ) . OS takes most of the boot drive so I must occasionally clean stuff off to keep it running . This is the best thing about RT but I 've found it was n't as important to me as I expected . In other words , if you do n't like Metro ( and I do ) , there 's no point to Windows RT at all.In SummaryI was very excited about this thing when I bought it ( I have a half dozen Win computers , three printers , not to mention a TV I spent more on than my car ) , but it has completely failed for most of the tasks I bought it for AND the hardware has not been reliable ( unfair when reliability was one of it 's selling points ) . My phones are about 20 % bigger and more expensive with each new contract . I had hoped to be able to keep an old phone and put the savings toward a tablet . This thing has a GREAT interface ( Metro ) but the bottom line for me is that it simply does n't work and does n't work consistently . My Android Samsung S4 has many more apps , the aps have more options , they work better , and work together better . I 'm coming to the conclusion that the best thing about my S4 is the OS . Perhaps , the problem was n't the idea of a tablet but only of Windows RT . I know that most commenters will laugh at my hoping this would work as a business device , so consider yourself warned yet again about such a foolish idea . The 1 star rating partly comes from knowing that just a little more effort could have delivered a real corporate winner ( yep , it 's partly a sour grapes rating ) .ZDNET editors have called the Surface RT one of the year 's bigget technology turkeys for being underpowered and overpriced , poorly timed , without sufficient apps that produced so little real value that even `` flashy dancers and scary schoolgirls '' could not sell them . Recent Microsoft ads define a `` real '' PC wholly as something that runs MS Office ( clones do n't count ) without mentioning a real mail program or corporate access . There is no way today to access a shared Exchange calendar on either any phone OS or RT ( and in other respects , phones do far more than RT ) . The large number of us finally figuring out MS dropped the ball here may be why the list price for the RT dropped 30 % to $ 349 ( so watch out for over list prices that occassionally show here ... ) and now you can get one for just $ 199 at Best Buy Black Friday . With no real market , Microsoft announced a $ 900 million `` inventory adjustment '' charge for its Surface RTs , parts and accessories . ZDNET says `` That 's pretty much the killer stat that says something went terribly wrong . '' If some people 's back-of-the-napkin calculations are right , Microsoft may be sitting on an inventory of 6 million unsold Surface RTs ! For those who might comment on how unfair this review is , that 's 6 million customers Microsoft was expecting who came to the same conclusion . BTW , here 's the vendor letter ( and I have a bunch of them ) that was the final end to any remaining enthusiasm ( and motivated me to upgrade my phone ) : Hi , Unfortunately , Microsoft has disabled the ability to get any current USB Ethernet Adapters working in Windows 8.1 : [ ... ] There is no known workaround at this time.We hope Microsoft will remove this limitation by the time Windows 8.1 ships , but do n't see any evidence in that direction so far.Sorry for the bad news ! support @ plugable.zendesk.com	-1
Since launch , the kindle app for this thing has been absolute garbage . So much so , that the last time I tried to use it , I slammed it down in frustration . The device bounced and flew at least 10 feet , hit a wall , and much to my surprise , did not have a single scratch on it . Anyway , as durable as it is , the two apps I use the most , kindle and IE , are basically alpha quality software . I 'm definitely suffering from buyer 's remorse .	-1
Loked identical to the Apple USB DVD+RW Super Drive ... but did not work . Apple Pro could never recognize the drive , it was not a plug and play drive . To Amazon 's credit I received a full refund .	-1
Did not do ANYTHING ! It did not work AT ALL , sending it back , very bummed because I did not have the opportunity to try it until a couple of months after I bought it . So far the vendor is being really cool about it . I just shipped it back and am hoping they can replace it with one that works . Sad .	-1
Touchpad and cursor would not work after two days trying to get them going . Plug a usb mouse in and had cursor . Returned for full credit .	-1
it just died after an hour or so . the next day it turned itself on and started blasting . then died again .	-1
At one time the radio would scan and remember all the stations it could detect , and it was possible to delete the ones I did n't want . It no longer has that capability . Nor will it jump from one detected station to another with the press of a button , as it did previously . The only way to get a different station is to punch the numbers in on the keypad . I would return it but the 30-day time window expired - about 30 days ago.Update : After the radio sat in a drawer for 3 months I tried it again , and it worked . Apparently there is a little processor in it that needed to reboot , although I could n't get it to do so previously . I now know that if you take out the battery and leave it alone for a while it will reboot . This does not make it good radio -- in my opinion radios should not have to be rebooted -- but it is not as bad as I previously thought . I 'm giving it one more star for a total of 2 .	-1
I own a SCH-1535 which is the Verizon US version of the SIII , and this cable did not work for HDMI video . It did work as a USB cable and the phone could charge from the USB power -- but those features are an afterthought . The primary purpose of the cable is for HDMI video to work , and it simply does n't . I tried it with both my HDTV and my computer monitor . I really doubt there 's a difference in HDMI pinout between the i9300 international version of the SIII and US versions like the SIII . Just do n't buy this , you 're better off with a Samsung-provided mini-dongle . It would have cost me more to ship it back to return it than it did to buy it .	-1
Design leaves a lot to be desired . You 're better off with a bag . I guess if it was just used for a travel kit . Not even good for that on second thought . Seemed like a good idea , just did n't work out .	-1
I have owned this since the end of July , 2013 . I rarely use it . Every time I use it , it 's slower than the time before . Now , google drive wo n't sync at ALL , even when connected to 12 Mbps wireless network , and trying to do anything in the browser is super slow . I tried to file a claim with squaretrade , but they said it 's still covered by manufacturer warranty . So , I have to try to find their number online ( it 's not included in the package ) . When I first got it , it was already acting slow . I liked that the battery charged very quickly , though . This item gets a 2-star rating from me , and it 's only because of the battery .	-1

So I bought this keyboard probably a month ago and I absolutely loved it ! I was able to type my novel and what not using the very cute and tiny detachable keyboard . I was amazed at how cheap this was and felt like I had absolutely scored a deal ! Then after a week or so , I realized I needed to charge it , so I plugged it into my computer using its charger that came alone with it . I find that the red button means that it 's charging , while the blue one means it 's on . Although I wish the lights would continue to stay on to indicate that it 's on when I accidentally leave it on ; I do n't mind it too much . So after I charged it , it worked for a little while longer , UNTIL one day while I was at work , I decide to use it so I turned it on and the buttons were off ! I typed the letters J , K , L only to get G , H , E , etc ... So I turned it off and tried reconnecting it . I tried pressing the numbers to indicate the sync and then it stopped working altogether . I can see the light turn on and off when I connect the keyboard to the charger and the iPad Mini sees and recognizes the keyboard . I just ca n't type with it . So overall I was unsatisfied with how long this keyboard lasted me . Perhaps it was just my luck of the draw ?	-1
the function buttons were going crazy so it had to be replaced/exchanged and the exchanged monitor was just as great without the problems with the buttons.have to return the second monitor I received.THe screen was not as nice As I thought . My son just told me that the screen is scratched . I 've never had a screen scratched before so I am sending it back for a refund and try a different monitor . I really thought Asus would be better ... .	-1
This is good travel tripod . I use it with a micro four thirds camera system that is about 3 lbs with lens . It is made of aluminum and it is very easy to carry and set up . The one flaw that caused me to lower its rating is the that the screw used to attach to the camera socket is a defective design of two pieces of metal press fit to form the screw threads and a cap that prevents the screw from pulling through the mounting plate . I discovered this fatal weakness when i picked up the tripod with the camera and lens attached , and the camera and lens broke off the mount and crashed to the ground . This is a horrifying tripod experience . The mount screw post broke off from the cap piece . I was able to replace the screw with a single piece stainless steel tripod mounting screw I purchased on Ebay for 3.00	-1
I had some difficulty with this company ... . I did not receive the item , and when I contacted the company they told me maybe it was because of the Hurricane that I did n't receive my product . I went to the post office and they looked the tracking number up and it stated that the product still had not left the company . I got in contact with them a couple of more times and finally I got them to send me another one.The product itself is o.k. , for now it will have to do . I have only used it a couple of times and the letters are already starting to rub off . The format of the keys are not as comfortable as I 'd like , and it is difficult to keep the bluetooth connected at times . I really do like the protection it provides for my Note but that would be the only plus in this purchase ... .	-1
the stand broke in a week time but the case is good . Also the standing position is bit more inclined than the normal reading position .	-1
They should sell this as a dust magnet . Unless you apply it in a clean room , it will be just a dust amplifier.On top of that , the opacity of the plastic is ridiculous . It eats up almost 50 % of the luminosity of the screen.Money wasted , 100 % .	-1
I located some Vizio SB4021E-A0 sound bars at a Sam 's warehouse . Since I understood that model lacked an optical port , I passed them by . However , as I was walking toward the Exit I observed another display at the end of an aisle , highlighting the Vizio model SB4021M-A1 . I bought it for $ 198.It must have been a challenge to pack the sound bar and sub-woofer together in a secure package . But Vizio did a good job with it . I was impressed . And I was surprised and pleased to discover an optical cord included with the unit . Finally ! I was concerned the LED stand on my LG set , which extends forward in front of the set on a table , would interfere with the sound bar positioning . I thought the unit would require I move the set backward to accommodate the sound bar in front . But this was not necessary . The legs on the sound bar raised it sufficiently to clear the stand . With the legs included the unit was only about 4 '' high . Installation was easy . So far so good.But I found the Bass effect to be overpowering at times . It soon became obvious that different TV programs required different sound bar and sub-woofer settings for optimum effect . While heavy Bass settings might be fine for playing games with explosions evident , they would not be acceptable for reality or news shows . I would increase the Treble settings and decrease the Bass settings to try to overcome those tendencies . Sometimes the sub-woofer would emit a low , continuous rumbling sound , like thunder . I found that to be quite annoying . Interestingly , that rumbling sound seemed to mellow over time.My major disappointment was with the Input settings accessed from the Menu button . The modes and numerical values are displayed in a window in front of the sound bar . But they are not evident on the TV screen . For example , I do n't know if the unit is in the Treble or Bass mode from the chair . So I am not able to adjust the settings if I do n't know what mode the unit is in . I asked Tech Support how I could project this data onto the screen . I was informed they could only be displayed in the window.But the windows readings are not evident from a chair 15 feet away . In fact , they are not evident until I arise from the chair and walk toward the set until I am 1'-2 ' from it . And I found that different programs required different Bass and Treble settings for optimum effect . Heck , if I have to leave my chair and approach within to within 1 ' or 2 ' of the TV set to read or adjust Input settings , why do I need a remote in the first place ? There is a Brightness control setting for the window . But , even with the setting set to a maximum setting of `` 10 '' , its effect was minimal.One reason I chose this unit over its competitors was the fact that it included an SRS TruSurround ( STHD ) feature . But this effect was non-existent with my unit.I 'm going to spend more time tweaking the thing . But I do believe it will go back . The clinchers are the requirement to approach the TV to change settings to the sound bar and sub-woofer and the lack of functioning SRS features . I do n't know if these symptoms are common on other sound bars or not . If they are it looks like I may have to cancel the sound bar project altogether . Perhaps the input provided by the optical cord is just not sufficient to provide the features I am looking for.I had hoped the new features of the Vizio unit would overcome the inconveniences presented by introducing an additional remote . But they did n't	-1
I have a Bose case that this one is supposed to be a copy of . There is no comparison in quality regarding the two . The Bose case is at least twice is thick and much more durable and hard . The zipper on my case was also broken and the seams around the zipper were not reinforced , so they sunk in.No all EVA cases are created equal I suppose . You get what you pay for.I am returning mine .	-1
I feel that this item is misrepresented . It is not a hard case . The case is very soft . I purchased it in order to protect my headphones while traveling . If I used this case , my headphones would get damaged . I have heavy cameras and other items in my carry-on luggage , and this is n't the case I need . I will be returning it . I hope that the company pays for the return postage .

This product DOES NOT WORK to convert HDMI to Component like for Apple TV or Similar . The signal does not transfer through the unit and will NOT play .	-1
Beggars ca n't be choosy and if I could have found another converter with 2 outputs at a reasonable price I would have sent this back . I have a 10 year old Sony plasma TV and ca n't justify a new TV for HDMI inputs while the picture still looks great . My biggest issue with this converter is the design ; due to cable inputs on both the front and back , it is impossible to position without cable clutter as well as making it more difficult to operate . As it is , the only place to put this is on the floor behind my TV stand making it a pain to switch inputs and cycle the power to reset the unit . The latter has to be done almost every other time the converter is used because either the sound quit working on my Blu-ray player or horizontal positioning is off on my computer . Cycling the power is also more cumbersome because without a power switch it is a two-handed operation . Another major issue is wavy lines across the picture at 1080p with my Samsung Blu-Ray player though it looks fine at 720p . Nor does it appear to play movies from my computer at 1080p with Windows Media Center though the TV shows it to be 1080i prior to starting a movie but it looks decent for most movies as well as playing Amazon Prime videos . Finally , though not the fault of the converter , the text quality is not good enough for Web browsing so do n't get it for that if you have and old TV as I do .	-1
The first time I plugged it all in it worked perfectly for its intended purpose . Specifically , stream from an OTG memory stick and stay charged at the same time.The second ( and third and forth , etc . ) times it would not charge ( streaming or not ) and each insertion of OTG memory required using the Nexus Media Importer troubleshooter to find both the cable and then the memory . Remove this cable and use a standard OTG cable and NO issues at all . I attempted plugging it all in using every imaginable & # 34 ; order & # 34 ; and nothing worked after the first use .	-1
When I received the item we were pleased with it at first . Within in 1 day of use it got stuck in a constant boot up loop . My husband who is very technically gifted researched the problem and their are entire forums regarding this issue with this brand . BAD IDEA ! When I tried to return it I had to go through Amazon directly rather than work with the seller . They tried to charge me shipping to return it after they tried to replace it with the same thing ! When I replied to them and told them no thank you , I even explained that the product has an issue that is discussed in several forums . They did not reply at all , only sent a shipping label for me to pay s/h costs on .	-1
I really do n't like having my time wasted . I read the reviews and thought this tablet would serve my needs . To turn on a tablet and see it work was great . Then I saw the battery was at 48 % . I found the charger cable and plugged it in . Nothing happened . I tried different USB ports and nothing . Now I 'm returning it for a refund . Yeah Amazon for great return policy . That 's why I try to stay with Prime purchases as much as possible .	-1
I do n't know what i was thinking when i bought this tablet sure its specks are equal to an ipad but laggy , battery sucks flash player is not even legit like a pirated version or something i have fixed many ipods iphones pcs one ipad and love ios i am never switching to android again	-1
***Update 10-2013 : Did n't last a year ! Crashed twice , lost all data and video-pics..recently for good maybe . Meanwhile our Samsung Galaxy Tab2 7inch that I paid $ 169 for is going strong ... perfectly ... good as new . I thought I should get on here and let people know before the holiday season is upon us ... if I could go back in time , I would have paid the extra $ 70 for another Samsung . At least my son would still have a tablet . Its stuck in some weird loop again and this time I ca n't seem to remedy it at all . ***UPDATE***7/5/2013 Just want to pass on that our tablet is still running great . It does n't have all the features or slick resolution of a Samsung , but for the price , it still amazes me of what it does for under $ 100.00 . ***update*** 12/13/2012 : my Tablet is now working fabulously . I will leave the details regarding my charging and temporarily dead tablet drama in case it helps others . In a word , this tablet is lightning fast , responsive , thin , lightweight and fun to use . The speaker is rather quiet - a little too quiet for movie rentals - I will be plugging in extra speakers ( or one person can use headphones ) when we use it to watch a movie . Its up and running out of the box in minutes , BUT be sure to start charging it right away and use the manufactur 's usb charger to acheive a full charge . Keep working at keeping it plugged in until you pass 99 % charged and hit the actual 100 % . The screen is grainy and the lettering for reading is considerably fuzzier than my Galaxy Tab2 which I paid under 200 for . I bought this as a 2nd tablet for my family . I would get a headache reading Kindle with it 's low resolution , but for apps , web browsing , e-mail , netflix , streaming Pandora etc . its a great bargain . Android Tablets DO drain quickly . Even when fully charged - it seems my kids can only have continuous use for 3-4 hours on my Galaxy Tab2.As far as buying a case- its precisely the same shape-size as the Galaxy Tab2 but the ports , speakers etc are in different places . Also- I 'm unclear if this is gorilla glass on this tablet - my other Galaxy 's surface feels like really sturdy , hard glass - no clue what the Pippo has or the scratching risk , but it does feel different-my fingernail tapping on it sounds like its plastic , just fyi . ***update*** late 12-11-2012 : For those who need help with Pipo tablet bugs : I 'may ' have discovered some issues and fixes -- my dead tablet is ON again and working ! ! ! I believe after much reading online , fiddling and consideration -that I simply received a faulty wall charger . It was just placed outside the box -- separate from the manufacturer 's packaging -- perhaps the seller was feeling generous and thre it in -- the charger does not say Pipo.If you are having troubles try the fixes I have listed . Keep in mind also , that I have discovered a extremely tiny `` reset '' button on the back of the Pipo tablet . I fiddled around with the following fixes- sometimes pressing the reset button for 10 seconds . I dug around and found an old 5 volt charger that I just happened to have with the correct plug -and low and behold , the bugging screen stopped and within 20 minutes began to stabilize . So then it occured to me to try the usb charger that was supplied and ONLY when I used the usb charger provided did the charging light stop the strange bugging and the screen finally , finally came back on . So those of you with strange battery issues -- consider the possibility that a simple switching out of chargers- might work . Wall chargers have always charged faster than usb in my opinion and it seemed to be charging well that first night-so i never tried the usb until tonight . I hope this helps someone and I hope to add an update tomorrow that this tablet indeed works as well on day three as on day one ! Also , you might consider using a good quality usb adapter to plug your provided usb cord into to convert it to a wall charger as I seemed to find a trail of owners who have had issues trying to use the wall instead of a computer which really limits the portability-the whole point ! I have experimented with THAT tonight too and my Pipo says `` charging '' apparently succesfully.Earlier today , 12-11-2012I spent some time online searching around through android tablet forums . I tried this and it `` seems '' like my tablet is at least charging again ( but still has a buggy flashing screen ) - I am going to let it `` charge '' overnight ( If that is what its in fact doing right now ) and post my observations- if it miraculously performs normallly after this `` trick '' reset , I will be sure and give an honest review : Plugged the Pipo into my laptop using a regular usb cord ( mine came with a wall charger-interesting that others ' did not ) then held BOTH the volume and power buttons down , then after 40 seconds let go only of the volume buttons , continued to hold down the power button for another 40 seconds . It seemed there was no response , BUT when I then immediately plugged it into the wall with the wall charger and held down the power button it went into charging mode with no buggy , flashing images . Then the flashing stuff started again . I do n't want to mess with it until tomorrow , when I know its fully charged.I tried this process the day it worked great and then died however , ( and this is important ) the android forum posters explained that one must often just *wait , * it seems , until the battery completely looses all charge before this reset trick will work . Perhaps that is what happened to my tablet between last night and tonight , I do n't know.I 'm really happy for those who have had no troubles with their Pipo tablet- I have to admit I was excited to see how well it was competing those first few minutes with my Galaxy Tab2 ( bought in the fall at Costco $ 189 . ) ( except for screen resolution-the Galaxy is incomparably more crisp and clear-the Pipo is noticably fuzzier ) . The Samsung Galaxy S2 only gets a few hours of gaming or movie time before it needs to be recharged if that helps anyone out there.Original review 12-10-2011 : I waited and waited for this to arrive . I was about to give it a glowing review ( except for the grainy resolution ) because it DOES stream Netflix , play angry birds and its FAAAAST , til it DIES . I got to use this for a hot ten minutes , was called away for an hour and upon return : no dice . Wo n't turn on . ( And yes , I did charge it for several hours in advance ) . Screen and charger light gets all buggy with the wall charger plugged in . I 've tried the trick I use on my Galaxy Tab : hold your finger down on the screen while turning it on and : NOTHING . Once I had the key phrase `` wont turn on '' to couple with `` Pipo '' in a search engine , the trail of problems with this device became apparent . Numerous others have had the same catastrophe and describe the same odd behavior after using 1 to a few times . I am contacting the seller for a refund . Darn . If I have a positive experience with the seller I will update this .	-1

Belkin has made a decent case and a great Bluetooth keyboard but did not follow through on putting them together . First , the case : great fit with the KF HD , well made , OK synthetic cover material , nice and soft interior , cutouts in all the right places . The case stays closed with a magnetic tab . When the case is open , the tab folds back and stays out of the way . The keyboard was a snap to connect via Bluetooth , and I love typing on it . It 's light but not flimsy , perfect for the KF HD or any other Bluetooth enabled device . The rechargeable battery means there 's no need to worry about remembering to bring extra batteries - a big plus in my book . A USB charging cable is included.However ... the keyboard attaches to the cover with Velcro . When I leave the keyboard in the cover , the angle of the Kindle propped up is too small , making the KF unstable . It 's unstable enough to fall face down on top of the keyboard . I did not notice any scratches but I would not risk it again . When I remove the keyboard , the KF HD can be propped up at several different angles and is much more stable . But then I have to hold the keyboard - with the scratchy part of the Velcro on it - on my lap or need a table to use it comfortably.When the cover is closed with the keyboard in place , the whole thing is understandably bulkier compared to the KF in a case without a keyboard . I mentioned the soft interior of the case - too bad the screen of the Kindle does not touch any of that softness because it is facing the keyboard . Sure , the keyboard has two rubber thingies on the top - presumably to keep the Kindle screen from touching the keyboard - but I do n't feel the screen is protected enough should I toss the Kindle in a bag or should it come across any kind of pressure . I 'd be happy to keep the keyboard out of the case if there was a separate carrying case for it.Last but not least - the price . For $ 100 , I would expect a genuine leather case with all of the above issues resolved . I bought it at a lightning deal for just under $ 60 , and that would have been a fair price if not for the way the keyboard and case are put together . As it is , if you want a Bluetooth keyboard for your Kindle Fire HD , I suggest going with a good case for the Kindle and a separate keyboard . Belkin does offer a similar standalone keyboard . Unfortunately , it again comes without a carrying case.In short , this case / keyboard combo could easily earn 5 stars if the Velcro is eliminated , the price is about 40 % lower , and the keyboard gets a cover to protect it and the KF HD screen .	-1
The keys do not move at all and so this is very hard to type on . I 'd recommend the style with the moving keys even though it is a little thicker .	-1
I have an iPhone and got a case for that ( ca n't think of the name ) but it 's completely enclosed ; you could probably run over it in a car , and nothing would happen ! I for some reason assumed this case would be similar ... . it 's not ! It 's just a metal backing , which wraps up onto the L and R sides but not the top or bottom . The front is wide open ... ALSO , you have to slide it up or down out of the case to use the volume control thingy on the side . Finally figured that out ! Well , it does have a belt clip but I do n't wear belts so I do n't use it . I 'm really not sure what it 's supposed to be protecting but I do like the iPod and I guess it is n't hurting anything for it to be in this slight little case ( except , as I said , I have to slide it halfway out just to adjust volume ) .	-1
Bought the clear frostshell case for my 7th gen ipod nano.Some of the reviews pointed out that it slides out from the top while some said it was a secure and did n't move.I decided to purchase and I am disappointed.Pros-It is a nice case that fits snugly . It would protect the sides but the screen and top/bottom of the case is open.-There were some complaints about the side being difficult to use , but it was n't an issue for me.-Good priceCons-My Ipod nano keeps on sliding out from the top . Not as easily as the other reviewer that said the ipod slides out when held upside down . When I plug in the lightning cord or my headphones , the ipod would slide up . I started testing the case and found that when i hold the case by the sides and make a sudden movement , the ipod would slide up on the case . When I did it really hard , the ipod slid right out of the case which is a no no for me if I want to use this on the go/run . I 've only used for two days and the Ipod already starting sliding out when I had it in my pocket . The earphones plug would push the ipod up.Overall , if you are n't going to be on the move , this is a nice case.It would be a perfect case for me if my nano stayed in place.I am scared it may accidentally slide out and also it is annoying because I have to keep pushing the ipod back into place .	-1
Update : Roocase now makes a true spring clip case : rooCASE Hybrid Silicone Detachable Holsterand it comes in colors ! Why put a clip on if it wo n't hold onto anything ? Not only that but it takes two hands just to pry the clip up . The only thing this case is good for is mild protection and making the wafer thin new nano easier to hold on to.People seemed confused by my original brief review ... So to try to clarify , the clip is not spring-tensioned in any way except by the resistance provided by the plastic material where it bends out from the cutout in back . As such , it is really more of a hook than a clip , and will only work right side up on something thin , like the edge of a pocket . If that 's all you want from a clip , that might be fine . But I was used to the old nano which had a fantastic spring clip that I could clip to my shirt in bed as I wore it to sleep . Resigned to just using it as a hook on a pocket when walking now , it is still a frustrating design because the bottom of the clip is indented into the cutout that it was formed from , with very little edge sticking up to lift it with , and when you touch it it just bends down into the cutout because there 's so little tension . So you have to hold the sides of the clip and pry it up to hook it onto anything , which is why it takes two hands . IMHO the design just needs more work , and they prioritized looks over functionality.To summarize : Cons : hook , not clip . Hard to open clip , yet does n't hold securely.Pros : looks nice , pretty colors , fits well.Alternatives : I bought a minisuit clip case , which does n't look as pretty but has an actual functioning spring tensioned clip.B00A0QSLJGUnfortunately it broke after 8 months of use.Update 10/2013 : Now Roocase makes a spring clip case , going to try this one : rooCASE Hybrid Silicone Detachable Holster	-1
I had high hopes for this case but ultimately I ended up buying another , better case from a local store . This case would not hold my ipod as described . My ipod was constantly slipping out of the case , crashing to the ground . Needless to say , I was pissed ! I was able to get it to stay for a bit by adding some thick paper behind my ipod when inserting it in the case but COME ON ! I should n't have to do that.This was such a regrettable buy !	-1
I bought the iPad Air black rear cover and had to return it . It was poorly packaged and arrived bent out of shape , but the real problem were the smudges on the back of the unit - despite being in a sealed package . It looks like a used item . Also the rear is glossy making it very prone to fingerprints . I wonder if I got a knockoff rather than the real deal , since many people seem to have received high quality items with this same name and description .	-1

In a proper case , all the ports on the tablet are meant to be accessible when the case is closed . This case does not make the pogo port accessible when the case is closed . The port is however accessible when the case is open , but this is apparently only by accident . I had to manually cut out a portion of the case around the pogo port using a knife and scissors to make it properly accessible . In contrast , competing products have the port properly accessible .	-1

all of the screen covers are extremely difficult to place on bubble free . this one seemed good online and with three skins , i thought we had a chance . even with the system they have it was once again impossible to get it on the ipod touch without 12 bubbles ( or so ) . the only luck i 've had with screens is when i had one put on in the sprint phone store . ugh .	-1
And we still did n't get it to work . I do n't know why or what I was doing wrong , but it appears to be FAR from & # 34 ; Plug & Play & # 34 ; . If it was truly & # 34 ; Plug & Play & # 34 ; they would n't have an additional logging/debugging program to figure out why it does n't work , but they do . I cant say what the problem was , but I have a feeling it was n't on my end . To be fair I gave up after a while , but i had spent considerable time emailing them back & forth and putzing with their program trying to get it to work with my laptop . NO LUCK . I still do n't have Bluetooth capability on my laptop ( to play music through a portable speaker ) and I still have it because I did n't make the time to return it . The only reason they got 2 stars is because I feel they put better than average effort into it .	-1

I should have listened to other reviews about this item , but i did n't . The wet application & applicator are easy enough to use , but it takes you about 15 minutes to get the water out of the skin , and then if you have small particles of dust under , you have to restart the application again.On top of that , the skin itself is not that `` clear '' and it does lower the quality/viewing perception of the display a bit . Consider also the fact that it is very soft , and you can see all the marks of the skin when you move it on the light.Also when i contact skinomi for an exchange i got an automated email telling me the steps to exchange or return , which in that case i would have to pay for shipping.Will update review to see how return/exchange went	-1
I had happily used a ThinkPad of some variety for over 8 years , however my last two ThinkPads were not up to snuff ( W520 & Tablet ) . Lenovo has destroyed the brand I loved/trusted , but I held some hopes that I could at least keep using a bluetooth ThinkPad keyboard paired with another machine and retain some of the ergonomics of the ThinkPad experience . Boy was I wrong.First , this is a wrist-killer . It is not angled at all and completely lacks the ergonomics of the traditional ThinkPad keyboard . The key travel is not quite deep enough to work either , but that is a secondary gripe to the pain that I almost instantly felt using it.I ca n't speak entirely for the optical pointer , as Lenovo only makes drivers available for 32bit Windows 8/8.1 . These do not work in 64bit Windows , so I was stuck using the horrible little optical pointer like a touchpad with the default Microsoft drivers - which is a horrible experience and very un-ergonomic . The whole point ( unavoidable pun ) of the traditional ThinkPad pointing stick is that it allows you to keep your wrists down and your fingers in a ready-to-type position . This optical monstrosity forces you to make much larger motions with your finger and I found myself lifting my wrists , which completely destroys the effectiveness of the keyboard pointer concept.I got an amazing price on this ( essentially half off ) and still ca n't justify keeping it even as a backup keyboard . It is going back . The standard ThinkPad bluetooth keyboard is too large for my use ( ultra-portable ) , so this will end my foray into keeping a ThinkPad keyboard in my work environment.I have been very happy with Logitech 's wireless keyboards , and even found the Microsoft Wedge ( I picked it up as a backup to this ) to be vastly more comfortable . If you need a comfortable , small keyboard , look anywhere else ! Rant/Conclusion : This is what happens when a brand created around function and ergonomics declines into nothing more than a name with zero engineering talent behind it . Thanks for ruining ThinkPad Lenovo !	-1
I wanted this to work . The company and packaging seemed top notch . The installation was too wet and the shield wrinkled , left smudges , and was generally poor quality . I returned it for a refund .	-1
I purchased this item after using Zagg InvisibleSHEILDs for a few years . I was tired of the rubbery feel of the InvisibleSHEILD , as many people have said ( it did n't feel as nice to use as the bare screen and liked to stick to other smooth surfaces ) . When I got my Nexus 10 , these were my criteria for finding a new brand : 1 ) it had to feel like the bare screen , or at least close ( no frictiony rubber feel ) , and 2 ) it had to be a wet application ( I 've used both , and dry application is simpler , but _never_ looks as nice in the end ) . So how did this live up to those standards ? Upon receiving it , it 's obvious that they 're trying to mimic the InvisibleSHEILD concept . It says all over the packaging that it 's military grade , like the InvisibleSHEILD does , and it has some of the same demonstrations on their website . What does that mean ? Well , it 's still a little rubbery . Not nearly as bad as the InvisibleSHEILD , but definitely not like the glass screen , either . If that were the only problem , though , it would still get 4 stars.Unfortunately , as other reviewers have said , the application squeegee left scuff marks across the screen ( two big , obvious ones and many small harder to see ones ) . Now , before anyone criticizes me for not using enough solution , I sprayed the screen pretty well before squeegeeing it ( 3-5 squirts ) . If that was n't good enough , then it 's simply too hard to do right . Not to mention , if a rubber squeegee is capable of scuffing it , how will it hold up to anything else ? ( To be completely fair , I have n't noticed any new scratches in the two weeks I 've had it , but I keep my tablet in a sleeve ) .Edit : I was originally concerned that the soapy nature of the wet solution would leave behind residue and affect the operation of the device , but it 's been several months with no problem , so it does n't concern me anymore.Overall , if it were n't for the squeegee scuffs , I would n't mind the other issues , which were pretty minor . Those scuffs are enough for me to say I am not likely to buy one of these again , though .	-1
iPads have have magnetic wake/sleep and rear facing camera features for several years now . This cover does not support wake/sleep and there is no rear facing camera . The latch is stiff enough to constantly get in the way as well as swing into the screen and scratch the glass surface .	-1
When they are not being used , but on , they sometimes make little crackles and noises . Absolutely annoying.Quality is pure plastic , and sound is very small and basic.Headphone Jack does n't even work , so I do n't get the idea why they even made one.POS . For sure .	-1
Pros : cheap ( as in inexpensive ) Cons : cheap ( as in every other meaning of the word ) Sound quality is awful to the point of unusable . Do n't know what I was expecting for less than $ 20 . They do make noise , are powered from a USB port , and are otherwise as advertised , so I passed them along to a starving grad student who decided that going hungry with better speakers was better than eating ramen while listening to these and promptly recycled them.I feel guilty about the entire experience , but I 'm working with my therapist on moving on .	-1
The case fit well however there is a serious flaw in the design ( for this phone ) . The opening around the charging port only uses a thin piece of rubber material to connect on the screen side . If the phone fell and hit this area ... it is so thin and flimsy that there is virtually no protection . I sent it back and bought a Trident ... I love it .	-1
I really , really dislike this . Compared to the Fotasy FF2B , there is nothing this follow focus does right.-single rail , slide-on mount is a pain to put on and take off , should you need to adjust or switch sides-adjusting height means turning 2 different levers-focus ring has no grip to it.-focus ring *literally* makes a ringing noise when you tap it . Try explaining that to your sound guy.-no focus stops at all-very hard to turn-significant amount of lash-the whole unit , while solid , is slippery and unwieldy . I 've dropped it for this very reason.For virtually the same price , there is no reason whatsoever to get this over the Fotasy FF2B . I bought bought and am SO much happier with that one . I mount this one on the opposite side as a zoom pull , but if I had to buy it again , I 'd buy TWO of the other one .	-1
I dropped the phone with the cover unstrapped and the bottom got scratched , then the phone popped out . The bottom was scratched because the case does not fully protect the bottom as the area near the glass is uncovered . However , if the case was strapped , the phone would have been fully protected.Second , when you fold back the cover to use the phone , the thin , half length binder does not support the weight of the phone . As a result , the phone and case will flop around . You need a firm grip of the phone , not the cover . With other portfolio cases I 've used , this is not a problem because the binder is the full length of the case.Personally , I would not recommend it unless there is nothing else in a higher price-point you like . This was my situation .	-1
Based on the reviews and specs , I had recently & # 34 ; upgraded & # 34 ; to what I thought would be a decent camera , the nd-bc6 . Originally I had a Kenwood rear cam and after looking at this one ( after it was professionally installed ) , I wish I had kept my old camera . Money down the drain . Not only was the picture washed out and oversaturated , it was extremely grainy and this is in the daytime . I am going to have it removed as soon as I can replace it . Absolutely awful . I would HIGHLY advise AGAINST purchasing this product .	-1
It will not work on my Mac . I tried the newest driver from 2 different websites to no avail . I will give it another try the next time I update my mac , which will be in a few months .	-1
Could n't get the drivers to work properly on a Windows XP or Windows 7 machine . Tried for a bit then gave up and sent it back .	-1
Build Quality : Good , but not great . The backup battery was definitely the worst in terms of quality.Size : The case was actually a good size . I like a bulkier phone , so this caused no problems . I have a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50 headphones , but I was unable to use them with the case on , because the hole for the headphone jack was too small , so keep that in mind . The battery was not too big , but not small either . I could have it in my pocket without noticing it.I was so excited when I first ordered this . I mean , com on , no more wires ? Sounds great ! Well worth the $ 100.Well , I soon found out it was not worth it.When it got delivered , without wasting any time , I tore it open , slapped the case on , and plugged in the charging mat.After I got the case on my phone , I noticed that it had 2 long cracks going down the back of the case , on each side . Now they were n't huge cracks , but I could tell that the case was n't going to last long . Without hesitating , I sent it back for a replacement.The second one that I got , the case was in great condition , no cracks . I thought it was great , I got used to not having cords , and having a backup battery that also did not need to be plugged in was great . Soon after though , I noticed that when my phone was charging on it , there was a very high pitched buzzing sound . But that only happened when I was charging my phone . The backup battery never made that sound . Granted I did keep the charging station right next to my bed.After my bad experience with it , I decided that this product had more downsides than upsides , so I returned the second one.Really it all comes down to if you get lucky on build quality or not . If you can live with a buzzing sound , and you get a case that is not broken , then I guess this would be a good product , I just am not a fan .	-1
I bought this to help prep for nanny duty coming soon . I like the fact that it is a solid metal shell , sturdy and compact . The control which is a push button dial is basic but serves it 's function well enough . The menu and software is basic which is fine considering the price , nothing fancy just basic file selection then push the dial in for play and it will reply what it recorded . If it was on montion sensor then it would only play from the time it picked up motion to the time seconds after it senses no more changes in the background . The deal breaker for me was the motion detect . It has settings for continuous , stills and motion . The continuous is fine so if you do not plan on using the stills or motion detect your fine . I however wanted to maximize my microsd and not try to review 24 hrs of pure nothing so I wanted motion detect . It barely worked ! ! I tried different spy cams , same result . It will only sense massive changes in background so in other words , I can jump up and down and have my wife and I walk thru the view range and it will not record . However if I took the cam and gave it shaken baby syndrome or blocked the most of cam with my hand for about a few seconds , then it MAY record . By that time , the nanny/burglar/whoever would beat everyone senseless , eat a sandwich and then leave the house ! I probably only get a pic of the show out the door by then WTH ! . I really was hoping this would work out but it looks like I will have to buy a full size DVR unit 4 channel and run some lines.Oh , did I mention it came with Euro power supply plug ? They included an adapter but by the time you plug it all in , The stack is about 5 inches high or so , not including the power strip . Yea ... It does support up to 32 gb microSD and the motion detect was the unit . I have good cameras ( 600 TVL ) and while the pic is fine , it 's the motion detect that kills this . Still images are fine , but if someone sneaks in and out of frame in less than a few seconds ... it would miss them . I tried..it did not catch me walking from the doorway into the master bath and back out.1/21/14 - I guess a couple promoters of this product disagrees with me	-1
I was hoping for a compact solution to playing music from my iPhone or iPod while decluttering my rooms after my move ... this definitely is a compact solution . Unfortunately , not a very good one.As other reviewers have noted , the tangle of cords makes this of really limited use.I have a small bluetooth speaker ( EasyAcc Bluetooth Speakers Portable Wireless Mini for iPhone / iPod / iPad 3 2 / Smartphones : Samsung Galaxy S4 , S3 , S2 , Ace , Note 2 ; HTC One , One X , Desire X ; LG Optimus 4X HD , I7 , I9 ; Nokia Lumia 920 , Google Nexus 4 , Blackberry Z10 , Sony Xperia Z ; Table ... ) which sounds SOOO much better and you have the freedom to move it around and not get everything tangled up in cords .

I bought this cover because of hte raving reviews for it.The cover is great for the first two three days of use . Then the Velcro somehow starts to get loose and the surface starts to droop . It does n't hold the surface into place nicely at all with two tiny Velcro straps . It would make sense to have a flap to hold it up . Anyways ... this product was not good .	-1
Update : After about two weeks of use , I started getting dropped connections . Every 24-48 hours , the network just stops responding , but pulling the power cord on the router , then re-plugging fixes it . I 've checked the firmware , but have n't been able to solve the problem.I also suspected that the router might be overheating . Its heat vents are on the bottom of the unit , it has no cooling fan , and the feet are less than a centimeter high , so there is n't much space to vent heat . Some other routers have a similar problem , so it 's not unexpected , but addressing that did n't solve my problem , so I 'm not sure what the problem is.Checking the net , people with overheating routers have tried ( 1 ) flipping the unit upside down so the vents are point up ; ( 2 ) adding a USB fan to cool the router ; ( 3 ) drilling extra vent holes ( with the case OFF the router , of course ) ; ( 4 ) adding heat sinks to the router chips , or substituting the existing heat sinks for larger ones ; or ( 5 ) elevating the router to get the vents off of the surface so heat can diffuse more easily.I put together a stand by bending a coat hanger , and managed to raise the router about six inches above the the shelf it sat on . Still , this was crashing every day or two , so I ended up going back to my original router.My original review is below : ============================================================Great If You Need 802.11ac , Fine But Pricey If NotSummary : If you are ready to be an early adopter of the 802.11ac `` gigabit wireless '' standard , this router is very good . If not , it 's fine , but a bit pricey.802.11ac Support : 802.11ac is the new hotness , a way of using the 5gz band to achieve Ethernet-quality speeds over wireless . This is mostly going to be valuable for people who are streaming multiple HD signals wirelessly , or who envision frequent large wireless file transmission in their LAN and are willing to pay for speed.The catch is that to build an ac network , you are going to need devices that can receive ac . The simplest and most compatible way to do that now is to buy the matching WD bridges -WD My Net AC Bridge , 4-Port Gigabit WiFi Media Speeds , Easy Setup AC Wireless Bridge . Then you can plug your TV , computer , DVR , etc . into that bridge and achieve ( again theoretically ) gigabit level wireless speed . Alternately , if you have client devices with 802.11ac built in , that will work too.I apologize - I do n't currently have an ac home network , so I ca n't comment further on the ac performance . The reviews for the WD bridge are positive , so if you are willing to spend the money on both sides and need high speed , this might do it for you . ( Of course , you ca n't get any faster than whatever internet you are plugging into the router , so watch out for bottlenecks on that side , too ) .Other Features : - Setup is easy on this ( for a router ) and relatively powerful . You can set up parental controls so that some devices are locked out after bedtime , or are barred from identified sites . The firmware includes the ability to share plugged in drives and to engage in QoS ( quality of service ) adjustment to give extra bandwidth to high-priority uses.- The server provides up to 4 networks : a 5.0 password restricted network , a 2.4 password restricted network and a `` guest network '' on each bandwidth . I appreciate having the guest network , which lets my guests reach the internet without telling them my password , messing with authentication , or sharing my home devices.- The 2.4 network is fine . Like some of the other reviewers , I had a lot of dropped connections at first . However , setting the 2.4 network to a static channel instead of letting it find its channel dynamically seemed to solve this problem.- Range is fine in my house for both networks . I have the router on top of a bookcase in the ground floor of my house , and both networks reach all points of my house and the yard with plenty of signal .	-1
This is the worst set of ear buds I 've gotten from JLAb . I bought them for the look but after one day of trying to cope with the quality and size I had to switch . I 'm giving the review two stars because they are ok for audiobooks/talk , but useless for anything else : music , movies , etc.Also the bud is too big . If you wear a small or medium size rubber in-ear piece , this bud will probably be uncomfortable . It forces the tragus out and feels awful to wear all day , like something is jammed in your ear .	-1
It has tangle-free flat cords , which are nice . the problem is it sounds bad . tinny and not full , like listening to music with paper plates taped to your head .	-1
I received these earbuds less than 5 minutes ago . When I opened the package I was super excited because the earbuds look REALLY cool and I love the flat cord & # 34 ; no tangle & # 34 ; design . BUT when I started listening to music the sound started cutting out ... I thought that maybe it was my phone messing up but I figured out that it was the cord , when the cord is barely bent or moved near the input ( where the rubber meets the cord ) the sound cuts out in either the left or right ear and sometimes even both ... Since I am a human being and I plan on moving while listening to music , these earbuds are not for me . I got my wife some JBuds J2 's and they are awesome so I figured these would be even better , but I was wrong unfortunately . Going to buy myself a pair of JBud J2 's now ! I hate returning items right after getting them ... and waiting for them to come in the mail !	-1
These headphones have great sound quality and everything , but if you are doing any movement they will not stay in your ear . I 've tried all the different sizes for the ear pieces , but what I 've found is the wire is too heavy and will pull out the headphones from your ear . It 's super frustrating .	-1
I have three criticism of this case : First , this so called `` clear '' case is NOT clear at all . It is actually FROSTED ! When it says clear , it should be clear like glass , but instead it 's cloudy and hazy looking . Translucent or frosted would be the more apt description.Second , the bottom of the case is incredibly ugly with all sorts of circular and rectangular holes and two bulky kick stands . I suppose the holes may be useful for heat dissipation ( although the Macbook Pro does n't have any vents on the bottom ) , but they make the bottom of your computer look hideous . Also the kickstands look like they 'll snap off easily leaving two gaping holes if they do . I understand that not many people look at the bottom of a computer so who cares right ? But I purchased a Mac . I clearly place aesthetics and details highly on my list-even if it 's the bottom of a computer.Third , while 10-11 ounces may not seem like a lot , this is actually 0.65 pounds ! Add this to the newly reduced weight of the MacBook Pro 13 Retina ( Late 2013 edition ) and the computer suddenly jumps back to its former heavy weight of 4.1 pounds.Overall , I am rather disappointed in this case for all of the reasons above .	-1
I gave this product a 2 star because it was not what they sent me , and they sent me another brand for the second time within a month that did not work . customer service responded to the problem to fix it , but after two bad ones , did not trust so opted for a refund . the customer pays for shipping both ways regardless of circumstances , you lose again . would not recommend my friends this product , they are having software problems where you can not download apps nor do passwords .	-1
Updated review . I do n't ever use this system . There is no way to change the setting for when you are away that there is a delay time for the alarm to go off once a door is opened ... So if you do n't have the bulky key fob you will be setting off your alarm everyday . Also the alarm cord is exposed where someone could just unplug it and the length of the cord is only about 3-4 ft .	-1
4 cords , 4 weeks . Yup , four weeks and every single cord is no longer functional . Poorly made , the cord ripped out or weakened at the pin connector joint on every single one of them . They were never yanked on or ripped out of the wall either . Just a cheaply made cord . Do n't waste your money unless you want to be a repeat customer buying on a weekly basis .	-1
While I LOVE the colors and length- keeps people from stealing them- the connections are soldered on crappy and they broke at the joint . Do n't waste your money . Spend the extra cash and get a decently made one .	-1
Picture shows function keys option . Wrong picture . It does function as well as a touch keyboard would be expected to .	-1
Cheapest case I have ever owned .	-1
Once I assembled the Cimo case correctly , it fit my iPod like a glove . However , the & # 34 ; fatal flaw & # 34 ; was apparently the snugness of the case . Once installed , my iPod would not charge . I had to call Apple tech support , set up a Genius Bar appointment at an Apple store , and write to the manufacturer describing this issue . I received a prompt reply telling me that some of the units in their last batch apparently had a similar manufacturing defect . They immediately refunded my entire purchase . I continue to use the unit , but I have to remove it from the case in order to charge it . You may have better results than I experienced . I have mixed feelings about this product . Apple products are designed to perfection . Third party products for Apple hardware cost less than official Apple gear , and most of the time work just as well . Even the Apple technician thought that the Cimo case was well designed . However , I did n't expect that such a simple product would involve so much follow up time .	-1
If it actually fit ! It 's very loose and falls off very easily . The loosest diffuser I 've ever owned . Do n't waste your money on this one .	-1
Original comment below ... I had to update this review and change it from 5 stars to 1 star . I bought this for a wedding to overdub the sound onto the video , the clip on mic that came with it was perfect for clipping on the groom to catch all the vows ... I used it quite a few time on the days leading up to the wedding and it worked great . The I went to the rehearsal for the wedding the day before , it recorded as it should and picked everything up that I needed ... Then on the day of the wedding , about 5 minutes before the ceremony started I clipped it on the groom and started the recorder . It showed the timer counting so I knew it was recording , i set it in his pocket and he walked off ... After the ceremony , I got it back from him and it was off ( only about 30 minutes after starting it ) . I thought `` ohh no , I hope it recorded the vows '' ... then i plugged my headphone in to review , and after 3 seconds it comes up with a message `` FORMAT ERROR '' ... I took it home , plugged it into my computer and sure as shit , nothing is there ... I am sooo disapointed I bought this and didnt spend a little more money on something of quality ... If you are not doing anything important , or something doing something that can be re-done if needed , then this would work for you , but if you have one shot to capture what you need DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK ! *ORIGINAL*Included mic works , but is n't very great sound quality . Recorder works perfect though and lasts a long time on the battery .	-1
This audio recorder is hard to figure out the menu . The device does not support equalizer function while recording . The recording quality is not to my expectation	-1
I am using this cable on a Samsung Note II . It connects to every TV I 've tried it on with no problems . The resolution is great . Picture quality is great , even the sound is decent , but it will not charge my phone . I have tried using the original Samsung USB charger as well as an aftermarket charger and neither one will charge . The indicator on the phone ( little lightning bolt ) shows that the battery is being charged , but it is not . If I disconnect my phone from my factory charger with a 100 % charge , then connect to this HDMI cable and watch two episodes of Breaking Bad , the phone will be at the 15 % or less yellow indicator . It was $ 5 though . Oh well ...	-1
While I like the technology , for me it simply did not do enough to justify the $ 300 price tag , considering that you can buy a new 50 '' flat panel TV today for $ 500 . Maybe it was the fact that my 42 '' plasma was too small or did n't need a lot of help . Ca n't tell . But the deal breaker was that despite its hefty price tag its critical proprietary internal algorithm is not user software/firmware upgradeable , meaning that the Darbee would have to be removed from my system and shipped back to the manufacturer for any upgrade . That was not the type of inconvenience I expected to find for a $ 300 computerized device in 2014 . Also , since you can buy a good HDMI switch for $ 15 they could have included multiple HDMI inputs for the price ( which is now $ 319 on Amazon ) . Again , promising technology , just not worth the price at this point .	-1
I purchased this projector because of all the great reviews it received ( from many different websites ) . When I received it , I immediately noticed that its throw distance was really short ( for those who do n't know , the shorter the throw , the larger the image ) . For some , having a short throw would be desirable , however my theater room is 20 ' x 20 ' . My projector ceiling mount is approx . 18 feet from the screen . Even at the lowest zoom setting , the BenQ W1070 's short throw produced an image ( 1920x 1080 resolution of course ) that was too large for my 124 & # 34 ; screen . After performing some calculations , I would have had to move the project to with 15 feet of the screen in order for the image to fit properly . Also -- the image quality/clarity was not as good as Optoma projectors ( I also own an Optoma HD25 ) .This projector had a great price , but it is not the one for those whom have large theater rooms . Go for the Optoma HD25 instead .	-1
The gestures that can be used by Windows 8 are excellent . You can find a list of the gestures in another persons ' review here on amazon ( kudos , it 's a good list ) .The thing I absolutely hate about it is that the texture/material they used for where your finger goes feels like the rubber on the bottom of the 4 footies that keep it in place ; it 's not `` hard '' to move your fingers across it persay , but when you compare it to ANY laptop texture ( let alone the macbook magic trackpad glass texture ) this one pales in comparison.If you 're looking to get a great experience out of Windows 8 touchpad glory , stay AWAY from this model : The surface has too much grip to comfortably get from place to place on your screen efficiently .	-1
I picked mine up and Fry 's . There were 5 on the shelf and all had been returned and marked down 5 % . Bad sign . I tried anyway since it was cheaper than the Logitech T650.Upon arriving home I found no information online about it and no software to install to customize anything . Every search I tried led mostly to `` deal '' pages trying to sell this for cheaper than I paid . The only two reviews were here on Amazon.I have been trying to get used to it for a few days . Admittedly , I 'm trying to get used to the Windows 8 gestures after using Mac gestures at work ( hence the desire to customize ) . This may be part of my problem , but the other issue is that the pad does n't seem to be very sensitive . It requires very deliberate gestures and sometimes the pad seems too small for them . I even changed my Mac gestures to be closer to the ones on Windows 8 , but I 'm still having trouble .	-1
The keyboard layout was not what I hoped for . It took two hours of use before the keys started popping off the keyboard . Returned for refund the next day .	-1
I bought this keyboard case as a birthday present for someone . I bought it because it looked like a good qualityproduct and Amazon 's description specifically stated it was for the Kindle Fire . Well it is n't . It does n't workat all and when she contacted Amazon about it they said & # 34 ; sorry & # 34 ; . Since I bought it over 30 days ago I can'teven return it or exchange it for something else so I 'm just out the money and she 's out the keyboard case.She 's going to have to use it for an expensive paperweight.VERY disappointed in Amazon 's advertising of the product and their lack of help when it 's their fault . I havespent a ton of money buying from Amazon but if their customer service is like this I may have to rethink things .	-1
My computer only has USB 2.0 but I figured I 'd get this model so when I upgrade I can use the USB 3.0 . Unfortunately it 's so slow in USB 2.0 that I 've given up on it .	-1
I bought the package because I needed an extra charger for my iPhone . The other items were a nice bonus . The charger worked well initially and charged my device from my iMac and my AC outlet . Unlike my Apple charger they only charged in one orientation . Then both stopped working at the same time . Both came back to life briefly but are now dead again . Very unreliable and a waste of my money . The dual USB charger works as does the car charger . The stylus is just OK . I guess overall I still got some value but now I will fork over the cash for an Apple charger .	-1
I have a & # 34 ; previous generation & # 34 ; Amazon Kindle Fire HD tablet , and there are very few cases of the type I 'm looking for available . What I was trying to find was a soft case similar to the others I 've bought for my other tablets ( the foam silicone cases ) . Fosmon made all the ones I 've bought ( for my Nook tablets , and my generic 7 & # 34 ; tablet ) , and I had hoped they could do the same for my Kindle Fire . Sadly , TPU is not a & # 34 ; soft case & # 34 ; material ( no matter what the adds say ) . It 's a hard plastic material , that is only marginally less slippery than the Kindle itself . The edges are a bit sharp , making it it even more uncomfortable than the Kindle without the case . Hopefully it will at least provide some protection if I accidentally drop my Kindle Fire.P.S . I sandpapered the sharp edges of the case to where it 's not more uncomfortable than the Kindle without a case , but it 's not exactly optimal . I would try again , but can ; t find anything that promises to be better .	-1
You could not go wrong on the price on this . I see losing the drive since there is no way to put it on a key ring . A good idea that still needs a little work .	-1
Has a slower read than my old 32gb 4 year old thumb drive , this one only reads at about 19MB/s , old one read at 30ish.Write is faster on this one though at about 12 vs 9 on my old one.Does have a nice metal case , that feels like it is going to break any USB I plug it into .	-1
loved it when it came looks cool and has a very tight fit only problem I cant use it in my car stereo I get an error-23 message I bought it to use in my car so i guess ill go back to 32 gigDAMN this sucks	-1
Died after ten minutes and ten gigabytes of use . Then it would n't show up in Explorer . I just do n't think that is acceptable .	-1
I had this device just over two month and used it only a few times , I would say no more than 3 hours total . It looks great with a middle range performance . But it just completely died . I have had no less than 20 USB flash drivers in the last few years . Never had one died on me . I guess I should 've never bought anything just for its looks . It is not recommended to anyone .	-1
Two things , one it 's a whole lot smaller than it appears in the picture . It 's 1 5/8 & # 34 ; long X 1/2 & # 34 ; wide at it 's smaller width . It 's so small I think it could be lost or misplaced easily.Secondly I did n't think it was going to go into my brand new PC . I had to push it really hard . It did go in and it worked but not so sure it 's going to be good on the pc bus port as it 's very gritting and difficult to push in . The original thumb or flash drives were small enough , they do n't need to too tiny.God Bless .	-1
i do n't know if the lens is defective or if it works this way . The aperture changes from 2.8 to 5.6 depending on the focal distance . It is 5.6 at minimum focal distance and 2.8 at infinity focal distance . This makes the lens worthless if every time your subject changes position the aperture changes , it makes it impossible to manually set up your cameras exposure when your subject moves but the lighting does not change . The lens I received is a worthless pile of junk . I am sticking with Nikon lenses from here on out .	-1
The first time I took it to a photo shoot , I opened it up and the metal rods in the frame collapsed . Very low build quality .	-1
Product works well so long as you are extremely gentle and rarely move it . The umbrella arrived slightly bent , and inspection showed it would bend very easily in high-stress corners . I returned it and will invest in a better name .	-1
This thing left permanent dents in the iPod . it literally leaves the dents when you put the case on , do n't get this case , it ruins your iPod permanently	-1
This case fits the new IPOD Touch Gen 5 perfectly , but it is totally worthless as the 'blue colored & # 34 ; protection ring around the camera lens and flash severely distorts any flash picture with an unacceptable blue tint to all flash pictures . If you only use the camera and Ipod features without flash , this case is well made but watch out for non Apple lightning and non Apple audio 3.5mm plugs , they will not fit the small cutouts of this otherwise great design . Ted	-1
Maybe it 's my micro USB chargers or putting multiple devices on this thing but when I do , it charges like molasses .	-1
This adds too much bulk to an already large phone in my view . I ended up with the Diztronic Matte Black Flexible TPU Case which is perfect for me ( hardly any bulk with just enough protection ) .	-1
Bottom line first : LaCie requires their proprietary software to & # 34 ; wake & # 34 ; the Cloudbox , format and reformat , and recover after disaster inevitably occurs . I bought the 3 Tb Cloudbox as an alternative to Apple 's more expensive Time Capsule . HUGE mistake ! LaCie brags about the product being & # 34 ; plug and play & # 34 ; with one click , but their guarantee is about as solid as & # 34 ; if you like your health care you can keep your health care . Period. & # 34 ; The first time one little thing goes wrong , the dominoes start falling , cascading in fact . And communicating with LaCie is like talking through 3 layers of veils . It takes forever , and they specialize in making it as tedious as possible . My Cloudbox was replaced once , but the replacement was no better than the original . It just does not work as advertised when serving as an Apple Time Machine backup disk . And although I 'm generally patient and good-natured , I can not emphasize enough that I grew to loathe the product , the company , and the abysmal service they rendered after the sale . So now , I 've got a shiny , white , expensive brick . And nothing short of a tuxedoed tech expert showing up at my door would make me ever buy anything else from LaCie .	-1
I was really excited to get this box because it was everything I was hoping for in a cheap package . But in the end , the promised speeds were never even close to being achieved . I tried to transfer a 60GB file via the ethernet option , the USB option , and wirelessly and let each one run for 24 hours ; no method finished and furthest I got , via the USB option , was 6GB . That is just unacceptable . And it 's too bad cause I really wanted this thing to do what it promised .	-1
The Cloudbox is far from LaCie 's best effort . My 3 Terabyte unit is connected to an Apple Time Capsule , and 3 times in the 11 months since I bought it the Cloudbox has suddenly just stopped working . The first time , it was unrecoverable and LaCie sent me a replacement unit . The second time , I had to reinitialize the unit , wiping out all my saved work and backing up everything from scratch , a risky procedure . Now , it has happened a 3rd time , and I am giving up the fight . I am frustrated and disappointed on 5 counts : ( 1 ) The unit has quit functioning 3 times in 11 months ; ( 2 ) The LaCie Network Assistant software ca n't & # 34 ; find & # 34 ; the Cloudbox on my network and does n't explain what to do ; ( 3 ) LaCie 's support-site instructions are indecipherable geekspeak ; ( 4 ) LaCie 's support system is clearly structured for the company 's convenience , not the customer 's . It is clunky , and requires several extra steps over days , not minutes , just to exchange communication ; ( 5 ) LaCie really does n't care that a customer has had so many problems.The company needs to hire somebody away from Apple to teach them how to write software instructions . It 's bad enough to make a clunky product , but even worse when the procedures to fix it are too technical for even a savvy user like me to figure out .	-1
This stick is a peice of junk . It never worked from the start . I would not recomend this to anyone . I hope I do not get sued for posting this one star review .	-1
I bought so many of the 150 Mbps model which comes with a software not just a driver and never had issues.This model , the 300 Mbps only comes with a driver , no software loads showing the signal bars , no way to get it working as I tried on 4 different PC's.I do not recommend this model , very disappointed , the company should investigate and solve this defective model .	-1
I recently upgraded my wifi router to a N router ( DLINK DIR 605L ) and I thought maybe is time for me to upgrade my 3-yr old ALFA 1000 wifi adapter . Boy , was I wrong . This thing is about half of Alfa 's speed.Very slow and bad connection.I was n't going to review this product originally but MEDIALINK kept on sending me e-mails reminding me to give this product a review on Amazon ... Well here is my review .	-1
I lost my Manfrotto 200PL plate from a night of star gazing . Ordered this and did n't know it was not a genuine Manfrotto , I bought two . The only good thing was that it fit in my Manfrotto head but I could n't unscrew the adapter from my camera or binocular mount because everytime the little clip you use would fall out . The silver clip was too big for the screw mount and did n't fit correctly . Piece of crap manufacturing . I returned them both and ordered a genuine 200PL from BHPhoto and it was only $ 4 more then this cheap copy . Skip this product ... .	-1
I usually like Built products , but I heat this one , . and for 34.99 it 's totally over priced . The cheap cover is not thick enough , no zipper , only an elastic band that leaves an indentation on the other side . The elastic corners that hold the Kindle in place barley fit over the corners , leaving me to worry about it falling out . I 'm returning it and not it costs me 6.98 to send it back . Thanks Amazon ...	-1
I rely heavily on Amazon reviews , purchased this product directly from the manufacturer back in 2011 , it worked for a few months then sporadically started dropping signal . Firmware upgrades were few and far between and getting support on the product was not possible . I ended up replacing this after about 6 months with a Cisco/Linksys router . After researching more I found that this is just a re-branded product . Save your money , do n't fall for this one .	-1
I can not recommend buying a Meidalink product . I 've had to use tech support quite a few times with configuration , since I have two of the 300 's and one 150 medialink wireless routers . I use one 300 for a wireless bridge . The men that are in support were very nice and polite , but either there are two ladies there , unless it was the same lady , and she is rude and very far from polite . So much so , that every time I got off the phone with her I was pretty bummed out for being treated like trash so bad . Just stay away from this company if they ca n't control their workers better than that . If you 're familiar with how good , polite and helpful Apple Support is , well just think of the other end of the spectrum in treatment with this company . Or lets say you went on a date and the lady you took to dinner was acting rude and as if she 's just too good for anyone , I would politely ask for the check and pay up and let her find her own ride home . That 's what it feels like . I like the product , but you will hate if you have to use tech support and you get a lady helping you .	-1
Mediabridge sucks big time ! ! ! I have never owned a product from them and never will . They sue critics of their company and allegedly pay for reviews .	-1
I am an IT admin.Avoid this product.there are many equivalent-in-cost routers offering better interfaces and support . And they actually wil work too ! By an Asus or Cisco/Linksys for home use . Unless you like wasting money.If you by this and call your local computer store for help they will tell you the same thing . Or worse , laugh at you .	-1
I bought this wireless router based on some reviews I found online that spoke highly of Mediabridge products . However , I have constantly had problems with my connection to the router dropping especially while doing any kind of bandwidth intensive activities . I have 4 laptops , 2 smartphones , 2 tablets , and a roku connected to the wireless access point and I often find that the router will start dropping connections if all my devices are connected . If I turn off a few of the devices it begins to work fine again . It seems to have a problem with the number of devices I have connected but I have n't found any specs that would tell me what the maximum supported devices is .	-1
First off , I feel generous giving it two stars but do n't feel like I can give it any less , as it does everything a router should do . Most of my problem lies in the fact that the description claims 300Mbps . I have service for 15 down and 1 up ( I 'd like more , but it 's expensive here ) and that should be plenty for my usage . I 'm only getting between 1 and 8 down out of this thing . 1-3 wirelessly and 2-8 wired . it 's awful . Sometimes it spikes to 8-10Mbps or so , but thats usually when I do n't need it ... For anyone out there thinking it might be the service , it 's not . I called the provider originally , they blamed the modem and router ( I did n't want to rent theirs ) so I did speed tests from each device . Out of the modem I get anywhere from 13-15Mbps down and 1 up just like I should , but as soon as I go through the router , it drops considerably . My wife and I watch netflix occasionally and this thing barely handles that . It 's awful , I wish I could return it but it 's been too long now . The range is decent for the size of the unit . It does n't really matter to me because I live in a small apartment . Most of the signal reach is outside my walls . I 've been looking for additional security and considered flashing the firmware to dd-wrt , but I ca n't find anywhere if that 's supported . I feel like I bought an off-brand and am really REALLY paying for it . I want my money back , and I want an Asus , Netgear or Linksys.To Mediabridge 's credit , the router was super easy to set up , came with an ethernet cable ( always a plus in my book ) and is easy to configure . I did n't feel right giving it less than two stars just because of the speed . Honestly , everything else was great . I will not be buying from Mediabridge again though . This router is no good to me if it does n't do what it was advertised to do consistently . I would n't even feel right selling it to someone .	-1
Terrible router . Gives really bad signal , especially when door is closed between computer and router . I would not buy again .	-1
I received the product , installed and thought I was finished . The product would not connect to the internet at all . I called the manufacturer and actually had to leave a message for someone to call me back . It was decided by the company that the product was defective and they would replace . I ended up just mailing it back and getting a refund . It was too much work waiting on the new one to come in , not to mention I could not connect to the internet until the new one arrived .	-1
This Medialink router simply suffers from poor performance , and below average signal range when compared with other routers I 've used . I own 4 computers , run a business doing computer work for over 10 years , and this is simply a poor performer compared to other routers I 've used by Linksys , TP-Link , and Netgear .	-1
What happened to Medialink ? ? This was a company that made very decent products at good prices . But not each and everyone of their products will function as intended , there are lemons in life and surely there are a few lemons of their products.I do n't have any personal qualms with this Medialink router - actually , quite the opposite . I have enjoyed this router , and the very first Medialink product I bought , a 4-Port USB Mini Hub ( model # : MUH4DX ) , continues to serve me well today still . The router , although not top notch in speed and quality , is a great value at $ 50.But then I hear this really preposterous story of Medialink personally attacking a reviewer for posting a negative review . For reasons I wrote earlier , not each and every of your products will function as intended , so when someone receives a lemon or a bad product , they are entitled to their opinions and reviews . You - Medialink - need to realize that as a public company serving products to the public , you are put under public opinions and scrutiny , whether fair or foul , that is the fundamental right of the American public . To attack them on a personal level and threaten them with biased litigation , you are destroying your good name and production.For people not familiar the story , you can read about it at TheVerge.com [ theverge.com/2014/5/9/5699724/amazon-strips-mediabridge-of-selling-privileges ] .The bottom line is , a company 's success is determined by its CUSTOMERS , and without us , you are nothing , or will be nothing . Do not forget your cardinal business model , and I do n't mean making money at any cost ! The cardinal business model is to ALWAYS please your customers .	-1
bad router saw this on reddit i would go with a different brand for sure plz do n't buy this if your smart	-1
I dont see any reasons to buy this particular router for this pricepoint . There are other established brands out there that have longer histories and proven track records of IMPECCABLE customer service . I have yet to see why I would buy this over the top tier brands .	-1
I really think that invokes the Streisand Effect whenever companies go after things in the wrong way . A legitimate business would try to make better products and offer better service and move up in the world .	-1
This is the second Medialink device I bought . The first one was an older model that I gave away . That one worked fine so I decided to stick with Medialink.This one has been a problem . Two main problems I see are:1 ) The wireless side keeps going down , meaning my wireless devices connected gets disconnected and when I try to reconnect , the devices can not see the SSID . It comes back after a few refresh on my iPhones . I could see my neighbor 's SSID , so I know the iphones is fine.2 ) A second issue is speed . The wireless devices will say they 're connected but they 're very slow , even with little use . This one is fixed with rebooting the router , though it becomes an issue again after a while.I 'm very disappointed with this device , and will not recommend it to anyone .	-1
I bought this router a while back and for me , it 's truly been the best router I ever had . I also have used in the past this company 's USB receiver too , with very good results . It 's unfortunate that their legal team decided to handle a bad review the way they did . I think I reviewed this when I first got it and gave it 5 stars , but now I am afraid I have to give them only 1 . I will keep using mine until it dies , but I will probably not buy again .	-1
This router provided very poor wireless coverage in my 2000 sq ft home . I did n't even get good signal throughout the downstairs ! I returned it .	-1
The Router kept disconnecting and reconnecting the network randomly between 5-10 minutes , continuously for 2 days before my patience ran out . Had to return it back .	-1
I loved the look and feel of this leather case however it did n't work with my Nook . I tried and tried to find the size of the plug in required , but I could n't , so that 's why I returned this item and asked for a refund	-1
i feel like i have to turn the up volume very high just to hear the dialog from the tv .	-1
We purchased two of these at a local store over the course of a month . The first one lasted about two months . The second one lasted one month . Both had all of the lights still functional but the sound completely quit . Tried brand new optical cables , tried running a/v cables . It has no HDMI hookup , so could n't try that . Nothing worked . Pieces of junk .	-1
Amazon has conflated two different Seagate Constellation hard drives in the description of this product . The title of this listing states : '' Seagate Constellation ES 3 TB 7200RPM SATA 6Gb/s 64MB Cache 3.5 Inch Internal Bare Drive ST33000650NS '' Seagate 's 3TB ES3 has a 128MB cache with a sustained data rate of 175MB/s and uses the part number ST3000NM0033 . What is listed here is Seagate 's 3TB ES2 drive , which only has a 64MB cache with a sustained data rate of 155MB/s and uses the part number ST33000650NS . This is a big difference . Do n't buy this drive if you are thinking you are getting an ES3 drive with the faster data transfer rates ( which I almost did ) .Amazon really needs to fix the description and offer the real ES3 drive , which was what I wanted to buy .	-1
We bought two of these tablets . There are two things that I think everyone ought to know before making this purchase.- The battery is 3000ma ( according to the documentation . ) My son plays 3D games ( mostly temple run ) and it lasts almost exactly one hour before being completely dead.- 4gb of ram may sound like a lot but it 's almost completely gone . Again , my son loaded 3 games before getting `` out of memory '' errors . We were able to remove a preloaded movie ( or trailer , I do n't remember ) and reclaim some space . But it 's small storage straight out of the box . Yes , you can easily expand the memory but you can also spend a little more money for one with more memory out of the box too.For us , the limited battery and limited storage was enough to send it back .	-1
It works , sync 's and powers up and charges . But once you 've stretched it you 're done . It never coils back up . Maybe it 's cheaply made , or mine was a knock off , but if you are thinking of buying this to keep from having long tangled cords , choose something else .	-1
Yikes ! Got this charger , and during the day while I was home , plugged it in for a trial run , and holy cow , this thing got so hot , you literally could hardly touch it ! Returned it immediately after only a couple of hours - DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL ! I had serious safety concerns for obvious reasons .	-1
Title says it all , the BlueAnt S4 never even sees it even though it supports A2DP . I can pair my phone or anything else to the BlueAnt , but not this .	-1
Screen covers are basically the same by any producer . Some are a little bit better or a little cheaper or give you a nice little felt cleaner to use , but largely its the same stuff.However , the one thing you NEVER want is to wait ages for your package to show . I bought the product on 1 June and got the expect shipping date 27 June to 11 July . WHAT IN THE WORLD ? ! ? ! ? ! No way I 'm ever buying these again ! They could GIVE THEM AWAY and I still would n't wait FOUR TO SIX WEEKS for flipping shipment . Rather than chasing good money after bad , I was forced to go into a local store and buy a screen cover to get me by until the ones I ordered arrived . GRRRRRR ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I 'd avoid this supplier like the plague ...	-1
This product is nearly impossible to apply without tons of bubbles or tiny dust particles getting on the sticky side.However , I found that the sheet of clear plastic backing material , which is cut out exactly like the flimsy 'screen protector ' , actually works better than the 'protector ' itself . I simply inserted the backing sheet between the screen and my leather iPad cover , which has a frame around the screen that holds it in securely in place . It works great . No bobbles , no dust . It protects better than the 'protector , ' and seems totally sensitive to the slightest touch .	-1
I purchased this burner primarily for backing up data . The Blu-ray Burner stopped working after 2 months and will no longer recognize Blu-ray disk also Burner will not burn a disk over 22 Gigabytes , After that it fails . Contacted Pioneer support after 2 weeks , No response . Lemons happen . However a good company will try to resolve the issue . Unimpressed with pioneer	-1
Of course most if not all OEM come with no cables or accessories that 's why they are generally cheaper than retail units.Only retail units come with software , so I knew what I was getting into.This drive did read and play blu ray movies very wellUsed the free VLC to watch my blu ray discsDid not like the fact that I did not see any firmware updates on their manufacturer websites , was n't sure if that meant they did not offer any firmware or the fact that they determine the drive to be compatible with all the latest discs and software . Anyway , the drive would not recognize either of my blank discs and with no possible firmware update I had to send back for a refund.If a drive will not recognize Verbatim or Optical Quantum discs then It is not a drive for me.Probably got a bum unit , but I decided if I need stereo equipment then I 'll give Pioneer a call.Ended up getting the quiet and all so reliable LG . The Pioneer drive was louder than the LG .	-1
Have two other writers to compare . This one is EXTREMELY slow even though it states it is speedy . Am thinking of returning the product . Do n't purchase ... ... .	-1
Bought this for mu Surface RT . The cable came bent in its box . When I plugged it into my Surface , and then my HDMI monitor , the product did not work . I had to bend the cables for the Surface to even recognize that a cable was plugged into it . Save yourself the trouble and buy a Female to Micro HDMI D Male Adapter instead . It is much cheaper , and works much much better .	-1
This computer is lethargic and Windows 8 is , in my opinion , a terrible operating system . It comes full to the brim with useless shovelware and makes installing new operating systems unreasonably complicated . My favorite moment of owning this computer was when I accidentally dropped it out of a moving vehicle and never had to use it again .	-1
I liked the price point on this card and I have had great success with other , regular Transcend class 10 SD cards for regular shooting and for recording video . I have a lower speed , 4GB EyeFi card and it works , but I thought the speed of the Transcend and the larger size would be a better solution for shooting wirelessly in a studio or in the field . My main use for this card would be in a classroom situation where I want my students to see the results of a shot immediately but on a screen larger than the one on my camera.I followed the limited instructions to put the card in use and downloaded and installed the Transcend WiFi Card app on my iPad ( 3rd gen ) . As one other reviewer described , I could usually not work fast enough to keep the wifi card network active to get my iPad connected . With the EyeFi card , it is never a problem for me . Once I did make the connection , I would lose it after only a few shots or if I went to some other menu for wifi card other than shooting.I am using - and have only tested the card on - a Canon 60D and , as another reviewer said , it may have something to do with how the camera is powering the card . However , I keep coming back to the fact that the EyeFi card DOES work ! I am considering sending the card back and trying the Toshiba FlashAir Wireless SD Card ( reviewed here : [ ... ] ) as an alternative to my EyeFi card .	-1
Tried everything , but could never get it to work in my Canon D50 . Memory function did work , but that is not what I wanted it for . I had installed latest firmware , but still no luck .	-1
I posted a review under the Transcend app by mistake . This card quit working properly in my camera within a few weeks -- just would n't record data . I put it away and forgot about it , but got it out recently , now it wo n't even format . Guess I have to contact Transcend for warranty service , but that 's a bother ...	-1
Bought this for a SCUBA trip . What a piece of junk . The pole traps air and becomes a bouyant joke . You have to unscrew it underwater and pump it like a bicycle pump to get rid of the air . This happens every time . Quality is cheap and plasticky.Find another one and do n't waste you money with this worthless POS .	-1
I do n't get these reviews . I used these for about a month . I do longish runs , may 13 miles or so . Anyway they worked perfectly for about 4 weeks . But now the right bud just falls out and wo n't lock anymore . I do n't know why , I think the plastic part is slipping off . I do n't have time to figure this out so will get some wrap around style headphones .	-1
The actual product I received was different . The screws were chromed and the head required a much smaller screw driver than usual HD screws ( and that pictured in the product description ) . The product is of good quality however but it just not what I led to believe I was buying .	-1
The battery did n't charge at all . In the process shipping it back for a refund . I knew I should have stuck with a & # 34 ; Dell & # 34 ; battery . Live and learn ... ... .The company has been more than helpful and nice and want to ship me the new one once they get the other one back .	-1
It was very inexpensive so I should n't have expected much but it failed quickly , and will no longer charge my tablet .	-1
The cover over the wiring connections on the big plug ( the one that goes into the tablet ) immediately came off the first time I removed the plug from the tablet .	-1
Not good unfortunately i bought this for my mom for her Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 she lost her OEM USB cable so i got her this to be able to charge and transfer things to her tab after two months her battery would die within 2 hours of fully charging , I need to see if i can buy a replacement battery now for the tablet or replace the tablet completely due to this cable . Can not recommend to anyone to purchase do not be fooled .	-1
This unit is 23W RMS x4 so you WILL need an amplifier . Factor in + $ 200 if you decide on this one.Comparable units from JVC / Pioneer are 65W RMS so I do not understand why this is so low powered.Mind you this is information is NOT listed anywhere on the Amazon product page . So I ended up buying it because of all the other info that drowns out this simple fact . Yes , I know , user error.First , a list of problems I encountered when using the unit : ISSUE # 1 My display developed a red line from top to bottom after 3 months.ISSUE # 2 Parrot support is TERRIBLE . When you call you are told to email when you email you get bounce backs.ISSUE # 3 Display glare : even with limo tinted windows you can barely see the glossy screen during the day.ISSUE # 4 The volume knob , you WILL miss it I promise you.ISSUE # 5 Just like the first line of the review mentioned , unit is very low on power.ISSUE # 6 Because of the low power output the total cost of ownership is $ 700+ when you factor in the amplifier you need.Second , the things I really like : AWESOME # 1 Android : the apps that come with the radio are OK. navigation is SUPERB.AWESOME # 2 Tasker : with a little tweaking you can setup you radio to auto-download your fav podcast when in range of wifi.AWESOME # 3 Torque : if you are not using your OBD2 with this radio you are missing out.AWESOME # 4 Supports TWO phones at once , it is a killer feature.AWESOME # 5 Built in wifi AND Bluetooth tethering . Mind you Bluetooth tethering does not work when dual-phone BT is enabled.AWESOME # 6 Pandora + other apps . This involves a lot of toying around but this is why you are buying an android receiver.The sound quality is good , no complaints there . Build quality good too and a plethora of USB ports is an awesome bonus.Overall for the price of $ 700 ( 500radio +200amp ) this is a 3 star unit . I have dinged an additional star for bad support from Parrot .	-1
I had the same experience as many other reviewers here , this ram wo n't run at 2400 on my system.Sending it back to try another brand.One star	-1
It is a good case but design is not . Top cover opens backward instead of forward . Because of this , when it is fully opened it may come into way of lens when it is extending . Similar old / retro cases like this had cover open toward and it worked well . I had to return mine .	-1
I purchased this TV because of the reviews . When I received it , the quality wasn & # 8217 ; t the best , but for the price , I thought I would try it out anyway . After two months , I moved the TV to another room . When I tried to watch it , the inner screen was cracked . I should & # 8217 ; ve known that it was very fragile because of the poor quality . I called Sceptre , the maker of the TV , and they told me that the warranty does not cover cracked screens regardless of it being internal . At the time , the TV was $ 224 . All I can say is that I wasted $ 224 . I would not recommend this TV or any other TV made by the maker . If you decide to purchase this or any other product made by them , I wish you the best .	-1
Got the Windows phone because of all the reviews I read about it and how great it was . I took it back the very next day and swapped it for a Galaxy 3 . Why ? 1 . For a guy who works with his hands , this phones buttons were hard to access and FIND sometimes ( i.e . wake up was on top which was hard to do single handed and you had to mash the thin petite little button sometimes , volume would get accidently pressed while waking or putting the phone to sleep ) . 2 . I liked the sleekness of it and the rubbery coating on the back made it feel secure in my palm but this seemed all for naught if I was to get a case which is a MUST for a smart phone . 3.The layout was decent but the `` tiles '' system seemed utilitarian and made it hard ( and sometimes irritating ) to customize . It felt like it took away your freedom of customization that Android systems allowed . You were only allowed black or white for your background and a preset palate of colors for your tiles . 4 . The app market was cruddy and none of the apps I wanted were there . 5 . When holding the phone to your head , it didnt have a `` phone '' feel ... I felt like I was holding a graham cracker to my ear ... didnt like it . This phone has a classiness and a chicness to it but for me , the Galaxy S3 was the better buy and all around better phone in terms of customization , apps , feel , screen size , and expandability . Keep trying Windows .	-1
It looks nice and hides easily . But thats where anything good about this cable stops . It shortedout day two , and bebefore that only gave a sub par image . I suggest getting a high end cable .	-1
I have tried copying video footage to a 64GB SD card with this card reader multiple times and the card was corrupted every single time . Formatted the card 3 times and each time the files and card was corrupted.Swapped in a different card reader and zero problems .	-1
After , a few days of use and adjusting the antenna , it stopped working and I opened it up and saw that where the antenna was , it was soldered poorly . The mistake they made was using a piece of metal tip from the antenna to the board , they should have used a piece of wire connecting the antenna to the board and that way it hold the solder stronger . I do n't recommend this for laptops . This would be good for desktop computer that stay in one place , plug it in and leave it there and do n't move it around .	-1
They stopped working in one ear after a week . I 've had 5 dollar headphones that have lasted longer . I did n't get much chance to test them out , but I will say they defitenly are n't worth the money if that 's how long they last . A few other things-they look nice-the microphone is awkward . You either have to take it off and leave it hanging there . It does n't go up and hide like some I 've had in previous ( cheaper ) headphones-the volume control does work on PCs even though it says it won't-they are slightly uncomfortable.Overall , what can I say ? They do n't work . Considering the price range of these there are much better options even if they did work .	-1
I was so excited about this kit till I actually mounted it on my 77mm Canon 17-40 lens . You can see the sides of the holder through the viewfinder . The only way to get past it is to zoom-in from 17mm to 24mm , which completely takes away the wide-angle capability of my lens.Why does the manufacturer provide the 77 adapter ring when there is clearly a problem using this kit with it.My package included a printed note which told me to email the manufacturer if I was n't satisfied . I composed a nice and polite email inquiring about the kit taking up space on the sides of my viewfinder ... .even requested that I be corrected in case I was mounting it wrong ... ... its been almost a week and no reply . You got ta love people who say & # 34 ; let me know if you have a problem & # 34 ; yet when you do they do n't even acknowledge you.Money spent on this purchase has gone to waste because I now have no use for this ... ... Extremely disheartened .	-1
When I purchased the new style Apple earbuds , my earclips ( BudFits from Innovelis , Inc. ) did not work with the new design , so I purchased these thinking they would be of similar quality . What a disappointment ! These are designed to fail frequently and one stud is almost ready to fall out of the ear clip before I have even started to use them . I will stick with the older style earbuds so I can keep using my BudFits until someone designs a durable earclip that works with the new style earbuds.If you do purchase these , be sure to look at the pictures on the web page to see how to to install them on your earbuds . There are no instructions in the package showing how they should be attached to the earbuds and if you have been using the BudFits , you may put them in upside-down which makes them even more cumbersome to use .	-1
I returned the item without actually recording anything ; I assumed it would record not just video , but also audio ... .it does not record audio and was of no value to a family man .	-1
It was full of smeared colors at high resolution and 60 frames - HD or FHD . At lowest resolution or 30 fps it was jittery . I tried 3 different SD cards . I bought one of the fastest cards in case that was the problem . Did n't even get around to diving with it .	-1
Although I have not had anything damaged by these adapters , I do n't trust them . They are certainly not made by Apple.However , the distrust is extended due to the fact that they rattle . Yes , when you shake them , they make noise.In one bulk order , I ordered 10 units . All of the units rattle . There is not one unit that does not sound like there is something broken inside of the supply rolling around . I have used these power supplies before and damaged the vibrate feature on my iPhone . I do n't trust the supply .	-1
I was hoping that these speakers would have a decent bass but they do n't . Bluetooth sounds much worse than using a wire but that 's not too surprising .	-1
It works but I ca n't say much beyond that . I opted for an Hoover bar which works exceptional ... .but this is cheaper . You get what you pay for and it depends on your taste	-1
i can not put in my ipad 4 into the mount because ipad 4 is too fat for the mount . the most poorly design thing i have ever bought .	-1
Well the first day my husband used it 2 of the snaps broke . I have been thinking of having it returned.I need one that it 's more sturdy .	-1
I do n't like it at all it falls out of the case every time I open it and i am afraid it wil brake I bought it to begin with so it would stay safe but it did n't click down in the case thing so when I open it it slides out and when I set it up as a stand it slides down , It is very bad ! ! !	-1
Got it for my daughter 's IPad Mini ... it 's not bad ... but the material is a little bit clunky and it does n't smell good ... I just throw it away when I got her an Apple Cover Case ...	-1
It 's not a quality product . The inside is not made with quality either . The frame is not well stitched and there are still threads hanging . I only recommend it for kids ' use .	-1
It 's horrible hdmi looks like crap it 's exactly what 60 bucks will get you in a projector ..poor quality all the way I really had hopes for it but oh well my mistake	-1
Do not like this case . It 's very pretty . That 's where it ends . It is supposed to sleep on closure . It does n't . It does n't stand straight and does not fit snuggly . I am very disappointed in this purchase and would not recommend it .	-1

For storage , I can just shove them in the pouch , the thick flat cord does not tangle.Update 3/9/2013 : One ear bud just stopped working . I really loved these while they lasted and treated them well so I am very disappointed that only one works now . Since they were so short-lived , I have to take off 3 stars .	-1
Gone though 3 crappy car chargers now . Thought I would pay more for a good one . This one was just as bad as the cheap ones . Do not waste your money ! ! ! Just wasted $ 15 with no refund .	-1
I have 2 old portable dvd players . One I from Envizen which I got years ago ( some affiliation to Azend ) . The other one is a ( cheap ) no name freebie I got from my bank for opening an acct . The Envizen one is / was a pretty upper ended one at the time . I bring these up because , in comparison , this new Azend player simply is not cutting it . I really have no complaints about my 2 old players other than they do not play blu-ray . Being this got pretty good reviews & I saw it had some connection to Envizen I opted to try this one out . ( Envizen had SUPERB customer services at the time ) . However , I do n't know what is going on with this player . First , it makes the whirring whining sounds that stop & go consistently every time you stop or start the dvd or it moves between previews . It 's pretty loud & even my cheap & # 34 ; freebie & # 34 ; is quiet as a mouse . But the reason I have decided to return is that the player is not resuming where I left off . If I pause or stop the dvd to come back & watch later , it starts right back at the beginning ! I went into set up & verified this feature was turned on & it is but can you imagine how aggravating it gets having to skip forward to try & find where you left off every time you close down . It does n't seem to matter if I stop or pause the dvd . If I shut the player off I 'm back at the beginning . That 's simply not right . Now if I had n't had 2 portables before this I might think I was doing something wrong but I just think this one is messed up so for this money I 'm not screwing around - it 's going back.So let 's say I got a lemon keep in mind you may have the irritating whining sound which may just be the way this thing works , it should n't -- do your home players do that ? do your music players in your car do that ? NO of course not . No reason a dvd player should make this sound either.Other things I 'd mention : it is pretty heavy in comparison to both of my other players . If you are going for portable normally you prefer them to be lighter . The picture is good , I would not say great . Again , in comparison to my non blu-ray players it 's really no better quality ! Sound : Ok , nothing great.Customer services : I posted my question / issue on here twice with no reponse & emailed the company service center w/o any response.In case you have n't caught on by now , I 'm overall disappointed even if I did n't have the issue with the last memory recall .	-1
I was so excited that about receiving this tablet especially after the good reviews I saw and the fact it was under $ 260 - ca n't go wrong , at least I thought.Out of the box , worked exactly as advertised . Display looked great , fast response time , and not a lot of pre-built apps so I did n't have to lose memory on items I was not interested in , which I also liked cause it saved me time from having to `` clean '' up the icons . It had standard android features and easy to setup wifi . Not too complicated for a user like me ( busy , working mom , tech savvy but not expert , and someone that appreciates finding quality items for lower prices- I 'm not brand driven . I like one item that I can carry around to help me stay organized and relax when needed . I have an iPhone but only 8GB so why I was looking for a tablet ) .After the first week , the tablet started responding slower . This is after downloading a whole bunch of apps and taking pictures ( which btw you can tell you had a very low megapixel camera , bad exposure ) . I also kept on getting an error message that actions were not being able to complete due to lack of storage . I knew it was impossible- tablet was 16GB ( I know you do n't get entire space ) and had a 16GB SD card so I checked settings and realized that the built in 16 GB was split in two . There was a system storage space then a separate storage space with a majority of the memory , like an internal SD card , then another section for my SD card . I would n't care about the split for the internal system if it would allow me transfer between the two but Nope , i had to transfer to my memory card , which was a lil annoying but did n't really bother me.Then a couple days after , after charging the tablet overnight using the charger that came with it , I turned on the tablet and the screen flashed a bright red color on startup , white backgrounds were showing up as a blue color , and tablet felt really hot . So I turned off tablet to allow to cool and when I turned on it was fine . So I got a lil concerned but still not thinking badly about it . The same issue happened again a few days later , but this time did n't go away ( I bared with it for 3 days before I decided to report it and return the item ) .Since Amazon was great and gave me a hassle-free refund , I started thinking if I wanted to give this tablet a 2nd chance ( every brand can have one defective item ) so I started thinking of the features I did n't like about it so I would know if I can tolerate it -- Had Flixster app but I could n't download or even play to watch Flixster movies directly to the tablet . When I am with the kids in a place that does n't have public wifi , it 's great being able to pull up movies to entertain . I do it with my iPhone so was hoping it could be done with the tablet.Speakers sounded good but when I used headphones , sound was muffled and was very low . I know it was n't headphones cause I use with iPhone and portable DVD player and sounds great.Low quality pictures - it did n't advertise better but I 'm thinking the low megapixel and the size of the screen just made the picture look more grainy so I think I need a higher megapixel camera .	-1
This thing would n't power up at all one day for no reason ! It died so fast , was n't expecting this to happen .	-1
I love foam earbuds , and I thought these looked good . I odered large and they still are so small that they fall out of my ears . I ended up punching a hole through foam ear plugs instead .	-1
I ordered these connectors because I have a need for them to extend coaxial cable . The connectors I received did not have the middle grip you see in the picture . This makes it more difficult to use . Please understand that they do work but without the middle gripping surface they are harder to put on and take off . A little disappointed in the product not being as shown .	-1
My brother asked me to set this box up for him yesterday . I plug in A/V to the old tv and nothing showed on the TV . Then , I plug it in the new TV with HDMI . I could not see the set up icon , box to set up the wireless connection . I went back and read the manual and still could not set it up . The manual just give you a very basic information.Besides , I do n't understand what the movienite is . I do n't really know if have have to set up the movienite account first , or just went straight to youtube . However , even for youtube , it takes forever to run the app.For the same money , if you have a new tv , buy chromecast from google . If you have old tv , buy something else .	-1
I have B & O ; P7 headphones , and need more power to drive them and reach their true potential . This did the job and I was very happy.But after about 10 days of use it developed the dreaded buzz that other reviewers have mentioned . A reset did n't fix it , so this is on its way back.Based on the number of people with the same issue , I must advise you to avoid this amp and try another brand .	-1
